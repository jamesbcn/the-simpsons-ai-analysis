{\an8}You fold it, you bought it.

Gee, business
stinks tonight.

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,480
Where's Barney, Lenny,
and Carl?

40
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,561
Ah, they never come
around anymore

41
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,227
now that they got
their mistresses.

42
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,236
Ah, might as well
close the dump.

43
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,988
I am going to drink
you under the table.

No, I am going to

-Aw.

46
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,161
(yawning)
Well, you're closing.

47
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,743
It's getting late.

48
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,698
My kids are probably wondering
where their daddy is.

49
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,118
There's got to be
some other place we can go.

50
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,077
Think, Moe, think!

51
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,126
(voice cracking)
Sorry. It's league night.

52
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,262
I couldn't give a lane
to my own mother.

53
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,089
I have no son.

54
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,142
Man, you go through life,

55
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,140
you try to be nice to people,

56
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,972
you struggle
to resist the urge

57
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,597
to punch 'em in the face
and for what?

58
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,404
For some pimply little puke
to treat you like dirt

59
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,058
unless you're on a team!

60
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,477
Well, I'm better than dirt!

61
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,975
Well, most kinds of dirt.

62
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,897
Not that fancy
store-bought dirt.

63
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,986
That stuff's loaded
with nutrients.

64
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,741
I can't compete
with that stuff.

65
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,123
That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc
with my self-esteem as well.

66
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,491
But who am I
to complain?

67
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,998
I'm tired of being
a wannabe league bowler.

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
I wanna be a league bowler.

69
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,166
(bell dings)

70
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,170
Hey...

71
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,591
We can be a team.

72
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,629
Excuse me, but my team
is ready to bowl!

73
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,215
You're short one person.

74
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,760
Uh... that
long-haired freak's

75
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,304
bowled with us
for years.

76
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,757
Oh I don't care
if it takes me all night.

77
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,058
I'm going to get me
that lobster harmonica.

78
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,192
Come on, lobstie!

79
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,438
Oh!

80
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,849
Oh, okay.

81
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,187
Then I just need
your $500 registration fee.

82
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,153
$500?

83
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,233
No problem.

84
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,238
Would you take
an out-of-state

85
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,779
two-party bad check?

86
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,032
No, I will not pay you
$500 for sex!

87
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,485
Aw, come on, Marge!

88
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,735
You're getting something
in return

89
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,657
and I'm getting a bowling team.
It's win-win!

90
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,997
It's sick! And I don't have that
kind of money to spend on sex.

91
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,424
Maybe you could get
someone with money

92
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,052
to sponsor your team...
like Mr. Burns.

93
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,800
Burns never gives money
to anybody.

94
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,012
Just last week,
I asked him for $1,500.

95
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,432
For what?

96
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,390
Aw, I gotta get the
third degree from you too?!

97
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,811
Tonight's homework
assignment is...

98
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,429
Oh, man.
Is it hot in here!

99
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,186
I better take off my sweater!

100
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,229
"Down...

101
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,112
"with...

102
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,439
...homework?"

103
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,983
(class laughs)

104
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,608
Don't look at it, children.

105
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,864
The shirt makes
a good point.

106
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,856
I'm with the shirt.

107
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,777
Homework rots.

108
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,025
(chanting)
Down with homework!

109
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,536
Down with homework!

110
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,749
(coughing)

111
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,327
As I was saying,
my yearly evaluation

112
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,247
couldn't have come
at a better time.

113
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,666
Well, Seymour, I must say,
for once I am impressed.

114
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,336
In fact, I am going
to give this school

115
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,014
a perfect 10.

116
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,013
I'll just write
the zero first.

117
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,557
Now a vertical line
to indicate the one...

118
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,141
STUDENTS:
Down with homework!

119
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,896
Skinner!

120
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,940
Why are there children
walking on my head?!

121
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,945
(gasps)

122
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,948
So... we meet again
"Mad Magazine."

123
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,071
How do you know
it's from Mad?

124
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,407
The year was 1968.

125
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,412
We were on recon

126
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,833
in a steaming Mekong delta.

127
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,332
An overheated private
removed his flak jacket

128
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,865
revealing a t-shirt
with an iron-on

129
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,668
sporting the Mad slogan,
"Up with mini-skirts."

130
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,052
Well, we all had a good laugh

131
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,089
even though I didn't
quite understand it.

132
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,592
But our momentary lapse
of concentration

133
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,844
allowed Charlie
to get the drop on us.

134
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,257
I spent the next three years
in a P.O.W. camp

135
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,096
forced to subsist
on a thin stew

136
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,141
made of fish, vegetables,
prawns, coconut milk,

137
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,896
and four kinds of rice.

138
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,229
I came close to madness

139
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,614
trying to find it here
in the states

140
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,110
but they just can't get
the spices right.

141
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,861
Uh, my punishment?

142
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,153
Hmm? Oh. I'm going to have
to think about that.

143
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,237
Meanwhile,
wear this home.

144
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,992
No!

145
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,617
I need some more ether.

146
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,294
I can still feel the movement
of the emery board.

147
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,294
We're fresh out, sir.

148
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,455
I'll get some more.

149
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,923
Leave the rag.

150
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,923
(sniffs)

151
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,264
Mmm!

152
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,144
Uh, excuse me. Mr. Burns?

153
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,719
Poppin' Fresh!

154
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,974
You glutinous
little doughboy!

155
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,057
Oh, there's something I've
wanted to do to you for years!

156
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,943
(giggles)

157
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,564
(giggling)

158
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,767
Ow!

159
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,487
Mr. Burns...
I, uh, was wondering

160
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,778
if you'd like to sponsor
my bowling team for $500.

161
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,124
Oh, why certainly,
Poppin' Fresh.

162
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,370
I owe my robust physique

163
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,741
to your tubes
of triple-bleached goo.

164
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,367
Whoo-hoo!

165
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,164
Hey, everybody!

166
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,577
If you want to ask Burns
for a favor, now's the time!

167
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,336
He's doped up or dying
or something!

168
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,049
Uh, excuse me.

169
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,129
I'd like
to request $17

170
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,175
for a push-broom
rebristling.

171
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,179
Why, it's that delightful
TV leprechaun!

172
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,391
I'm going to get
your Lucky Charms!

173
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,523
(drill grinding)

174
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,389
MOLEMAN:
Oh, no. My brains.

175
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:54,118
Hey, nice, quote
"uniforms", end quote.

176
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,995
This just in-- a new addition
to our "Worst-Dressed list":

177
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:57,963
Those guys!

178
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,167
Forget this.
I am far too fragile

179
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,927
to withstand an evening
of barbs like that.

180
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,799
Aw, come on.
If we quit now

181
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,386
we'll never know how badly
they're going to beat us.

182
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,891
Yeah, you're right.

183
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,313
That's the kind of thing
that would haunt you.

184
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,770
<i>Si!</i>

185
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,824
(laughing)
<i>Buenas noches, señoritas.</i>

186
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,068
What did he say?
What did he say?

187
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,230
Was that about me?

188
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,357
Okay, Otto. Pressure's on.

189
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,526
Don't choke, don't choke,
don't choke, don't...

190
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,485
choke!

191
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,453
Oh, man!
I knew I was going to choke.

192
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,287
Well, that's
a funny-looking strike.

193
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,792
Come on, guys, let's be the team
that supports each other.

194
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,836
(cheering) You can do it, Otto!
You can do it, Otto!

195
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,300
"Help each other out"
That'll be our motto.

196
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,471
You can do it, Otto!
You can do it, Otto!

197
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,641
Make this spare,
I give you free Gelato.

198
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,310
Then back to my place,
where I will get you blotto.

199
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,309
Domo aregatto,
Mr. Roboto.

200
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,232
You can do it, Otto!
You can do it...

201
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,152
Guys, I Made the spare. We won.

202
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,651
All right!
Way to go!

203
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,653
We did it!

204
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,815
Those beers are
five dollars apiece.

205
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,786
-Let me set the scene for you, Marge.
-All right.

206
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,875
It's a 7-10 split,
the hardest shot in bowling.

207
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,051
It was all up to me.

208
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,259
Oh!

209
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,129
So I got up all my
courage right away.

210
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,137
My lips started to move

211
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,509
and I came up with the chant
that won the match!

212
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,847
Who knocked down
the pins?

213
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,102
I don't know...
You know, some guy, uh...

214
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,024
Otto, I guess.

215
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,772
Good for him!

216
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,574
Yes, but Marge, you're not--
You're missing the point!

217
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,319
The individual
doesn't matter.

218
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,901
It was a team effort

219
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,356
and I was the one

220
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,066
who came up with
the whole "team" idea!

221
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,656
Me!

222
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,661
I can't believe Otto
picked up a 7-10 split.

223
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,664
He's phenomenal!

224
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,745
-But, but--
-Wow!

225
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,710
Several days ago,
a violent riot erupted

226
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,291
incited by an
inflammatory t-shirt slogan.

227
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,547
No, no, now, don't try to
remember what that slogan was.

228
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,840
To ensure that this frenzied
dance of destruction

229
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,514
is never repeated,
I have decided, starting Monday

230
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,354
all students will be required
to wear uniforms.

231
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,310
ALL:
Uniforms?!!

232
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,356
(Herb Alpert & Tijuana Brass'
"Spanish Flea" playing)

233
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,568
Say hello to our
little genius Martin

234
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,229
who looks even smarter

235
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,357
in this vest
and short pant combination

236
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,284
from Mr. Boy
of Main Street.

237
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,867
Or how about
little Lisa Simpson?

238
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,201
She'll have no reason
to play the blues

239
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,157
in this snappy ensemble

240
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,327
topped off with
a saucy French beret

241
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,666
that seems to
scream, "silence."

242
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,798
All right, pick your size:
"extra-small" or "extra-large."

243
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,096
We've got both.

244
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,929
No pushing now, I-- What?

245
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,765
Oh, I've just been informed
we've run out of "extra-large."

246
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,151
Go, Moe! Go, Moe!

247
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,728
Don't make Homer
shout out "D'oh!"

248
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,693
(cheering)

249
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,154
Woo-hoo!

250
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,453
-(pins clatter)
-(cheering)

251
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,494
All right, Snake,
make us proud.

252
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,209
One, two, three...

253
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,803
(rapidly) four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten. Bye!

254
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,090
Uh... we forfeit.

255
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,134
(cheering)

256
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,639
There it is, boys:
the Championship Trophy.

257
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,646
We will never possess it.

258
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,728
The Holy Rollers have won it
five years in a row.

259
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,234
MOE: They think they're
so high and mighty

260
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,737
just 'cause they never got caught
driving without pants.

261
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,453
(ridiculing laughter)

262
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,412
God-boy couldn't get a strike!

263
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,253
(laughing)

264
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,409
It's me-- Ned.

265
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,708
(laughing)

266
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,421
(screaming)

267
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,251
Mom! My slingshot doesn't
fit in these pockets!

268
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,378
And these shorts leave
nothing to the imagination.

269
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,295
These uniforms suck.

270
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,554
Bart, where do you pick up
words like that?

271
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,296
Yeah, Moe, that team
sure did suck last night.

272
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,388
They just plain sucked!

273
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,102
I've seen teams suck before

274
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,102
but they were the suckiest
bunch of sucks

275
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,104
that ever sucked.

276
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,685
Homer! Watch your mouth!

277
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,610
Got to go. My damn wiener
kids are listening.

278
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,319
We are not wieners!

279
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,689
Then what are you
dressed like that for?

280
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,105
BOTH:
They made us.

281
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,533
"Oh, they made us."
That's loser talk.

282
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,822
You got to start acting
more like me and my team--

283
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,026
the future league champions
of the world.

284
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,367
Nothing's going to stop us now.

285
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,952
Stop everything.

286
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,707
I don't remember
writing a check for bowling.

287
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,999
Sir, that's a check
for your "boweling."

288
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,253
Oh, yes.
That's very important.

289
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,705
Yes, sir. Remember that
month you didn't do it?

290
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,295
Yes. That was unpleasant
for all concerned.

291
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,341
Anyway, back to the checks...

292
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,755
Stop everything!

293
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,263
I don't remember
writing a check for bowling!

294
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,635
Hmm... the memo says
"To my pal, Poppin' Fresh."

295
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,694
Oh, yes... that greedy,
grasping glob of chemicals.

296
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,728
Probably one of your ether-induced
hallucinations, sir.

297
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,272
I'll check
the employee files

298
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,475
to see who
could pull off

299
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,565
such an impersonation.

300
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,110
Hmm, it was either
Pops Freshenmeyer...

301
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,319
or Homer Simpson.

302
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,369
Simpson, eh?

303
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,424
Let's shut down this
bowling scam right now.

304
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,126
Come on, Homer.
Come on, Homer.

305
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,223
Pretend this is baseball
and hit us a Homer!

306
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,393
-Way to go!
-Yeah! Yeah!

307
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,680
-Way to roll it.
-Yes, sir! Oh, yes.

308
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,725
By the way, rhyming "Homer"
with "Homer"--

309
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,388
(making Italian kissing sound)

310
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,557
Look at them, Smithers,
enjoying their embezzlement.

311
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,356
I have a much uglier word
for it, sir:

312
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,940
"misappropriation."

313
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:57,896
Simpson!

314
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,031
(gasps, man screams)

315
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,912
Listen here...

316
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,409
I want to join
your team.

317
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,531
You want to
join my what?

318
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,867
You wanna "what"
his team?

319
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,871
I've had one of
my unpredictable

320
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,252
changes of heart.

321
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,869
Seeing these
fine young athletes

322
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,705
reveling in the humiliation
of a vanquished foe...

323
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,302
I haven't felt this energized
since my last...

324
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,798
boweling.

325
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,550
Oh, man, he'll blow
our winning streak.

326
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,552
Yeah... call this an unfair
generalization if you must

327
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,006
but old people are
no good at everything.

328
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,346
Look, guys, it's not
that simple-- he's my boss.

329
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,392
I'll tell you what.

330
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,885
I'll give him a shot

331
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,226
and if he stinks
it'll be easier to tell him no.

332
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,613
(grunting and groaning)

333
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,573
(panting)

334
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,775
(muttering)

335
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,001
Welcome aboard.

336
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,210
(softly)
It wasn't any easier.

337
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,513
Ah, these uniforms
are a godsend.

338
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,220
Horseplay
is down 40%.

339
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,010
Youthful exuberance
has been cut in half,

340
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,604
and high spirits
are at an all-time low.

341
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,970
They've even begun
blinking in unison.

342
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,019
I love that sound.

343
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,022
Now, children

344
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,234
while you're having quiet time
I'm going to make sure my desk

345
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,364
is exactly parallel
to the rear wall.

346
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,914
Oh, there's something
I used to do

347
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,952
in this situation.

348
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,655
But... can't... remember.

349
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,787
Ha ho?

350
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,325
Whoa, I can't believe

351
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,298
I got booted off the team
for Mr. Businessman.

352
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,418
(snorts)

353
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,514
I bet I'll get
a little respect

354
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,259
once I get that
Harvard diploma.

355
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,812
Look at that!

356
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,105
All the way to the end
with only one push.

357
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,688
Ah, that's the third game
in a row he cost us, Homer.

358
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,737
Mama mia!

359
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,738
Hoot mon!

360
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,649
Yee haw!

361
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,108
Arr, me maties.

362
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,527
Arr!

363
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,696
Whoo! They begged me
to join their team.

364
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,664
Begged me.

365
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,709
Well, we certainly
got walloped tonight

366
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,999
eh, fellas?

367
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,002
(laughs)

368
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,133
Ow!

369
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,129
Well... ow!

370
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,840
Uh, Mr. Burns, next week

371
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,671
is the big
championship game...

372
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,756
Ah, yes, that silly
championship...

373
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,762
The only "ship" worth a damn
is friendship.

374
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,095
Look, here comes
the friend ship

375
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,931
sailing your way.

376
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,136
Ooh, here.

377
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,095
Let me get that,
friend.

378
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,270
Oops, lost a nail.

379
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,855
Well, that's leprosy
for you.

380
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,198
You're "it."

381
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,583
Now you are the one
who is "it."

382
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,115
Understood.

383
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,538
Well, I've got to hand it
to you, Seymour.

384
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,666
These drab student coverings

385
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,763
have created the perfect
distraction-free environment

386
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,299
thus preparing the children
for permanent positions

387
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,394
in tomorrow's mills
and processing facilities.

388
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,100
Best of all, with less than
a minute to go before I leave

389
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,891
absolutely nothing
has gone wrong.

390
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,096
(thunder rumbling)

391
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,515
Well, it is
starting to rain

392
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,935
but I can hardly be blamed
for that, can I?

393
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,824
(both laughing)

394
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,572
Yes, very good.

395
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,541
Wow, look at all
the colors, man!

396
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,334
Red, green,
yellow, orange.

397
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,838
I remember all of these.

398
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,589
I'm freakin' out!

399
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,722
Hey, something's
coming back to me.

400
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,970
Down with homework.

401
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,642
And down with uniforms.

402
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,101
(cheering)

403
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,057
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

404
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,516
Skinner!

405
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,025
Why aren't these
uniforms colorfast?

406
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,778
I don't understand it.

407
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,740
I got them at the same place
I buy mother's dresses.

408
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Good Lord, Mother's in the park.

409
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,656
Now this, I gotta see.

410
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:18,122
Aw, Marge, we were so close
to winning the championship.

411
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,623
Now, thanks to Burns,
it's never going to happen.

412
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,126
And I spent so much time
building that trophy case.

413
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,881
Homer, maybe Mr. Burns
will bowl a great game

414
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,045
and you will win
your championship.

415
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,184
So you're saying
we're definitely going to win?

416
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,432
Whoo-hoo!

417
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,683
I won't need this
any more!

418
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,306
(toilet flushing repeatedly)

419
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,518
Marge, someone
broke the toilet.

420
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,026
Don't worry
about nothing, Homer.

421
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,367
I have a feeling
that Mr. Burns

422
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,833
is going to have
a little accident

423
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,834
that might keep him

424
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,825
from bowling
with us tonight.

425
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,877
Heh, heh, heh.

426
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,875
Smithers, I'm afraid

427
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,724
I won't be able
to play tonight.

428
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,680
My old gimpy knee
has gone akimbo again.

429
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,891
Take that!

430
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,850
Ooh... Smithers.

431
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,022
That precision assault
popped it back into place.

432
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,771
Thank you, masked stranger.

433
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,272
D'oh, he's gonna
ruin everything.

434
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,314
All right, that's it, Homer.

435
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,516
Either Burns goes or Moe goes.

436
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,227
Yes, I am afraid that I am
going to have to make

437
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,647
a similar threat

438
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,235
with my name
in place of Moe's name.

439
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,820
So, who's ready
to kick

440
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,115
some Christian
keister?

441
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,948
Oh, uh, Mr. Burns,
as team captain

442
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,405
it's my duty
to inform you that...

443
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,826
Oh, I almost forgot.

444
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,464
I brought you all
a little something.

445
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,209
Aw, would you look at that?

446
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,094
"The Pin Pals."

447
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,591
(gasps)

448
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,223
At last, I finally
have a garment

449
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,879
fine enough to be married in.

450
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,718
I've always been wealthy

451
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,143
but this is the first time
I ever felt rich.

452
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,893
Aww!

453
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,885
Now Homer, you were about
to say something to me?

454
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,937
You're off
the team.

455
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,980
What?

456
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,653
(nervous laughter)

457
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,771
Homer!

458
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,358
He's just ribbing you, Monty.

459
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,992
-Yes!
-Oh-oh-oh, you guys.

460
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,120
(grunt)

461
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,913
Hey-hey-hey!

462
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,466
Hallelujah!

463
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,969
-Hey!
-Hallelujah!

464
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:39,974
-Oh!
-Oh!

465
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,943
Nice one, Homer.

466
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:47,899
Thanks.

467
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,566
Okay, the Holy Rollers are ahead
by one pin.

468
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,900
And we only have
one bowler left: Mr. Burns.

469
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,712
(grunts)

470
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,841
Next time, a few steps more
toward center, don't you think?

471
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,801
Goodbye,
trophy.

472
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,685
Whoa! Whatever I got
a hold of, it's big.

473
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,822
(grunting)

474
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,243
Yes!

475
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,197
Excellent!

476
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,998
Yes!

477
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,582
(plays harmonica note)

478
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,917
Whoo-hoo! We won! We won!

479
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,223
You mean I won.

480
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,011
But we were
a team, sir.

481
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,345
Oh, I'm afraid I've had one

482
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,969
of my trademark
changes of heart.

483
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,176
You see teamwork
will only take you so far

484
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,807
then the truly evolved person

485
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,693
makes that extra grab
for personal glory. Now...

486
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,401
I must discard
my teammates

487
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,651
much like the boxer

488
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,072
must shed roll
after roll

489
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,490
of sweaty, useless,
disgusting flab

490
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,108
before he can win
the title. Ta!

491
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,866
I guess some people
never change.

492
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,699
Or they quickly change
and then quickly change back.

493
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,036
You know what?

494
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,911
We don't need him
or his trophy.

495
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,038
We got each other,
huh?

496
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,915
