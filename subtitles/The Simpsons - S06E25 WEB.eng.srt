1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,454
Ah, is there nothing
so intoxicating

3
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,581
as the school hallway
at early morn?

4
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,252
Hm. School normally
doesn't smell so rank.

5
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,964
Ah, washbasin fresh.

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,091
That funk must be coming
from one of the classrooms.

7
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,722
Ah, poor fellow.

8
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,557
Crushed by his own
water bottle.

9
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,023
Willie, sometime
over the holiday weekend

10
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,983
the beloved
grade four gerbil, uh...

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,860
Super Dude,
lost his life.

12
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,546
I need you to air out
the classroom and give.

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,650
Super Dude a proper burial.

14
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,203
Yeah, you're lucky you're
getting a decent burial.

15
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,455
Me own father
got thrown in the bog.

16
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,836
What in the name of
Saint Ephisiocritus?

17
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,971
Yuck, what reeks?

18
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,182
Smells like one
of Van Houten's.

19
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,725
It does not.

20
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,524
Miss Hoover,
the floor is shaking.

21
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,068
Ralph, remember the time
you thought the...

22
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,467
Now, before we adjourn,
gentlemen, I have

23
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,701
one last matter
of utmost importance.

24
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,411
I need to send this parcel

25
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,747
with the profit projections
to Pete Porter in Pasadena

26
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,791
and it absolutely
positively

27
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,919
has to be there overnight.

28
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,171
- Pete Porter. Pass it on.
- Pasadena, promptly.

29
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,006
Package to parcel
processing, pronto.

30
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,634
Profoundly pressing package of
power plant profit projections

31
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,736
for Pete Porter in Pasadena.

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,470
- Priority?
- Precisely.

33
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,317
Here's your package,
Mr. Burns!

34
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,197
My name is the return address,
you senseless dunderpate.

35
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,908
Smithers, who
is this nincompoop?

36
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,618
I've worked here
for ten years

37
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,328
and my boss doesn't
even know my name.

38
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,664
Well, that's going
to change right now!

39
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,457
My name is Homer J. Simp...

40
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,042
Ow! Son.

41
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,336
Hmm, sounded large
when I ordered it.

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,339
I can't make hide nor hair
of these metric booby traps.

43
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,259
My Lord!

44
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,886
Such destruction.

45
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,014
Superintendent Chalmers!

46
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,057
- How are you going?
- Why is it when I heard

47
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,101
the word "school"
And the word "exploded"

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,604
I immediately thought
of the word "Skinner"!

49
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,458
Congratulations, gentlemen,
your custodian struck oil.

50
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,252
You're standing on top of
the richest elementary school

51
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,153
in the state.

52
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,362
He also found this.

53
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,782
Thank you, Super Dude.

54
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,876
A non-profit organization
with oil?!

55
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,377
I won't allow it.

56
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,004
An oil well doesn't
belong in the hands

57
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,965
of Betsy Bleedingheart
and Maynard G. Muskeyvote.

58
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,135
Sir, have you had enough

59
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,930
exercise for this morning?

60
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,848
No.

61
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,309
Let's go
another 20 miles.

62
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,612
Hello, Lenny,
Carl, Guillermo.

63
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,988
Hello, uh...

64
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,327
Don't take it so hard, Homer.

65
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,746
He's always screwing
up people's names.

66
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,706
Yeah, at the picnic
he thought my son Renaldo

67
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,791
was my son Rolando.

68
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,874
Can you believe that?

69
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,422
Superintendent,
we made the front page today.

70
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,927
Ah... What's that say
under your hand there?

71
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,929
It's an unrelated article.

72
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,138
It's an unrelated article?

73
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,808
Within the banner headline?

74
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,185
Yes. Now to redirect
our conversation slightly,

75
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,229
I had a few ideas on how
to spend this oil money.

76
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,939
Well, we could give
each student

77
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,357
a full
college scholarship.

78
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,367
Oh, mercy...

79
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,290
Seriously, though,
before we draw up the budget

80
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,996
I believe the students
and faculty have

81
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,289
a few suggestions.

82
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,083
I want a crystal bucket
for my slopwater.

83
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,544
Oh, and a brand new
filthy blanket.

84
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,964
The cafeteria staff

85
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,508
is complaining about
the mice in the kitchen.

86
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,218
I want to hire a new staff.

87
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,514
I'd like to start a jazz program
for the music department.

88
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,683
We've got a really great
instructor lined up.

89
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,520
Tito Puente!

90
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,107
He's ready to give up
the drudgery

91
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,650
of the professional
mambo circuit

92
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,610
and settle into a nice
teaching job.

93
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,280
Man, it would
be my pleasure!

94
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,240
Lisa has told me
all your students

95
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,784
are as bright and dedicated
to jazz as she is.

96
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,078
Let's go now, Mr. Puente.

97
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,874
Chocolate microscopes.

98
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,834
You know those guitars
that are, like,

99
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,461
double guitars, you know?

100
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,171
More rubber stamps.

101
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,729
Principal Skinner,
this is your secretary.

102
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,068
There is one last student
here to see you.

103
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,178
That's odd.
I don't have a secretary

104
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,388
or an intercom,
but send him in.

105
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,515
Ahoy, there, Dean.

106
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,839
I understand you're taking
suggestions from students, eh?

107
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,606
Well, me and
my fourth form chums

108
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,399
think it would
be quite corking

109
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,110
if you'd sign over your oil well
to the local energy concern.

110
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,654
Mr. Burns...

111
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,698
It was naive of you
to think I would mistake

112
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,409
this town's most prominent
104-year-old man

113
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,803
for one of my
elementary school students.

114
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,537
I want that oil well.

115
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,414
I've got a monopoly
to maintain.

116
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,184
I own the electric company
and the water works

117
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,959
plus the hotel
on Baltic Avenue.

118
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,087
That hotel's a dump, and
your monopoly's pathetic.

119
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,547
The school's oil well
is not for sale

120
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,966
particularly to a black-hearted
scoundrel like yourself!

121
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,676
I see.

122
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,471
Then I'll just have to...
attack you!

123
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,474
I must have that oil.

124
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,853
Smithers,
help me subdue this...

125
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,230
beast.

126
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,898
Sorry, sir,
this is all I could find.

127
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,149
Take that!
And that!

128
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:42,902
Please don't waste those.

129
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,076
I'm happy for
the school.

130
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,595
It sounds like this money
is gonna provide

131
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,121
a lot of new opportunities.

132
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,789
Big deal.

133
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,642
They didn't approve my idea.
They said it was unfeasible.

134
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,210
It is unfeasible to
resurrect the dead, Bart,

135
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,087
and even if
the Three Stooges were alive

136
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,815
I doubt they'd want
to hang around with you.

137
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,316
Oh, yeah. I guess they'd
probably want to be

138
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,008
with their families
or something, huh?

139
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,844
Oh, I hate my job.

140
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,554
I mean, what's the point
when your boss

141
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,013
doesn't even
remember your name?

142
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,724
- I have an idea.
- What? What's your idea?

143
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,869
When my father was first trying
to catch my mother's eye

144
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,354
he sent her a box of candy
with his photo in it.

145
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,481
After that,
she never forgot him.

146
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,191
That's all well and good

147
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,027
but it's not really your idea,
is it now, Marge?

148
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,779
That's it.

149
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,198
Fumble about with
your widgets and do-bobs.

150
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,284
It'll all be
a monument to futility

151
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,494
when my plan comes to fruition.

152
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,455
Sir, uh...

153
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,914
what I'm about
to say violates

154
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,416
every sycophantic urge
in my body

155
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,209
but I wish
you would reconsider.

156
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,173
This isn't a rival company
you're battling with.

157
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,172
It's a school.
People won't stand for it.

158
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,590
Pish-posh.

159
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,009
It will be like taking candy
from a baby.

160
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,303
Say, that sounds like a larf.

161
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,096
Let's try it right now.

162
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,433
There's some candy
right here, sir.

163
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,643
Why don't we eat this
instead of stealing?

164
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,270
Oh, very well.

165
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,068
Look, there's
a photo in here.

166
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,863
Mmm, Yes.
I believe that's little.

167
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,266
Maggie Simpson,
the baby who found

168
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,074
my precious
teddy bear, Bobo.

169
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,784
Oh, and that Simpson mutt.

170
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,120
My former guard dog.

171
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,165
Ooh, and that's Bart Simpson.

172
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,968
He was my heir for a
brief period, you know?

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,710
Yes, sir.
I remember.

174
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,798
Anything left?

175
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,468
Uh... only the sour
quince log, sir.

176
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,222
Ew. Dispose of it.

177
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,265
And send a thank you note

178
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,602
to Marge, Bart, Lisa
and Maggie Simpson.

179
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,152
Today Springfield Elementary
embarks on a new era...

180
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,946
An era of unbridled spending

181
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,614
where petrodollars will fuel

182
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,616
our wildest
educational fantasies.

183
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,036
These young minds will enjoy
every academic advantage

184
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,205
till they enter
Springfield High School

185
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,373
which has no oil well.

186
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,250
We got an
air hockey table.

187
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,460
Fine. Now to switch on
our oil pump

188
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,462
for the very first time,

189
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,298
here's our top student,
Lisa Simpson.

190
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,382
Nerd!

191
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,392
There's no pressure!

192
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,519
Someone else
has tapped this well.

193
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,602
Ay caramba!

194
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,283
Soon that
mighty apparatus

195
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,702
will burst forth with
its precious fluid.

196
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,412
Almost sexual,
isn't it, Smithers?

197
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,163
Meh. Huh?

198
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,041
Oil ho!

199
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,086
Huzzah!

200
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,010
Whoa!

201
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,573
Holy Christmas!

202
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,912
Your dog's condition has been
upgraded from stable to frisky.

203
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,539
And he's free to go.

204
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,392
His legs should be as good
as new in a few months.

205
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,834
In the meantime,
he'll have to use

206
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,086
the wheelabout.

207
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,547
I'll get even with whoever
did this to you, boy.

208
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,631
I swear it.

209
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,300
Whoops.
Almost forgot.

210
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,844
Wouldn't want you gnawing
on those casts, eh, boy?

211
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,725
I'm afraid
we've got no legal recourse

212
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,786
against Mr. Burns and his
slant drilling operation.

213
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,104
The oil belongs
to whoever pumped it first.

214
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,190
What about all
the expensive stuff we wanted?

215
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,941
- Can we still have it?
- No.

216
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,320
- Blast it!
- In fact,

217
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,238
to pay for the construction
and operation

218
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,865
and demolition
of our new derrick

219
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,092
the school will
have to eliminate

220
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,135
all nonessential programs...

221
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,535
- Music...
- What?

222
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,912
And maintenance.

223
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,707
I'll kill that Mr. Burns!

224
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,711
And... wound that Mr. Smithers.

225
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,171
Guh, out of my way!

226
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,007
Oh, no,
that's awful, Mr. Puente.

227
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,175
What?

228
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,136
Oh. He owns
the nuclear power plant.

229
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,264
Yeah, I'd like to settle
his hash too.

230
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,725
Dad, how can you work
for a man like Mr. Burns?

231
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,185
Well, he's not all bad.

232
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,020
He did send me
this nice thank-you card.

233
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,106
"Marge, Bart,
Lisa and Maggie."

234
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,983
Dad, this doesn't have
your name on it.

235
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,198
Kids, would you
step outside for a second?

236
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,158
F...

237
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,916
Dear Lord, that's the loudest
profanity I've ever heard.

238
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,713
These fumes aren't
as fun as beer.

239
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,381
Sure, I'm all dizzy
and nauseous

240
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,592
but where's the inflated
sense of self-esteem?

241
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,932
Hey, if you guys are
getting loaded off them fumes,

242
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,642
I'm gonna have
to charge you.

243
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,645
Man alive,
there are men alive in here.

244
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,565
I'm detecting over 20
different toxins in the air.

245
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,610
All right, everybody out.

246
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,738
As long as Burns is pumping oil,
this bar is closed.

247
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,281
Damn Burns.

248
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,616
Let me just get one thing.

249
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,286
Me, too.

250
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,458
Now there's the inflated
sense of self-esteem.

251
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,387
Earthquake!

252
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,560
Nurse.

253
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,643
- Nurse.
- Nurse!

254
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,631
Well, sir, you've certainly
vanquished all your enemies...

255
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,966
The elementary school,
the local tavern

256
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,200
the old age home.

257
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,368
You must be very proud.

258
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,912
No, not while my
greatest nemesis

259
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,580
still provides
our customers

260
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,999
with free light,
heat and energy.

261
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,961
I call this enemy the sun.

262
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,056
Since the beginning of time

263
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,325
man has yearned
to destroy the sun.

264
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,267
I will do the next best thing...

265
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,102
Block it out.

266
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,567
Good God!

267
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,236
Imagine it, Smithers.

268
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,113
Electrical lights and heaters
running all day long.

269
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,866
But sir, every plant
and tree will die.

270
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,035
Owls will deafen us
with incessant hooting.

271
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,829
The town sundial
will be useless.

272
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,748
I don't want any part
of this project.

273
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,543
It's unconscionably
fiendish.

274
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,211
I will not suffer
your insubordination!

275
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,754
There has been
a shocking decline

276
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,131
in the quality and quantity
of your toadying, Wayland.

277
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,633
And you will fall into line.

278
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,134
Now!

279
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,387
No. No, Monty, I won't.

280
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,557
Not until you step back
from the brink of insanity.

281
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,725
I'll do no such thing.

282
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,352
You're fired.

283
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,860
Take that, Bowlarama.

284
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,319
Take that, convenience mart.

285
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,155
Take that, nuclear power pl...

286
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,490
Oh, fiddlesticks.

287
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,249
I must say Mr. Burns is
being awfully inconsiderate.

288
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,084
Selfish even.

289
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,880
Burns needs some serious
boost-a-fazoo right, Dad?

290
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,881
Dad?

291
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,340
Homer!

292
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,070
Sorry, Grandpa. It's just
that for a second,

293
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,804
it looked like
Dad had melted.

294
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,848
Well, get used to it,
'cause I'm living here now.

295
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,058
I ain't going back
to the retirement home

296
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,061
until they fish my bed
out of that sinkhole.

297
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,771
Strained carrots
for Maggie.

298
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,231
Strained carrots
for Grandpa.

299
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,649
I want a bib, too.

300
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,819
Smithers, who is
that ignoramus?

301
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,362
Smithers, who is
that lallygagger?

302
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,239
Who is that blubber pot?

303
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,699
Who is that baffle wit?

304
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,010
Lummox, puddinghead,
limp noodle.

305
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,118
Drizzlepuss.
Fumbleface.

306
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,953
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

307
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,496
Look out!

308
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,664
What?

309
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,669
Just a minute.

310
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,141
Who the devil are you?

311
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,354
Homer Simpson.

312
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,831
What are you talking about?
Make sense, man.

313
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,357
Homer Simpson!
Shut up!

314
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,275
I can't understand
a word you're saying.

315
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,276
- Homer Simpson!
- You're just babbling incoherently.

316
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,195
My name is Homer Simpson!

317
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,048
Oh, you're a dead man, Burns.
Oh, you're dead.

318
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,490
You're dead, Burns!

319
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,952
Hey, the lamp's
running away.

320
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,411
That's my dog, man.

321
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,038
So long, lamp.

322
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,874
Now, stop loafing and
help your grandpa unpack.

323
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,919
Wow!

324
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,505
That's my old
Smith & Wesson.

325
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,798
If you're going
to play with it

326
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,942
be careful
'cause it's loaded.

327
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,801
Bart, put that down!

328
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,511
Guns are very dangerous.

329
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,988
And I won't have
them in this house.

330
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,015
How can you have a house
without a gun?

331
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,142
What if a bear
came through the door?

332
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,853
I'm going to bury it
in the yard

333
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,689
where little
hands can't get to it.

334
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,899
You should have
fired into the air.

335
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,984
She would
have run off.

336
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,863
People, take it easy.

337
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,032
We're all upset
about Mr. Burns' plan

338
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,659
to block out our sun.

339
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,495
It is time for
decisive action.

340
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,580
I have here a polite
but firm letter

341
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,207
to Mr. Burns' underlings

342
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,836
who, with some cajoling,
will pass it along to him

343
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,879
or at least give him
the gist of it.

344
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,715
Sir, a lot of people
are stroking guns.

345
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,466
Also, it has been brought
to my attention

346
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,468
that a number of you
are stroking guns.

347
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,971
Therefore, I will step aside
and open up the floor.

348
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,474
Mr. Burns was the closest
thing I ever had to a...

349
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,184
friend.

350
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,269
But he fired me.

351
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,895
And now I spend my days

352
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,773
drinking cheap scotch
and watching Comedy Central.

353
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,150
Oh, dear God.

354
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,152
It's not that bad.

355
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,112
I never miss
"Pardon My Zinger."

356
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,948
Burns cost me my groundskeeping
job at the school

357
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,535
and I'm too superstitious to
take the one at the cemetery.

358
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:20,247
'Cause of him,
I lost my room, my things,

359
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,667
and my buddy's collection
of old sunbathing magazines.

360
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,044
You bastard.

361
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,462
I lost my bar!

362
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,963
I lost his bar!

363
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,965
He robbed the school of music!

364
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,693
He robbed the school
of financial security!

365
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,052
He robbed
the school of Tito!

366
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,595
He can't remember my name!

367
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,222
He's causing us all to yell!

368
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,141
Look what he did
to my best friend.

369
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,018
Wha...?

370
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,770
No. My dog.

371
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,863
Oh, those wheels
are squeaking a bit.

372
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,074
Perhaps I could sell him
a little oil.

373
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,036
You twisted old monster!

374
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,708
I've decided
to protect myself

375
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,269
ever since
I was attacked in my office

376
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,461
by an unidentified assailant.

377
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,715
Burns, your scurvy schemes

378
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,885
will earn ye a one-way passage
to the boneyard.

379
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,262
I'd like to hear
from Sideshow Mel.

380
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,681
I'll see to it
that Mr. Burns suffers

381
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,102
the infernal machinations
of hell's grim tyrant.

382
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,353
Yeah.

383
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,105
Ooh, you all talk big

384
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:30,109
but who here
has the guts to stop me?

385
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,990
Mm-hmm. Very well.

386
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,575
One last question...

387
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,996
Have you ever seen
the sun set at 3 p.m.?

388
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,416
Ay. Once, when I was
sailing around the arctic...

389
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,876
Shut up, you.

390
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,046
Take one last look
at the sun, Springfield.

391
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,444
Hey, hey!

392
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,363
I've been in Reno for six weeks.

393
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,781
Did I miss anything?

394
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,991
What the...

395
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,162
Eternal darkness.

396
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,580
Well, that's just great.

397
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,624
Listen, someone's got
to get that Mr. Burns.

398
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,128
Where's a gun-toting lowlife
when you need one?

399
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,546
Sorry.
I was in the can.

400
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,385
Perpetual twilight

401
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,305
bathed in the glow of
Burns' brand electricity.

402
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,183
Hello, lamppost.

403
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,642
What you knowing?

404
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,270
I've come to watch
your power flowing.

405
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,359
That's odd. Mr. Smithers
left his jacket behind.

406
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,697
Whoa, that's odd.

407
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,380
Principal Skinner
left his mother behind.

408
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,540
That's odd.

409
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,585
Where's Homer and Bart
and Lisa and Grandpa?

410
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,051
After all these years

411
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,345
things are finally
starting to go my way.

412
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,055
I feel like celebrating.

413
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,474
I... Oh, it's you.

414
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,767
What are you
so happy about?

415
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,102
I see.

416
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,063
Well, I think you'd
better drop it.

417
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,481
I said drop it!

418
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,944
Get your hands off...

419
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,572
Where is everybody?

420
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,747
Hey, man, are you okay?

421
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,208
I won't...

422
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,334
dignify that...

423
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,710
with a response.

424
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,215
Mr. Burns has been shot.

425
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,883
Just a minute.

426
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,386
This isn't
Mr. Burns at all.

427
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,762
It's a mask.

428
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,309
Wait. It is Burns.

429
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,603
His wrinkly skin
looks like a mask.

430
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,563
I don't think we'll
ever know who did this.

431
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,275
Everyone in town's
a suspect.

432
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,327
Well, I couldn't possibly
solve this mystery.

433
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,579
Can you?

434
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,417
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

435
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,502
I mean, you know,
it's my job, right?
