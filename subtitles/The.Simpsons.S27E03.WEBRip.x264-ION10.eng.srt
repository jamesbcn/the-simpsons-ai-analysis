were ashamed to say at the time,

00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,696
Patty, all your tests are positive.

178
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,160
I mean, negative.
Always get those two confused.

179
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,161
You're fine.
(chuckles)

180
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,953
But I still smell smoke.

181
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,706
(sniffs)
That's odd.

182
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,828
So do I.

183
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,124
Do you smell anything, Selma?

184
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,877
Hmm, uh-uh, nope.

185
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,879
Wait a minute.

186
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,300
Are you smoking?

187
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,340
That's right, I am.

188
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,177
I quit for only ten minutes
before I relapsed.

189
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,563
And it was the best cigarette of my life.

190
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,902
(scoffs)
I have never been angrier at you.

191
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,979
Me, too-- this is a hospital.

192
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,364
If you want to smoke,

193
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,441
go do it in the stairwell
with the doctors.

194
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,987
I'll miss you so much.

195
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,452
-Leave me Jub-Jub.
-Fine.

196
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,464
At least you still smoke.

197
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,248
I hate it when you and Selma fight.

198
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,546
Me, too.
I also hate it when they agree.

199
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,090
Homer, please be nice.

200
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,383
Patty's our guest.

201
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,836
For how long?
Where's she gonna sleep?

202
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:36,886
On our couch.

203
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,139
That's where we do our couch gags!

204
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,311
See?

205
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,729
Oh, fine.
She'll stay with the baby.

206
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,563
Well, Magster, it looks like

207
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,305
you and I are going to be cellmates.

208
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,567
(chuckles)

209
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,153
(chittering)

210
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,401
(screams)

211
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,948
Nature! Shoo! Shoo!

212
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,451
I've got a hot curling iron!

213
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,492
Hold this.
(grunts)

214
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,794
Oh, Marge, the kids are all asleep

215
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,633
and the dog's been walked.

216
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,248
There's only one thing left to do.

217
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,746
(sexy purr)

218
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,007
Did you turn the security alarm on?

219
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,090
It's still broken.

220
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,425
Ooh, well, then come here, you.

221
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,972
(Patty snoring)

222
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,715
(shouts)
What the hell was that?!

223
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,307
It's just my sister snoring.

224
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,642
She has a very fatty septum.

225
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,437
But it doesn't have to ruin our fun.

226
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,112
(snoring continues)

227
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,900
(both moaning)

228
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,321
(gasps, coughs)

229
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,115
(owl hooting)

230
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,590
-(snoring)
-(music playing intermittently)

231
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,806
Okay, which one of you kids
knows how to drive?

232
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,607
And which is sober?

233
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,532
Whew, thank God for Designated Dorothy.

234
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,111
(engine starts, truck backfires)

235
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,673
All right, everybody go to bed.

236
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,881
Those of you who got
to get up early,

237
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,091
sleep on top of the pile.

238
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,382
Hey, Brandine!

239
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,546
I caught us a possum!

240
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,934
You want to name it
before we eat it or after?

241
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:44,933
During!

242
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,564
Beauregard, you've been promoted

243
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,811
from guarding my family
to guarding this possum.

244
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,064
{\an8}That's a good dog.

245
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,073
Hmm.

246
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,697
Hey, baby.

247
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,254
How about that rain check
for last night?

248
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,409
-PATTY: Aah!
-Aah!

249
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,917
Aah, don't look at me!

250
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,378
-But you're everywhere! (gasping)
-Freak!

251
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,839
-(Homer shouts)
-Don't you ever knock?

252
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,749
-(groans)
-Get out of here! Go away!

253
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,167
(sighs) Thank God I'm blind.

254
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,716
Yo, I'm next.

255
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,880
No!

256
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,717
Whoa! What the hell?

257
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,433
I did that with love, boy.

258
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,893
What's all the hubbub?

259
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,772
-Oh, thank you, Dad.
-It's okay, son.

260
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,769
-Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-It's okay, it's okay.

261
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,061
No, really,
thank you, thank you, thank you!

262
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,935
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

263
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,232
All right, already!

264
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,105
Just take your shower.

265
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,946
I need someone to talk to.

266
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,369
Thank God I've got a past
full of lonely men to draw from.

267
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,042
Mm-hmm.

268
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,158
Disco Stu is over you.

269
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,214
Oh, Disco Stu needs a Zoloft or two.

270
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,753
(grunts)

271
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,337
Who am I kidding?

272
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,261
The one I should be talking to

273
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,630
is the one who's always
been there for me...

274
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,387
my cigarette.

275
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,799
Forget about your sister.

276
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,427
You've got me.

277
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,314
For the rest of your life,
I'll be the first thing

278
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,141
you think about every morning.

279
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:17,306
And the last thing you do every night.

280
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,568
Hmm,
looks like I have a choice to make.

281
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,361
-(grunting)
-CIGARETTE: Oh!

282
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,114
I'm in your hair! (laughs)

283
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,996
Uh...
(clears throat)

284
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,868
Listen, about this morning,

285
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,666
I'm sorry I walked in on you!

286
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,670
(grumbling)

287
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,882
Oh! Oh, yeah.

288
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,463
I'm about to say something

289
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,508
I never thought I'd say to you--
something nice.

290
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,093
-Hmm?
-(sighs)

291
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,637
I only mock you because I'm jealous

292
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,642
of what Marge has in you.

293
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,644
I only have Selma.

294
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,646
And now I don't even have that.

295
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,359
(sighs)

296
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,689
Oh, Patty, I've waited so long

297
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,994
for you to open a window of niceness.

298
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,148
(grunts)
That was it!

299
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,196
Window shut!

300
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,909
(doorbell rings)

301
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,830
Ah, what the heck!

302
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,001
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

303
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,498
Aah... (sighs)

304
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,831
What are you doing here?

305
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,337
Apologizing.

306
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,338
And I want you to know
I quit smoking for good.

307
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,262
You quit for me?

308
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,721
I quit for us.

309
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,010
Hmm, that's actually more selfish,

310
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,184
but it sounds really nice.

311
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,773
(both grunting)

312
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,388
Okay, Maggie, throw the ball to me.

313
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,595
Throw the ball.

314
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,686
Okay, how about I throw the ball?

315
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,522
It's okay.

316
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,777
You'll learn to do things
after you're a baby.

I had to do some things

You said it was for real this time.

00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,627
Disco Stu is back on Tinder.

358
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,665
(door closes)

359
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,387
It's nice to be back.

360
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,798
Since I've stopped smoking,

361
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,967
my sense of smell
has really come back.

362
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,425
Uh-huh.

363
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,925
Who knew a small apartment
with two women,

364
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,308
a baby, and an iguana
would smell so bad?

365
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,516
(both sniffing)

366
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,527
-Cigarette?
-Yes!

367
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,945
(sighs)

368
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,120
Here's to smoking and you.

369
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,199
Two things
that'll always be in my heart.

370
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,792
Is this a happy ending?

371
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,332
It's edgy.

372
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,585
<i>♪ Together forever and never to part ♪</i>

373
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,799
<i>♪ Together forever, we two ♪</i>

374
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,104
{\an8}(squealing)

375
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,607
{\an8}(squealing)

376
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,980
(squawks)

377
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,738
Hoppy, you're back!

378
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,239
(imitating Cletus)
Hey, Brandine!

379
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,821
Put out the fancy possum china!

380
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,657
I've heard of wanting a cracker,
but becoming one-- oh, no!

381
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,251
{\an8}("The Simpsons Theme"
by Yo-Yo Ma playing)

382
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,174
-(crowd murmuring)
-Shh!
