1
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,042
Come on, Maggie.

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,012
Hi. Sorry we're late.

3
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,715
This is Maggie.
We're here for our first day.

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:18,185
Hello, Maggie.
And who will be picking her up?

5
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:21,054
After she falls down?

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,056
No, at the end of the day.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,925
Wait, I don't stay with her?

8
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,294
Research shows
pre-toddlers learn best

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,229
in a parent-free environment.

10
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:32,065
Unless you want to stunt
her growth, which is great.

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,234
We're not supposed to judge.

12
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,236
No, no, it's not that.

13
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,739
I just don't want Maggie
to feel abandoned.

14
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,577
So, we'll see you at 4:00.

15
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:46,079
Okay, then.

16
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,150
Now what will I do
with the rest of my day?

17
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,420
I know.
I'll ask my favorite mommy blog.

18
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,425
Now turn that resistance
all the way up!

19
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:02,062
Come on! I want to see
you bitches suffer!

20
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,933
Am I the only one
who heard that?

21
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,267
I love it.

22
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,937
It's like being coached
by the voice inside my head.

23
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,574
Spin yourselves to death,
you land manatees!

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,017
Paint harder,
you sausage-fingered no-talents!

25
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,089
Sex-prise
your man at work.

26
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,792
What are you doing here?

27
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:36,430
Maybe you could give me
a safety inspection.

28
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,032
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

29
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,301
I'm so sex-prised!

30
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,037
There's security
cameras everywhere,

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,807
so we'll have to
snuggle under the desk.

32
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,976
On top of the desk, please.

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,246
Thanks, Jerry!
Nice. Real cool.

34
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:57,384
Now how do I fill the day?

35
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,052
What's Well Plus Good?

36
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,420
It's pronounced Well and Good.

37
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,190
Why is everyone
talking to me?

38
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,192
Well, if all these people
want to work here,

39
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,260
maybe I want to work here.

40
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,931
All right, go to tablet seven

41
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,600
to take your pre-application
ethics assessment.

42
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,035
Cool hair, by the way.

43
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:18,105
You think that my hair is cool?

44
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,874
Well, thank you, Lauren.

45
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,877
Oh, by the way,
your name tag is upside down.

46
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,445
Thank you.

47
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,681
You're the only person
to mention that.

48
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:39,226
Ooh, major mom vibes.
She's perfect.

49
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,229
I always never lie.

50
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,099
Two.
I sometimes always never lie.

51
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,870
If I never found a wallet,
I would always give it back.

52
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,105
What color is the wallet?

53
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,075
Marge Simpson.
There was never a test.

54
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,044
Except there always was.

55
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,880
- There wasn't?
- And you passed.

56
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,315
Welcome to
the Well and Good family.

57
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,152
The rest of you can go.
Your résumés will be deleted.

58
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,856
I'm the only one you hired?

59
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,726
You're the only one
we partnered with.

60
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,731
Okay, so I work here now.

61
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,700
I never asked what we sell.

62
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,068
I can figure this out.

63
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:25,706
Candy? Bath bombs?
Blowtorches?

64
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,108
$30 bottles of soda?

65
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,376
Excuse me.

66
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,212
Do you recommend
the tincture or the oil?

67
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,549
The tincture
is more expensive, I guess.

68
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,718
Look, this is about you.

69
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,587
And taking care of you.
I think.

70
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:44,224
So you have
to put yourself... first?

71
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,060
Well, your no-frills,
fumbling sales pitch

72
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,030
has won me over.
I'll take both. Yes...

73
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,266
Wow, girl, you just made
a hundred-dollar sale.

74
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,102
You're gonna fit in great here.

75
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,305
Thing is, what does here sell?

76
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,307
Is this what RadioShack is now?

77
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,076
No. We're a high-end
cannabis boutique.

78
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,145
You sell pot?!

79
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,646
Technically, I check ID's.

80
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,215
You sell pot.

81
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,153
I'm a drugs dealer!

82
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,922
Cannabis is legal
in this state now.

83
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,657
Well, so is water-skiing,

84
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,826
but that doesn't mean
I have to sell it!

85
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,661
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,064
Marge, don't leave, seriously.

87
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,599
Like, I'm asking.

88
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:30,070
Drederick Tatum!
I own your countertop grill.

89
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,005
Oh, take care not to use
metal utensils

90
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,440
on the non-stick surfaces.

91
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,109
But anyway, after
my boxing career ended,

92
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,444
I was in a lot of pain.

93
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,179
Specifically,
in my punching hands

94
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,614
and my blocking face.

95
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,183
But following a regimen
of CBD oil

96
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,685
and medicinal hits
from a Pikachu bong,

97
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,954
I was able to enjoy life again.

98
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,224
Which inspired me to create
Well and Good Healing Emporiums.

99
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,195
But pot is for Cheeches...
and Chongs.

100
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,630
Marge, it's not about
getting high.

101
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,031
It's about wellness.

102
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,001
And that's why I've hand-picked
the perfect team here.

103
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,402
I'm an expert in cannabinoids

104
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,404
and cutting-edge
delivery systems,

105
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,007
aka infusers, decarboxylators,

106
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,309
transdermals
and pet suppositories.

107
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,244
And I'm super hot.

108
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,979
And what do you need me for?

109
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,648
Marge, people know
you want to help them,

110
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,049
that it's safe here.

111
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,051
Not some place
for Cheeches and Chongs,

112
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,486
as you so recently put it.

113
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:22,856
I'm sorry.
I don't think this is really me.

114
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,492
Good luck with your lifestyle.

115
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:28,895
Oh, it's a shame there's no drug
for hurt feelings.

116
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,964
Oh, wait, there totally is.

117
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,705
You know, in some families,

118
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,841
they go around the table
and everyone says

119
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,876
one thing they learned that day.

120
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,745
Okay. I learned that.

121
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,515
Well, I learned that
the former heavyweight champion

122
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,084
of the world
owns a marijuana store.

123
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,353
And he offered me a job,
which I turned down.

124
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,554
Wait, what?

125
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,890
I mean, the people
were really cool,

126
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,558
and they thought I was cool,

127
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,994
which made me feel stoked.

128
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:05,065
But I'm not going to be
a reefer saleslady.

129
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,033
Well, I guess there's nothing
wrong with it.

130
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,836
Cannabis is legal in this state.

131
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,504
Yeah, it's basically
the same thing

132
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,006
as working in a liquor store.

133
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,675
You can work in a liquor store?

134
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,078
Stay with us, big guy.

135
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,015
I thought you'd be
opposed to it.

136
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,017
People are stressed out
these days.

137
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,187
Scurvy is back,
there's, like, 60 wars going on.

138
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,757
Whales are eating
our precious ocean plastic.

139
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,360
Maybe people want
to smoke a doob for that.

140
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,096
Oh, yeah, everyone's
selling crap to stoners now.

141
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,598
Have you seen the new
Krusty Burger commercial?

142
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:44,604
When you've got the munchies,
for some reason...

143
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,941
wink, wink,
you crave weird.

144
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,110
A deep-fried rib-wich

145
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,012
served on a warm doughnut.

146
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,781
Or a spaghetti-filled
grilled cheese sandwich

147
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,117
drizzled with ranch pudding.

148
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:02,022
Krusty's Munchie Mouthfuls.
It's high time you tried it.

149
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,959
Get it? Get it?!

150
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,027
Get it?

151
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,396
I get it.

152
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:13,033
Well, Mr. Tatum
did personally choose me.

153
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,801
He said I was helpful.

154
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:18,004
Honey, you're the most
helpful person I've ever met.

155
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,907
Now go sell the safe
legal drugs

156
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,177
our kids should never, ever use!

157
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,812
Especially Bart!

158
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,020
Is this an Apple store?

159
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,022
Everyone keeps asking that.

160
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,491
I dropped my phone
because of my arthritis.

161
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,026
We can't fix your phone,

162
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,829
but I can sure help
with that arthritis.

163
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:46,866
Try this amazing
pain-relieving lotion.

164
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,002
It tingles.

165
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,671
Not like Jergens.
I hate Jergens!

166
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:55,842
You seem stressed.

167
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,511
Why not try some yummy gummies?

168
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:04,117
Marge, thank you.
When Mother's happy, I'm happy.

169
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,019
Or at least,
much less miserable.

170
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,488
This big shot here
is the principal

171
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,991
of a whole school!

172
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,126
Show her your key ring.

173
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,132
Oh, I love it.

174
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,338
I want to buy some pot.

175
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,974
All right,
pump the brakes, Jhorts.

176
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,143
Got to ask
a few questions first.

177
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,879
Now, do you want a body high

178
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,315
or a front-of-the-face buzz?

179
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,050
I don't know.
Just hook me up.

180
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:41,021
I have the perfect strain
in mind.

181
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,555
But be warned, boo,

182
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,858
the couch-lock is strong
on this one,

183
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,360
but there's, like,
zero mind-race.

184
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,763
What are you saying?
I just want...

185
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:50,930
weed.

186
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,900
Okay, almost there.
Almost there. Now listen.

187
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,368
Do you want this in flower...

188
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,203
shatter, topical...

189
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,072
edible, nasal mist...

190
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,175
- ear drops?
- Look, I just want to score a bag of shwag

191
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,311
from some dude who may
or may not be a cop.

192
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,713
I'm a cop.

193
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,481
Have you tried this?

194
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,450
Nothing makes sense anymore!

195
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,988
Give me a beer.

196
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,462
It doesn't make my hair
smell like anything!

197
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,032
I dreamed my whole life
of legalized weed.

198
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,134
Turns out it's a real buzzkill.

199
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,569
Ain't that the truth?

200
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:30,970
Times have changed.

201
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:34,207
The romance of alcohol
is fading into the past.

202
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,544
Stoners will never know the joy
of sitting on the toilet

203
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,412
and barfing into
your own underwear.

204
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,482
Or picking a fight with a guy
twice your size

205
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,051
because his leg
touched your car.

206
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,053
Yeah. I miss the old days too.

207
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,890
When buying pot was scuzzy.

208
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,160
I'd pay anything
to turn back that clock.

209
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,595
You know what'd be popular?

210
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,230
If one of those legal places

211
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,065
made it feel like
you were scoring weed

212
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,001
from your old-school
pot connection.

213
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,204
That's a great idea,
and we should do it.

214
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,005
Those tie-dyed bong monkeys

215
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,842
will cough up big-time
for the full dirtbag shebang!

216
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,678
I'll alert the bong monkeys.

217
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,016
Afternoon, gernts.
You need some suds?

218
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,454
Duffman knows it's always time
for a refreshing Duff!

219
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,022
Yeah, that being said,

220
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,392
sometimes Barry is looking
for a little herbal refreshment.

221
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,560
Know what I mean?

222
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,796
Right this way, fellas.

223
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,902
So you guys friends of Moe?

224
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,805
Yeah. These guys are cool.

225
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:42,142
Whoa, tight.
Come on in, gentlemen.

226
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,411
Oh, wait.
Here's a disclaimer, man.

227
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,880
This is a legal dispensary,

228
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,248
compliant with all laws
and statutes.

229
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,449
As part of the experience,

230
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,251
cast members may pretend
it's illegal.

231
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,219
All right. Shall we?

232
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,789
Crazy bird,
rusty free weights,

233
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,392
everything smells like
a damp swimsuit...

234
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,027
I'm home.

235
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,662
Who are you supposed to be?

236
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,331
I'm the weird friend
who never acknowledges you.

237
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,068
I was that guy
for my old roommate Scott.

238
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,544
Just stick it
in the Band-Aid can.

239
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,346
It's all stems and seeds.

240
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,681
Thank you.

241
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,269
So, with the success
of the Well and Good brand...

242
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,071
which, you know, thank God...

243
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm so pleased to present
our latest venture...

244
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,743
Werk.

245
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,145
This is The Drederick.

246
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,915
It's a fully realized
cannabis resort and spa.

247
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,650
Now, for our launch event,

248
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,920
we'll be inviting marijuana
influencers from Dave Chapelle

249
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,023
to Harrison Ford, who is
flying himself, by the way,

250
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,192
so you know, fingers crossed.

251
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,694
Marge, I was thinking
that you would be

252
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,395
the hostess
of this launch party,

253
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,233
acting as the de facto face
of the Well and Good brand.

254
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,069
Oh, my God. Why me?

255
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,570
Well, Marge,
'cause people trust you.

256
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,839
Also, my face
is the intellectual property

257
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,075
of the artist
who created this tattoo.

258
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,576
So, you know, I'm out.

259
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,745
Oh, I'd love to.

260
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,180
This is so exciting, I...

261
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,515
Wait, wait, no.
I wanted to ask you.

262
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,419
But unfortunately, there was
a fly in the CBD ointment.

263
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:37,123
Your husband Homer
is selling weed, Marge.

264
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,126
That's terrible.

265
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,629
Wait, no, so am I.
We all are.

266
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,431
We are trying to elevate
the image of cannabis.

267
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,935
This is what he's doing.

268
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,805
Oh, he knows how much
self-esteem I get

269
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,207
from selling bud.

270
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,209
And that's our good frisbee.

271
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,212
I'm afraid that you cannot
continue with this company

272
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,583
while your husband is taking pot
back to the dark ages of 2018.

273
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,685
- I'm very sorry.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

274
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,487
Please, please don't fire me.

275
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,422
I want to be your face.

276
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,991
When Homer realizes
how much this is hurting me,

277
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,927
I'm sure he'll understand.

278
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,829
I don't understand.

279
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,265
We're doing the same thing,
except you dress like a doctor,

280
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,035
and I dress like a cool toddler.

281
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,269
Don't you get it?

282
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,439
I'm a healer,
and you're a dealer.

283
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,007
You need to quit.

284
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:31,678
I can quit whenever I want.
I just don't want to.

285
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,680
What happened to the quitter
I married?

286
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,415
I quit quitting!

287
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,551
- What's going on?
- Mom and Dad are having a drug war.

288
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,020
- It's not different!
- And you spent $1,000...

289
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,255
I make CNN much funnier!

290
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,861
Homer wouldn't quit.

291
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,365
Here's my smock,
my key to the hash register,

292
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,735
my business card
reading associate.

293
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,104
Instead of being
the face of the company,

294
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,473
my face will just be me.

295
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,543
Wait, Marge. There is one way
to save your job,

296
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,012
but it would entail the betrayal
of your husband,

297
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,816
which I would never
ask you to do.

298
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,585
Well, I mean,
it doesn't hurt to ask.

299
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:16,189
With your help, we can get
the government to shut him down.

300
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,524
The FBI? The DEA?

301
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,993
The County Health Department.

302
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,898
I don't understand.
What crime is Homer committing?

303
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,200
Pot's legal.

304
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,435
Yes, but he isn't
licensed to serve

305
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:33,239
non-psychotropic edibles,
aka food.

306
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,575
If he offers snacks
to his customers and they eat

307
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,879
even one bite,
we go in and take him down.

308
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:44,050
So we need you to bait the trap
with these.

309
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,551
Are you in?

310
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,123
Nailed it.

311
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,725
You're the son I never had.

312
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,461
Hey, Homer.
Look who's stopped by over here.

313
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,698
I am so sorry
about our little tiff.

314
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:03,069
Will you accept this apology
gift for you and your friends?

315
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,638
Oh, honey.
You're always in my corner.

316
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,206
I have the most loving,

317
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,042
supportive, loyal wife
in the world.

318
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,889
If Simpson keeps
eating like this,

319
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,758
he'll hit bottom dust
before anyone takes the bait.

320
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:29,395
Come on, you fat bastard, offer
the customer some cheese balls.

321
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:35,168
And the whole floor

322
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,936
is an air hockey table,

323
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:40,173
so moving furniture...

324
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,941
is like...

325
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,176
Homer!

326
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,179
Give your friends
some cheese balls.

327
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,381
Would anyone care to partake?

328
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,855
Code Orange. Go, go, go!

329
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,857
Stop eating!

330
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,793
Health Department.
This is a raid.

331
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,295
We got to get rid of the stuff.

332
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,067
Oh, no! Come on!

333
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,068
Oh, God!

334
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,076
We got everything we need.

335
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,978
You're shut down, pal.

336
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,651
You, you knew.

337
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,887
- You...
- Set you up.

338
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:32,558
You're coming with us, scumbag,
to pay a $25 fine.

339
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,003
Marge, darling,
everything is so perfect.

340
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,872
I hope your husband
wasn't too upset

341
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,040
about the, you know,
the treachery.

342
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:52,044
Oh, well, Homer is very
easygoing, so...

343
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,680
Excuse me,
can any of these oils or goos

344
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,250
help me with a knife wound?

345
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,987
I have been stabbed,
in the back!

346
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,323
How did you get in?
This is by invitation only.

347
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,726
I said I was
Kevin Smith's father.

348
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,028
No one questioned me.

349
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,531
Homer, control yourself.

350
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,533
You're upsetting
the influencers.

351
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,535
They're very easily influenced.

352
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:19,071
That guy is on alcohol.

353
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,073
Please don't ruin this.

354
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,343
This is cannabinoid health,
and I am its face.

355
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,513
Cabana boy health.

356
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,082
If it's so good for you...

357
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,886
why have you never
tried pot, ever?

358
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,093
Well, does a doctor
need to try insulin

359
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,096
to know that it helps diabetes?

360
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,599
Yes. I think she should.

361
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,501
Surprise! The doctor's a woman.

362
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,069
Sexist!

363
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,238
- Good point.
- That is sexist.

364
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,241
Look, I don't have
a problem with pot.

365
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,243
I can start any time I want.

366
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,245
I'll do some right now.

367
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,347
Perfect. Serenity.

368
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,220
See? Nothing.

369
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,023
I'm probably one of those people
it doesn't work on.

370
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,858
I feel like I'm on an elevator

371
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,862
that's going up and down
at the same time.

372
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,565
Something's wrong. You said
this was about wellness,

373
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,401
but I feel high.

374
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,403
Okay, okay, listen.

375
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,741
What you need to understand
is this, I'm high too!

376
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,679
I'm Serenityed out of my gourd.

377
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,484
Yeah, baby.

378
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,821
I've got to come down.
I've got to eat something.

379
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,191
That was
a chicken pot pot pie.

380
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,860
Oh, no. I ate an eatable.

381
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,696
And you just wiped your mouth
with a Hash-nap,

382
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,498
the most potent thing here.

383
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,035
Is this how I always walk?

384
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,871
What do I do with my arms?
Okay, got it.

385
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,072
This is normal.

386
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,916
Honey, it's me.

387
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,119
Homie.

388
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,121
You're gonna be okay.

389
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:19,291
In two hours
that will seem like 12.

390
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,794
You're so sweet.

391
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,130
And I ratted you out.

392
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,965
No, I get it.

393
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,967
You found a place
that made you feel special,

394
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,468
and you didn't want
to lose that.

395
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,971
I still feel weird.

396
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,206
Maybe you'd feel less weird
if I were weird too.

397
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,143
Here, I'll smoke
one of your futuristic joints.

398
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,644
That's not a doobie!

399
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,924
Oh, man, Dad, what did you do?

400
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,062
Hemp clothes burns like paper!

401
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,931
All wrong, all wrong, all wrong!

402
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,708
- Oops.
- Be cool.

403
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,043
Cheer up, neck face.

404
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,547
If there's one thing I know,
it's life is nothing but pain.

405
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,048
People will always need guys

406
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,718
like you and me
to get them wasted.

407
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,220
Yeah, thanks,
monster man hallucination.

408
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,622
Your words are
a great comfort to me.

409
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:28,294
We'll get through it somehow.

410
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,130
Well, can I come with...

411
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,910
In reaction to the destructive
Drederick blaze

412
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,113
which also destroyed the
Sign Language Monkey Sanctuary,

413
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,714
the town council has passed
an emergency ordinance

414
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,150
outlawing the sale of cannabis.

415
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,785
Without that tax money,

416
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:56,122
Maggie's pre-education center
will have to close.

417
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,624
Aw, man, they were
teaching her Mandarin.

418
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,061
Well, it's probably
for the best.

419
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,163
Even though they say
something's not addictive,

420
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,465
you can still get hooked.

421
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,103
And you don't want that.
