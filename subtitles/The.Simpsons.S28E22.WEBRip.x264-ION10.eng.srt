00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,105
{\an8}than the life of this
Greyhound station inhabitant.

175
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,740
Look at me, I'm a big man.

176
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,072
A big man!

177
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,447
Anybody got a quarter?

178
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,543
Got to be a quarter,
not two dimes and a nickel.

179
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,948
That ain't worth jack.

180
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,156
What's your take on all this,
Anger Watkins?

181
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,457
I'm angrier than a beehive
in a paint mixer.

182
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:43,342
{\an8}This is the craziest legal decision
ever made outside of Arizona.

183
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,421
What's next? Cats get credit cards?

184
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,676
Let a snail race in the Indy 500?

185
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,888
(whispers) Like that stupid movie <i>Turbo?</i>

186
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,559
I tried to inhale nitrous oxide
to get fast.

187
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,518
I ended up naked
behind an appliance store!

188
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,480
Lies! Lies! Lies!

189
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,813
{\an8}Oh, you're gonna get
ten walks a day, boy.

190
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,818
(quietly) You can even bite the mailman.

191
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,230
(whines happily)

192
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,650
There he is.

193
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,157
America's number one doggy daddy.

194
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,619
{\an8}-Would you care to do the honors?
-Would I!

195
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,790
{\an8}Uh, that's what I asked.

196
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,499
{\an8}Would you?

197
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,365
-(shutter clicks)
-You're the greatest man

198
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,957
I know one thing about!

199
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,172
-(cheering)
-(horns honking)

200
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,013
Look at all those voters.

201
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,011
What is our current position on dogs?

202
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,893
We currently have a city employee

203
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,970
who rounds them up
and puts them to sleep.

204
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,966
What? I can't believe such a jerk

205
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,978
would even be elected dog catcher.

206
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,690
From this point forth,
this town will be known

207
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,231
as the dog-loving capital of the world.

208
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,025
That'll put Springfield on the map.

209
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,528
Yeah, why aren't we on the map?

210
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,820
I don't know.
I made, like, 20 calls to Rand McNally.

211
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,775
They don't even know what state we're in.

212
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,325
Thanks to these hastily-passed
untested pandering laws,

213
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,160
Springfield is now
the most dog-friendly city in America.

214
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,618
(crowd cheers)

215
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,377
Er, uh, arf.

216
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,143
♪ ♪

217
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,486
(gasps)

218
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,456
Is there anything here
the dogs haven't gotten into?

219
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,080
Just the dog food.

220
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,166
Why are you shutting me down?

221
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,672
You made a dog wait for a teeth cleaning

222
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,264
while you saved a racehorse's life?

223
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,430
And you call yourself a veterinarian. Ha.

224
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,180
And you know what we found inside?

225
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,562
Dogs in cages.

226
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,718
That's no way to treat man's best friend.

227
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,937
Lock him up. In a cage. Like a dog.

228
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,399
Don't you understand?

229
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,858
Dogs are born to follow and obey.

230
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,729
The moment the pack realizes

231
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,186
that humans are no longer their masters,

232
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,107
thousands of years
of domestication will fall away.

233
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,027
They'll revert to their wild wolf nature.

234
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:22,037
Well, then I guess you'll be happy
being nice and safe in jail.

235
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,541
Oh, yes, please! Take me there now.

236
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,254
You're all doomed!

237
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,214
Doomed.

238
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,799
Santa's Little Helper
didn't come home last night.

239
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,261
If you were a dog these days,
would you come home?

240
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,892
It's like doggy heaven out there,
only real.

241
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,719
-Doggy heaven isn't real?
-No! No, it's real!

242
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,765
The dogs all have harps and wings.

243
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,849
How do they play harps
if they don't have fingers?

244
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,024
Um... dogs have fingers in heaven.

245
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,983
How do you know so much about dog heaven?

246
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,524
I died for five minutes
and was sent there by mistake.

247
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,148
-Now leave me alone.
-(whining)

248
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,450
Hmm...

249
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,951
Ooh! Come on, girl.

250
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,293
Ow! Ow, ow. Just get him by the collar.

251
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,699
You can do it.
Come on, don't bite me.

252
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,618
Come on. Pull. Come on.

253
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,786
Dad, we don't have time for this.

254
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,745
Quiet. I'm doing something important.

255
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,835
There you go. Yes, that's it!

256
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,091
Well, well, well,

257
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,803
look what the cat dragged in.

258
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,974
-Worth it.
-Totally worth it.

259
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,143
I know.

260
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,641
(dogs barking)

261
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,352
(barking continues)

262
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,234
{\an8}Kirk, Taquito is digging up my dahlias.

263
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,573
{\an8}-Stop him.
-Mm.

264
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,069
{\an8}-Sorry.
-(growling)

265
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,701
{\an8}(gasps) Please don't hurt me.
I'm exposing my belly.

266
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,489
{\an8}See? Exposing. Exposing! (gasping)

267
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,533
(growling)

268
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,237
(dogs snarling)

269
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,075
(growling)

270
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,755
(howls)

271
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,642
(chuckles) See ya later, Moe!

272
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,429
Huh? My car's not starting.

273
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,686
Oh, I see the problem.

274
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,978
Out of gas.

275
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,691
Well, probably safer to walk anyway.

276
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,188
Yep, nothing safer than walking.

277
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,147
This is so healthy.

278
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,357
Thanks to this walk,
I'll live a lot longer.

279
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,698
(dramatic music plays)

280
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,620
(dogs growling)

281
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,576
Hey, here come some
of my four-footed friends.

282
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,837
I guess you want to meet the guy
who's responsible

283
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,549
for making all your lives better.

284
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,129
(dogs growling)

285
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,134
Okay, wait a minute. Let me guess.

286
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,426
Collie, dachshund, Tibetan Mastiff,

287
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,550
otterhound, Swedish Vallhund,

288
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,807
Finnish Spitz, Norwegian Lundehund,

289
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,890
Catahoula Leopard Dog, Lagotto Romagnolo,

290
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,306
and three wolves!

291
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,314
(shrieks)

292
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,476
Stand back! Back!

293
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,485
-Ow! Oh!
-(snarling)

294
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,489
You don't scare me.
Your bark is worse than your bite.

295
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,072
(barking)

296
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,987
Oh, those horrible barks!

297
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,695
{\an8}(Homer whimpering)

298
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,947
{\an8}(dogs barking)

299
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,918
{\an8}(yipping)

300
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,288
Dr. Budgie warned them.
Dr. Budgie warned all of them.

301
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,336
But did they listen to Dr. Budgie?

302
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,880
All right, that's it. I'm comin' in there!

303
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,764
Oh, for cryin' out... (sighs)

304
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,431
Maybe if I turn sideways.

305
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,010
(grunts) Lou, get the bar butter!

306
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,885
This is what happens
when you buy European prison cells.

307
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,444
-(gasps)
-(growling)

308
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,439
Kids, lower the Purge armor!

309
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,112
-We don't have any Purge armor.
-Oh, right.

310
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,821
I always mean to buy it the day after
the Purge, when it's cheaper.

311
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,152
-What happened?
-The dogs have gone savage!

312
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,778
They've taken over the town!

313
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,994
-(howling in distance)
-(whines)

314
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,624
(gasps) No, boy.
Resist the call of the wild.

315
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,121
Like I did when they assigned
that book for summer reading.

316
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,044
Somebody help! Stop him!

317
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,002
(laughing)

318
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,174
(grunts) D'oh!

319
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,263
Oh, we've lost him to the pack.

320
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,429
No, he's a good dog.
He'd never turn against us.

321
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,549
Hmm, he's ripping the stuffing
out of your car seats.

322
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,887
Oh, yeah?! You think you're so smart?!

323
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,983
Okay! I'm eating your dog food!

324
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,939
This is on you!

325
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,859
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

326
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,692
(howling)

327
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,738
Hmm. Not one student showed up to school

328
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,834
just because a pack of ferocious,

329
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,499
masterless dogs
are roaming the playground.

330
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,619
-(gunfire)
-GIL: Ow! Damn it!

331
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,456
I thought we sent Willie
out there to deal with them.

332
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,672
Oh, I did. But he, uh, hasn't returned.

333
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,763
I've finally been accepted
for who I truly am.

334
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,010
(howls)

335
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,602
(grunting, snarling)

336
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,677
(dogs snarling)

337
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,675
How come I don't get a dog-proof suit?

338
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,687
Because I smell like lamb, Lou.

339
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,479
Very well.
You were right and we were wrong.

340
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,864
Yes. Um, can you remove the shackles?

341
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,362
Don't push your luck.

342
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,284
These dogs,
they walk around all high and mighty,

343
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,573
no regard for anyone else on the planet.

344
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,527
I mean, that's humans' job!

345
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,198
Repeal the stupid new laws!

346
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,157
Yes. Repeal the dog--

347
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,287
(quietly) and child labor-- laws!

348
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,044
-(crowd murmuring)
-Fine, just the dog ones.

349
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,627
-I say "status," you say...
-CROWD: Quo!

350
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,263
So passed!

351
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,470
Well, everything's back to normal again.

352
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,801
It's a pity no one told the dogs that.

353
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,637
-CROWD: Huh?
-Wha?!

354
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,562
You fools have surrendered
your position as alpha dogs.

355
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,102
Until you reassert human dominance,

356
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,106
it is you who will be calling
these savage canines master.

357
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,030
Who among you is brave enough
to tame this slobbering horde?

358
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,700
(panicked chatter)

359
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,279
(chatter dies away)

360
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,124
Well, I guess it's up to Ol' Gil.

361
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,410
Gil? Why are you helping these people
who think so little of you?

362
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,075
That's why I'm doin' it!

363
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,173
To show everyone
I'm not the town failure.

364
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,629
I thought I was the town failure!

365
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,550
-(chuckles) You're not even that.
-Aw!

366
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,720
-So who will come with me?!
-CROWD: None of us!

367
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,300
-One more time!
-CROWD: Nobody!

368
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,636
-I can't hear you!
-CROWD: Yes, you can!

369
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,515
Standing next to me

370
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,480
is the man whose life we all agreed
was worth less than a dog.

371
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,732
I say we stand behind him
as he redeems himself!

372
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,237
Even though he did nothing wrong.

373
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,648
CROWD: Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil,

374
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,237
Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil,

375
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,663
Gil, Gil!

376
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,328
We've got to get
Santa's Little Helper back.

377
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,004
(stammers) It's too dangerous!

378
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,753
-You kids ain't goin' nowhere!
-I got this.

379
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,554
(snoring)

380
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,721
Fine. But we can't go out alone.

381
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,050
We need someone who knows
how to fend off angry dogs.

382
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,387
(raving indistinctly)

383
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,312
Here, boy! Come on, boy!

384
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,141
Oh, where can he be?

385
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,976
(Cat Lady moans)

386
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,231
(creaking)

387
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,694
{\an8}(jabbering)

388
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,197
Grampa, I called to make sure
the kids are okay.

389
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,577
They're not okay!

390
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,003
The boy's got sass,

391
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,171
and the girl thinks
she's Queen of the May.

392
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,710
You leave 'em with me
and I'll straighten 'em out!

393
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,384
I did leave them with you.

394
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,303
Why the hell would you do that?!

395
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,721
-Here, boy.
-Here, boy. Here, boy.

396
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,220
(squeaking)

397
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,802
(both whimpering)

398
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,559
(gasps) It's the alpha.

399
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,390
(growling)

400
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,730
I know that dog.

401
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:48,403
It's the one Milhouse got
when he didn't wet the bed for a week.

402
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,606
(growling)

403
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,994
We're about to die at the hands of a dog!

404
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,747
Paws. Dogs have paws.

405
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,208
Just remember the last thing
you did in life was correct me.

406
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,169
Oh, that actually makes me feel better.

407
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,669
(snarling)

408
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,836
No! This has gone on long enough!

409
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,586
(yipping)

410
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,637
-You sit!
-(growling)

411
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,931
-(Marge growling)
-(growling)

412
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,981
(yipping)

413
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,690
I'm sorry!

414
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,321
Mom, you've become the alpha dog!

415
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,899
Dogs are nice. I love dogs.

416
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,065
Because, in dogs,
we see the things we wish

417
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,204
we saw more of in people--

418
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,581
lifelong friendship, unwavering loyalty,

419
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,700
and a willingness
to eat anything you cook.

420
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,248
You rang?

421
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,421
Ol' Gil's here to save the day!

422
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,290
Where are those out of control pooches?

423
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,797
Sorry, Ol' Gil, you're too late.

424
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,419
But-- But I was supposed to redeem myself

425
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,467
and finally earn the town's respect.

426
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,181
Uh, good job, Gil.

427
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,811
You had to stop at the Automat
for an egg salad sandwich.

428
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,019
Well, at least
you still have the sandwich.

429
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,890
-(growls)
-Uh... aw...

430
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,151
-Baz, you belong with the Flanders'.
-Okily-dokily.

431
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,981
Dalmatian, fire department.

432
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,026
-(barks)
-(siren wails)

433
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,200
-Mr. Burns, the hounds.
-Excellent.

434
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Uh, since you were gone,
all I had to release were the June bugs.

435
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,366
(buzzing)

436
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,581
Ah!

437
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,081
Willie, Skinner.

438
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,083
Aw, good boy.

439
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,076

00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,418

-(meows)

444
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,012
You'll have your day.

445
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,017
(meows sadly)

446
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,402
It's gonna be hard to cheer myself up
after this day.

447
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,110
-(whimpering)
-Hey, little fella!

448
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,942
You had a bad night, too, huh?

449
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,067
Come on out. I won't hurt ya.

450
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:02,371
(chuckles)
You just licked away a very bad day.

452
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,617
