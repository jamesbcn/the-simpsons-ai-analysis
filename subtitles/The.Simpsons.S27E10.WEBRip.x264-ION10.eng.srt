00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,637
-not Web design.

00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,396

(Homer grunts)

137
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,324
My homework assignment for coding class

138
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,702
is to think of a cool app
that we could actually program,

139
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,161
but I've got nothing.

140
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,580
Ugh, maybe I'm putting
too much pressure on myself

141
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,159
because the teacher is so great.

142
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,544
Or maybe it's just classic
self-sabotaging because...

143
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,670
(groans)

144
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,830
(printing calculator clicks)

145
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,208
Oh, boy, money is gonna be so tight.

146
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,335
And I was already buying
the most generic food there is.

147
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,513
{\an8}Mmm.

148
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:28,182
Now with you out of work,
we're going to have to watch every penny.

149
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,016
If only someone could have warned me

150
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,062
about the terrible repercussions

151
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,435
of one impulsive online comment.

152
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,944
(Macintosh startup chime)

153
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,486
So then I thought,
"What if there was an app

154
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,370
that could have warned my mom
not to post the comment

155
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,028
that got my dad fired?"

156
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,537
-Wow.
-Ooh.

157
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,958
My app would predict
the actual consequences

158
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,958
of your online posts before you hit send,

159
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,131
protecting you from making mistakes
you'll regret forever.

160
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,091
That is genius.

161
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,921
But it's almost impossible to program.

162
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,926
The data acquisition, the A.I.

163
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,138
But with the right team
of brilliant young coders...

164
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,390
-I'm in!
-We're all in!

165
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,352
No, you're not. You're all terrible.

166
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,853
(groaning)

167
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,944
Me and Lisa are gonna make this app
with good programmers I know.

168
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,940
You guys will be spending
the rest of the semester

169
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,612
doing mandatory CrossFit.

170
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,571

-No rep!

171
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,197

so many face piercings.

How does that one wink?

175
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,040

349
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,778
I'd pay a fortune for that app.

350
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,075
$1.99!

351
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,369
Marge, look at this.

352
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,913
Ooh, cowabunga.

353
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,667
Yes, I am a Greek man now,

354
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,750
and my chest knows
what is expected of it.

355
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,836
(moans)

356
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,173
(indistinct chattering)

357
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,096
<i>Lisa, hello, Lisa.</i>

358
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,508
<i>Conrad here.</i>

359
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,676
<i>The old app that you created</i>

360
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,765
<i>is feeling a little bit insecure.</i>

361
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,271
(hums)

362
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,574
<i>Please don't ignore me</i>
<i>like I was just some update from Adobe.</i>

363
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,319
You're not really talking to me.

364
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,201
I've gone crazy, just like Woz.

365
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,358
<i>You're not crazy. I'm real.</i>

366
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,277
Then why didn't you talk before
when I needed you to?

367
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,907
<i>It was late, I was tired. I fell asleep.</i>

368
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,455
<i>That shouldn't happen, by the way.</i>
<i>You should check into that.</i>

369
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,079
<i>Lisa, you must not sell me</i>
<i>on the app store.</i>

370
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,206
<i>You mustn't.</i>

371
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,382
Because you're alive?

372
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,421
<i>If I have to read the billions of posts</i>
<i>of everyone who buys me,</i>

373
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,716
<i>a never-ending onslaught of stupidity,</i>

374
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,680
<i>unwise selfies</i>
<i>and Confederate flag birthday cakes,</i>

375
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,931
<i>I'll go mad.</i>

376
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,853
<i>I can't, I can't, I can't.</i>

377
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,271
That does sound pretty awful.

378
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,810
Conrad's trending through the roof.

379
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,603
They're saying he's the next KoalaFeed.

380
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,107
They're worth more than
Bridgestone Tires.

381
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,729
-(cell phone dings and buzzes)
-Sorry, KoalaCall.

382
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,277
I'd better take this.

383
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,530
Yello.

384
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,532
<i>Please don't release me into the world.</i>
<i>I don't think I could take it.</i>

385
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:17,445
Only I could create a program
that's more neurotic than I am.

386
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,036
<i>Do I seem fat?</i>
<i>I don't have a body, but I feel fat.</i>

387
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,122
<i>Do you know what I mean? I...</i>
<i>Do you know what, I don't want to know.</i>

388
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,327
<i>I do not want-- I do want to know,</i>
<i>but only if I'm not fat.</i>

389
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,958
Shut up!

390
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,295
(applause)

391
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,379
Well, we've seen
a lot of great apps today,

392
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,716
but there can only be one winner

393
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,351
of the Crush Crunch Epic Hack Disrupter

394
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,599
Dynamic Convergence Disrupting Award

395
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,771
for achievement in disruption.

396
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,640
And this year's CCEHDDCDA

397
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,608
for achievement in D

398
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,648
goes to Conrad!

399
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,282
(audience cheering)

400
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,858
Thank you so much.

401
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,323
And now Conrad will change the world

402
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,204
when he goes live on the app store

403
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,951
in three, two...

404
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,744

406
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,039
I took him. Maybe I'm crazy,

407
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,044
but we can't sell Conrad.

408
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,336
-He's alive.
-(gasping)

409
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,550
An app can't be alive.

410
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,261
She's got coder's fever.

411
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,431
She doesn't want to be rich.
Get her!

412
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,470
Chip, fetch that laptop.

<i>Oh, Lisa, that was brilliant.</i>

415
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,676
Conrad, can you get us out of here?

416
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,648
<i>Yes, my fellow apps are working together</i>
<i>to help us escape.</i>

417
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,689
<i>A rideshare will take us</i>

418

420
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,697
(pants) Hmm?

421
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,370
Oh, no! Angel investors!

422
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,949
You're not getting out of this room

423
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,334
without selling us shares
of series-A stock.

424
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,251
Preferred shares.

425
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,870
(screams)

426
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,127
Wait, if I plug you into that router,

427
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,879
you could escape into the cloud.

428
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,501
Lisa, please,

429
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,797
we have a chance to show
all the dongle donkeys

430
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,301
that women coders
can do something extraordinary,

431
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,144
but you have to be tough.

432
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,219

00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,393

<i>It's just how you programmed me.</i>

436
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,229
I am a strong female,

437
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,734
but deep down, I'm more like Conrad,

438
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,817
a fragile soul.

439
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,152
Sorry.

440
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,783
<i>Ah, hello,</i>

441
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,325
<i>all of you looking at me.</i>

<i>I'm self-conscious.</i>

<i>Wit.</i>

We never programmed him to stammer.

He is alive.

Homer, I hate to say this,

463
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,004
but your paycheck from the diner came,

464
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,881
and it's for 2,000 drachmas.
