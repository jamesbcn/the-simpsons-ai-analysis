Kent Brockman reporting live
from the Springfield rail yards,

170
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,471
where Lady Gaga's
fabulous freighter

171
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,642
has bumped and grinded
its way into town.

172
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,062
Suffice it to say,
this is the most

173
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,770
culturally significant train
to stop here since

174
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,351
the McKinley funeral cortege
paused to pick up casket ice.

175
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,938
Now, sweetie, don't make
a big deal out of this.

176
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,818
I stopped reading
after "Top Student."

177
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,026
Want to honk your jazz tube?

178
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,536
Oh, what is the point?

179
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,829
I think this is the end of me.

180
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,873
All I had was my integrity.

181
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,366
And now that's gone.

182
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,048
(sobbing)
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

183
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,548
I try not to cry
till you're asleep.

184
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,512
-I appreciate that.
-(groans)

185
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,513
(sobbing) Look, if I could
just spend a few days

186
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,386
in my room without anyone
trying to cheer me up,

187
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,984
I think I might
have a chance to...

188
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,980
Hey, why don't we
go see Lady Gaga?

189
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,812
That'll turn your
frown upside down.

190
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,147
It's not a frown.
It is a straight line of resignation.

191
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,404
Looks just the same
upside down.

192
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,566
What are you talking about?
Y-You're right!

193
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,986
Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!

194
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,655
Dad, if you really want to help,
please stop trying to help.

195
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,455
I will, but you know me
and my crazy number thing

196
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,750
where I always have
to get to 17.

197
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,673
Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!
Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!

198
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,173
Voop! Voop! Voop!
Whoops, I lost count.

199
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,625
Better start again.
Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!

200
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,085
(sighs)

201
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:17,098
CROWD: Gaga-oo-la-la.
Gaga-ra-ma-ma.

202
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,851
Come on, Lisa, come on.

203
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,313
I'm sorry, I don't really
want to be here.

204
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,324
Claws up, Springfield!

205
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Never forget,
you're all my Little Monsters!

206

Uh, actually,
I'm half monster, half Armenian.

207
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,160
Pick your poison.

208
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,950
And you should love
yourself as much

209
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,413

Now, we have to get going.

00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,779

GAGA: You!

00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,201
What's wrong, honey?

252
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,955
Please, I've had enough
attention for one day!

253
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,789
Yo, lighting! I can't see the girl
who's had enough attention.

254
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,719
We should go
to your house and talk.

255
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,468
Incognito!

256
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,930
Oh, God.

257
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,967
Psst! It's me, Gaga.

258
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,635
But no one must know.

259
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,644
<i>HOODIE VOICE CHIP:</i>
<i>Gaga. Gaga. Gaga.</i>

260
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,396
So peaceful. Just the buzzing
of the paparazzi.

261
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,230
(cameras snapping)

262
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,975
Hey, Gary.
How's your wife and kids?

263
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,397
Still ashamed of me.
Big smile!

264
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,156
This is where I live.

265
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,238
Well, hello.

266
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,703
It's one of those
music industry superstars

267
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,084
who's turning our innocent children
into ladies of the night.

268
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,252
What sweater drawer
did you crawl out of?

269
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,080
(chuckles) Name's Ned Flanders.
I've heard of you.

270
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,247
Haven't seen so much skin since
shedding season on a snake farm.

271
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,916
But all I'm saying
is that everyone is beautiful...

272
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,546
Yes, but Jesus said that...

273
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,183
pretty much the same thing.

274
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,510
Darn it, the Bible said
the Devil would be attractive.

275
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,636
What makes you think
I'm the Devil?

276
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,350
Unless you're gonna slap some
wieners on those, turn 'em off.

277
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,269
Joke's on you; I needed a trim.

278
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,449
(Gaga groaning)

279
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,160
Bastards!

280
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,581
Lisa, look at me.

281
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,750
So what if your number one
supporter is you.

282
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,500
That's how it should be.

283
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,582
I had some
very tough times myself

284
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,417
before I became
a superstar at age 22.

285
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,554
Everything is gonna be fine.
You better yet?

286
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,802
-(phone chimes)
-Sorry, gotta answer this text.

287
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,345
Please, take your time.

288
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,520
You know what you need?

289
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,098
-Solitude?
-Flash mob!

290
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,524
Now, Lisa, if that didn't
fundamentally change

291
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,647
who you are,
I don't know what.

292
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,695
You idiots!
She meant we should disperse.

293
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,075
Lisa, you un-tattooed
little miracle,

294
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,246
I'm not leaving here until
I restore your sense of hope.

295
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,507
Let me explain. I have a chance
for a grim but tolerable life,

296
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,221
but only if I give up hope.

297
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,601
Now if you don't mind,
and with all due worship,

298
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,270
I would like to be alone.

299
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,098
Lady Gaga, meet your biggest
threat: Baby Googoo.

300
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,982
Can I please be alone?

301
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,487
Well, it worked once.

302
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,749
-So, any ideas about Lisa?
-(sighs)

303
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,877
I never have any idea
what to do for Lisa.

304
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,715
To be the mother of someone
who's so smart

305
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,761
and so sensitive and who
beautifully plays an instrument

306
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,387
(whispers)
I don't really care for,

307
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,814
(sobbing)
it's so hard.

308
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,311
I wish I was one of those

309
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,476
young women who could
just wave their hands

310
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,475
in front
of their eyes and not cry,

311
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,737
because it doesn't
work for me.

312
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,989
-(yells)
-Marge...

313
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,320
-(yells)
-Ah...

314
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,065
-Ooh! Aah! Ooh!
-Marge. Marge.

315
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,067
-Marge.
-Hm...

316
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,198
-Marge, take it easy.
-(groans)

317
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,825
It's just human contact.

318
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,462
I'm afraid handholding
isn't going to cheer me up.

319
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,710
Well, maybe this will.

320
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,342
Homer!

321
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,842
Wow. Wow.

322
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,514
This is like the night Hillary
won the New Hampshire Primary.

323
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,098
Lisa snuck out.

324
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,732
I'm going after her.
(Homer grunting)

325
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,518
-What are you gonna say?
-HOMER: Whoo! Mm.

326
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,693
I'll just tell her that...

327
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,862
Stop it, Homer!

328
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,610
Some of that meat is me.
Can I just trim the hem?

329
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,362
(groans) It's yours.

330
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,201
Oh, good. She's playing.

331
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,373
Not so good.
It's "Lisa Roulette."

332
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,373
(kids shouting)
Don't let her get you!

333
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,956
Her eyes shoot loser lasers!

334
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,712
(feigns gasping)

335
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,968
(chanting)
There is no over-the-top.

336
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,588
There is no over-the-top.

337
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,875
Run!

338
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,258
With an egg that big, there's
gotta be an even bigger chicken!

339
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,848
Lisa?

340
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,694
Lisa, listen to me.

341
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,900
This pity party's being shut
down by the smile police.

342
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,692
Here's what you're gonna do.

343
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,735
Why do you keep telling me
what I'm gonna do?

344
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,529
This isn't about me.

345
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,202
-Well, who else would it be about?
-You!

346
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,741
It's about
"Hello, hello, Springfield."

347
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,617
"It's me, Gaga!"

348
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,794
"Why is everyone looking
at my purple hair

349
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,543
full of bluebirds?"

350
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,303
-Well, I denounce thee!
-Wha...?

351
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,589
I denounce thee for giving people
ambitions they cannot fulfill.

352
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,434
And I denounce thee
for positing a world

353
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,889
where social acceptance
and walking on heels are easy!

354
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,471
Please, may we kill the kid?

355
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,767
I denounce thee!
I denounce thee!

356
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,271
I denounce thee!

357
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,942
Whoa, easy, little monster.

358
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,442
Don't "monster" me.

359
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,364
(all gasp)

360
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,744
Whatever you say.

361
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,109
(sobbing)

362
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,616
Are you crying... glitter?

363
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,080
Tiny diamonds.
(sobs)

364
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,950
Hurts like hell.

365
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,577
(chanting)
Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga...

366
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,006
HOMER: Okay Lisa, coming up
to make things better!

367
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,969
(grunting)
Okay, I'm almost there.

368
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,971
Upward, ever upward.

369
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,853
(panting)
Stay hydrated...

370
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,019
Oh, I'm on the wrong tree!

371
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,138
(grunts)
Okay, try again.

372
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,845
Here we go. Up again.

373
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,975
(grunting and panting)
Oh... Lisa, can you come down?

374
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,608
Sweetie, I've been thinking.

375
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,113
Now, this all started
because you used a fake name

376
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,356
to defend yourself.

377
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,118
The problem's not
that you were cheating.

378
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,408
It's that you got caught.

379
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,997
I cheat on my diet,
but nobody knows

380
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,384
'cause the damage
is on the inside,

381
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,051
and the first warning sign
is sudden death.

382
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,880
So, honey, what do you say?

383
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,875
Dad, thank you!

384
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,297
Like always, the fact
that I could tune you out

385
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,506
without fearing I'd miss out
on something

386
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,967
gave me the time
to take stock and realize

387
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,888
how ungrateful I have been.

388
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,936
Which means,
I've got a train to catch.

389
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,271
(chuckling)
Parenting.

390
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,397
It's the one job you know
you're always doing right.

391
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,316
So long, Springfield.
You are my Waterloo.

392
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,076
(crowd cheers)

393
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,748
And now I'm just going to lie
in bed and eat Fruit Roll-Ups.

394
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,409
Why is she doing in defeat
what I do in victory?

395
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,828
(whistle blowing)

396
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,336
(chugging)

397
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,249
Gaga!

398
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,257
Lisa?

399
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,588
Why are you here?

400
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,843
-To thank you.
-For what?

401
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,715
Look at me!
You did help me

402
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,262
by allowing me
to inappropriately focus

403
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,096
eight years of rage
and rejection on you.

404
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,272
It was like a great sneeze.

405
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,351
And now I can say
what's good about me.

406
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,726
And I can say it
as Lisa Simpson!

407
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,864
-(gently) Just not that loud.
-Go ahead.

408
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,861
Well, I am smart,
nice, tolerant, funny

409
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,204
but not "mean funny,"
and I never forget a birthday,

410
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,910
even for kids who move away.

411
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,700
Now, Lisa,
there's only one last thing

412
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,833
you have to do
to be a Little Monster.

413
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,160
I'll do anything but sing.

414
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,166
You are gonna sing!
