Marge, please, old people
don't need companionship.

97

They need to be
isolated and studied,

98
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,544
so it can be determined
what nutrients they have

99
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,706
that might be extracted
for our personal use.

00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,837
Oh, yes, of course.
That's what I meant, "Visa."

173
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,835
It's these new dentures.

174
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,256
(all chomping food loudly)

175
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,555
Well, I think it's wonderful
that your father

176
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,809
has fallen in
love with my mother.

177
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,351
Well, I'm opposed
to the whole thing--

178
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,814
Damn opposed!

179
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,194
He's damn opposed.
Damn, damn, damn opposed.

180
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,441
Bart!

181
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,733
Homer, what possible
reason could you have

182
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,235
against Grampa
being in love?

183
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,068
If he marries your mother, Marge,
we'll be brother and sister!

184
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,565
And then our kids,
they'll be horrible freaks

185
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,408
with pink skin, no overbites
and five fingers on each hand!

186
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,829
(screams)

187
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,665
-(line ringing)
-Hello, Mom?

188
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,841
Fine. You know Abe had
a very nice time with you last Sunday.

189
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,092
Tell her I love her!

190
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,803
Grampa, shh!
I know my mother.

191
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,593
If you come on too strong,
she's going to get scared away.

192
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,678
-I love ya.
-What?

193
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,813
Uh, I love ya, mom.

194
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,850
-I love ya. I love ya.
-I love ya. I love ya.

195
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,984
I love ya, mom.
Gotta go.

196
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,851
(doorbell rings)

197
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,475
Yeah, hi. I got a special
delivery for Homer Simpson.

198
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,648
That's me!
(groans)

199
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,026
Don't write no more
letters to Mr. Sinatra.

200
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:33,994
(doorbell rings)

201
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,986
I've got a special delivery
for Homer Simpson.

202
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,407
Uh, that's me.
(groans)

203
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,666
Stop stealing golf balls
from the driving range.

204
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,879
-(doorbell rings)
-(moans)

205
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,500
MAN: Homer Simpson,
I've got a, uh,

206
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,208
special delivery
for you.

207
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,628
Go away.

208
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,626
If you do not open
the door, Mr. Simpson,

209
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,638
I cannot give you your...
special delivery.

210
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,730
(sighs)

211
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,523
Here's your
special delivery.

212
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,274
-Thanks. (groans)
-That's for keepin' me waiting.

213
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,648
Hey, Lis, guess
who's got a genuine

214
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,446
Itchy & Scratchy
animation cel?

215
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,119
Oh! That is so cool!
That is so exciting!

216
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,278
That is so--

217
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,657
Crappy.

218
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,575
It looks like part
of Scratchy's arm.

219
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:26,793
Oh, no. I used Dad's
credit card to buy this?

220
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,456
-Yeesh! How much was it?
-$350.

221
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,086
- Ooh.
-Ha-ha!

222
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,094
-(weakly) Ha, ha, ha.
-Oh, my God.

223
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,886
This boy is having
an out-of-body experience.

224
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,350
This is very...
bad for business.

225
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,887
Hot diggity!

226
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,515
I'm gonna smooch her like
a mule eating an apple!

227
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,944
(licking, kissing noises)

228
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,944
I even bought me some
special novelty dentures.

229
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,857
{\an8}See?

230
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,065
Dad, that will never work.

231
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:02,326
If you wanna make your move,
you gotta play it cool.

232
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,501
(jazzy singsong)
Now, what you gotta do,

233
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,920
if you wanna get a kiss,

234
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,459
is act real smooth
and make your move like this.

235
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,835
-(yawns)
-Oh, I see.

236
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,085
So, if I take
your advice

237
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,547
and make your
patented move,

238
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:25,098
then my chances for love
will slightly improve.

239
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,694
(yawns)

240
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,190
(giggles)

241
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,981
Now what's that rule?

242
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,105
Play it cool.

243
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,282
(doorbell rings)

244
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,993

worth anything?

247

(sighs) Let me
show you something.

248
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,670
This-- This is a Snagglepuss
drawn by Hic Heisler.

249
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,296
It is worth something.

250
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,933
This-- This is an arm
drawn by nobody.

251
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,390
It is worth nothing.

252
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,560
Can't you give me
anything for it?

253
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,139
I can give you this telephone.
It is shaped like Mary Worth.

254
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,185

This is so nice.

I can't remember
when I felt this young.

the next dance?

Don't sneak up

No need for the blown
gasket, Charlie.

265

I'll have her back
in one piece.

I'll show him.

the frowning of a lifetime.

Oh, yes, yes, well.

278
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,138
I'd say you were
an angel, but

279
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,935
angels don't
dance like that.

Mr. Simpson, I represent
the estate of Jimmy Durante.

an immediate halt

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,180
Well, would it be
all right with you

291
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,597
if I just laid down
in the street and died?

292

would be acceptable.

{\an8}Smithers, guess what
happened to me last night?

295

I don't know, sir.

296
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,655
You had sex with that
old woman?

297
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,330
She said "no" to me.

298
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,489

I've become a billionaire.

How did you think
of that so fast?

323
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,967
I... sent it to you
on your birthday.

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,340

I have something in my eye.

by this new beau.

I feel so bad
for Grampa.

00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,482
Your "money's" happiness
is all that "moneys."

345
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,348
-(exhales)
-Hmm.

346
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,856
Hi. You know, Grandma
really likes it

347
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,730
when her boyfriends
are nice to me.

348
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,947
She especially likes it
when they give me money.

349
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,948
Run along, peewee.
Baby gets nothing.

350
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,820
Very well, you leave me
no choice.

351
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,327
This gun
is filled with ketchup.

352
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,870
This one with mustard.
Now give me $350 bucks

353
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,825
or you're gonna be a mess
for your date.

354
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,915
You don't have
the guts.

355
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,839
(growls)

356
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,842
(yells) Here.
Take your money. Take it.

357
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:53,045
Ooh! Now, the tables
have turned, haven't they?

358
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,467
GRANDMA:
Monty, I'm ready.

359
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,386
-Hmm?
-Ooh.

360
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,523
Oh, why'd she
have to leave me?

361
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,766
Hi, Abe.

362
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,068
We heard you was in need
of some cheering up.

363
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,822
{\an8}So we got you
a special cake.

364
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,074
{\an8}(woman coughing)

365
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,696
Uh-oh. Better call
the nurse.

366
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,414
Bravissimo, Luigi.

367
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,955
Bring us your
finest bottle of vino.

368
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,750
Hey, you trust Luigi.

369
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,213
He knows what for to make-a
really nice the amore.

370
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,165
Monty, I've never been to a more
romantic restaurant.

371
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,887
LUIGI: Hey, Salvatore,
break out the cheap hooch

372
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,258
for Mr. No tip and the dried-up
zombie he's-a captured.

373
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,556
Dad, I'm really sorry,
but I charged $350 on your credit card.

374
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,402
-What?
-Don't worry. Here's the cash.

375
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,069
Whoo-hoo! $350.

376
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,688
Now, I can buy
70 transcripts of Nightline.

377
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,276
-But, Dad--
-(laughs)

378
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,111
Oh, well,
he's happy.

379
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,277
I'm gonna keep this
Mary Worth phone right here.

380
00:17:55,365 --> 00:18:00,155
Her stern, but sensible face will remind
me never to do anything so stupid again.

381
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,285
(ringing)

382
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,462
<i>MILHOUSE: Hey, Bart,</i>
<i>you wanna go play</i>

383
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,001
<i>with that x-ray machine</i>
<i>in the abandoned hospital?</i>

384
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,086
Sure.

385
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,051
Now, my dear. If you
look in your champagne,

386
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,763
I think you'll find
a little surprise.

387
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,934
(slurps, gags)

388
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,984
(laughs nervously)
Not to worry.

389
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,229
I believe there's another one
around here somewhere.

390
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,021
(yells)

391
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,605
Ooh! Yes.

392
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,319
(joints cracking)
My darling,

393
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,149
since my kneecaps are filling
with fluid as we speak,

394
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,816
I'll be brief--
Will you marry me?

395
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,576
Oh! Mom, you can't marry
Mr. Burns. He's an evil man.

396
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,000
Evil, schmevil, Marge.
Monty can provide for me.

397
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Besides, he's
a great kisser.

398
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,625
Ew! Yuck!

399
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,088
Mm, what about
Abe Simpson?

400
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,339
Don't you have
any feelings for him?

401
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,011
Oh, he's a dear,

402
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,630
but he's too much
of an old fusspot.

403
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,176
We're all aware
of Grampa's problems,

404
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,561
but compared to Mr. Burns,
he's Judge freaking Reinhold.

405
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,020
I don't know
who that is.

406
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,651
Oh! Who needs her?

407
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,228
Now I'll have more time
to read things

408
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,024
I find on the ground.

409
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,776
"la-tex con-do."

410
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,784
Boy, I'd like
to live in one of those!

411
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,326

412
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,092
{\an8}(chatter)

413
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,879
Hey, Barney, why don't you
fill out the groom's side?

414
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,264
-Hey! Down in front!
-Nein!

415
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,563
(organ plays "Wedding March")

416
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,848
Where's Grampa?
Wasn't he invited?

417
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,732
{\an8}Yeah, but his
reply envelope

418
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,099
{\an8}just had a check
to the gas company in it.

419
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,227
(both groaning)

420
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,623
(camera shutters clicking)

421
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,080
And, so, when Eliphaz came down
from Mount Hebron bearing figs,

422
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,293
he offered them
to Moham,

423
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,424
who you will remember
is the father of Shecham,

424
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:16,012
and to Hazar, on the occasion
of their matrimony,

425
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,629
much in the same--

426
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,796
We've heard enough about Bliz-Blaz
and Him-Ham already.

427
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,176
Get to the bloody point!

428
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,722
(mutters)

429
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:27,175
Do you, Charles
Montgomery Burns,

430
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,437
take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

431
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
-I do.
-Oops.

432
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,566
The ring, you little imbecile,
before I really lose my temper.

433
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,611
-(growls)
-(grunts)

434
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,065
Hmm? Hmm?

435
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,315
I know. I know.

436
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,197
Ow, ow, ow!

437
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,497
Do you,
Jacqueline Bouvier,

438
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,291
take this man to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

440

How did--

442
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,178
I specifically requested
no romantic music!

443
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,339
Wha--

444
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,466
Mrs. Bouvier!

445
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,563
Mrs. Bouvier!

448
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,728
Mrs. Bouvier!

449
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,401
Honey, are you sure you wanna be
Mrs. Montgomery Burns?

450
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,361
Wouldn't you rather be
Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?

451
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,736
-No.
-(gulps)

452
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,445
I don't wanna be either.

453
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,912
Hot diggity damn!
That's good enough for me!

454
