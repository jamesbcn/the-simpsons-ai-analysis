I don't recall that.

{\an8}Ow! This is the worst pain imaginable!

41
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,693
{\an8}This one's cold.

42
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,368
{\an8}Mr. Simpson,
your injury was no accidénte,

43
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,789
{\an8}it was... negligénce.

44
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,618
{\an8}My burns have affected our...

45
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,123
{\an8}(whispers) intimacy...

46
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,495
{\an8}because all night,
I talk about how much money

47
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,462
{\an8}I'm going to make from the lawsuit.

48
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,343
{\an8}Money? What I am concerned
about is your burns.

49
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,840
{\an8}(grunts skeptically)

50
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,762
{\an8}They have healed much too quickly.

51
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,141
{\an8}Sit still while I give
your head the "third degree."

52
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,102
{\an8}(screams) Oh, God!
It hurts worse than the burns!

53
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,022
{\an8}Yes, these are special acid markers.

54
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:29,356
{\an8}Homer Simpson, you shall receive
$5,000 after legal fees.

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,940
{\an8}Pay up, Krusty.

56
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,565
{\an8}It wasn't even my place!

57
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,162
{\an8}Man, I got a bad lawyer.

58
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,833
{\an8}So, uh, what are you gonna do
with the money, Homer?

59
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,158
{\an8}Well, thought bubble Marge
said we should

60
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,084
{\an8}put it in a college fund for Lisa.

61
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,623
{\an8}So where's the money now?

62
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,116
{\an8}I put it in the bank.

63
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,707
{\an8}That place is great!
On their wall, they had a photo

64
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,134
{\an8}with an old couple walking on the beach

65
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,673
{\an8}with their pants rolled up.

66
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,586
{\an8}Uh, Homer, we all wanna walk on a beach

67
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,965
{\an8}with our pants rolled up,

68
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,511
{\an8}but, uh, banks are not as safe
as they used to be.

69
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,596
{\an8}Yeah, when you give the bank your money,

70
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,221
{\an8}they lend it to other people!

71
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,978
{\an8}I saw a <i>Sesame Street </i>about it!

72
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,769
{\an8}Kermit was wearing his
trench coat and everything.

73
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,813
{\an8}Wait, the frog in the trench coat
is Kermit, too?

74
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,568
{\an8}All the frogs on that show are Kermit.

75
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,899
Keeps all the other frog actors
out of work.

76
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,565
That settles it. No banks for me.

77
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,453
I'll tell you where
you should put your money.

78
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,030
The one safe place left in this
world of woe:

79
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,116
What the...?

80
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,161
I'm not gonna gamble
with my daughter's future.

81
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,745
Nah, you don't have to bet the money.

82
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,790
The poker website just keeps it
nice and safe,

83
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,085
where the FDIC can't get its
grubby little hands on it!

84
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,919
A poker site is now safer
than an American bank.

85
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,796
Has our nation-- built on people
suing because their onion rings

86
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,005
were too hot-- come to this?

87
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,465
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't you badmouth this country.

88
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,346
Compared to the rest of
the Third World, we're doin' great!

89
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,104
{\an8}Open file, click and...

90
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,766
{\an8}(cash register dings)

91
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,685
{\an8}...invested!

92
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,483
Hey, Lisa, check out your college fund!

93
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,776
You put my college fund on a poker site?!

94
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,491
It's a classy operation.

95
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,621
See? The little dealer's
wearing a bow tie-- cute!

96
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,278
Well, at least I have a college fund!

97
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,448
On a poker site!

98
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,285
More importantly, it's a college fund.

99
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,371
On a poker site!

100
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,705
Dad, please!

101
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,540
Sorry. Check out my new T-shirt.

102
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,263
(sighs)
Where did you get that shirt?

103
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,668
I've had it for a long time.

104
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,586
I was just about to throw it out,
and then this happened.

105
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,836
Mwah!

106
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,505
(rattling)

107
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,597
That's one way to avoid drunk driving.

108
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,353
Another way is don't drink.

109
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,104
I'm not Superman.

110
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,396
Homie, do you know what yesterday was?

111
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,860
Ha! Of course I do!

112
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,111
Happy anni... birth... entine...

113
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,114
Shark week?

114
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,736
Yesterday's the day we were
supposed to visit Grampa!

115
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,196
What the...?! Stupid calendar.

116
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,367
First you put the Fourth of July
on Sunday, and now this!

117
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,706
Oh, we're gonna discuss this later!

118
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,087
Okay, remember the plan:
Apologize to Grampa.

119
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,843
Then when he wants us
to take him out to lunch,

120
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,635
point to the leftovers,

121
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,259
tell him we already did, but he forgot.

122
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,345
I still feel guilty.

123
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,771
Your father's
not going to be around forever.

124
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,180
Marge, you take that back!

125
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,558
Fine, he'll be around forever.

126
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,895
You take that back!

127
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,860
(sighs)

128
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,574
(sighs)
We're here to see Abe Simpson.

129
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,401
Abe Simpson?! Uh, excuse me.

130
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,737
(curious grunting)

131
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,373
I'm very sorry to tell you
your father... is missing.

132
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,872
Missing?! What kind of a prison
are you people running here?

133
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,865
If it's any consolation,
we'll probably find him

134
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,167
when the river thaws in the spring.

135
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,420
A lot of bobbers then.

136
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,604
There's gotta be a clue
in here somewhere.

137
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:50,428
Spats, sock garters,
the world's hardest hard candy...

138
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,099
Oh, it's hopeless!

139
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,397
This room is like a museum
of meaningless old crap.

140
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,152
By which I mean every museum.

141
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,784
Grampa's army footlocker!

142
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,161
I bet the most important things
in the world

143
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,698
to him are in this box!

144
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,782
So precious...

145
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,461
Look at that, a man's whole life

146
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
being kicked around on the floor.

147
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,126
MARGE: "Spiro's...

148
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,172
The place that changed my life..."

149
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,005
Flimsy lead, take me away!

150
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,642
Okay, baby, let's see the flop.

151
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,392
Damn it! Lost again.

155
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,063
Are you playing poker
with my college fund?

156
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,267
I'm only down $62.

157
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,528
Not counting my tips to the waitresses.

158
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,323
Get your hands off my future!

159
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,238
Fine, fine.

160
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,116
New low, even for this family.

161
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,705
College fund on a poker site.

162
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,460
I'm just gonna log right out.

163
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,709
Get outta here!

164
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,088
Huh. Two queens.

165
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,473
That's a great start.

166
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,561
Well, maybe I can just win the $62 back.

167
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,098

00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,895
Four queens! Yes! Yes...!

169
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,189
Gambling, eh?

170
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,322
Satan's most potent recruiting tool!

171
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,069
All due respect, Mr. Flanders,
could I have a little privacy?

172
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,823
Please?

173
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,235
Thank you.

176
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,590
Time to play with house money!

177
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,261
-Or time to walk away from the table.
-Shoo!

178
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,759
How did he...?

179
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,354
Can't let Lisa lose her sense of wonder.
(grunts)

180
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,064
(dogs growling)

181
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,897
(both whimpering)

182
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,482
(patrons murmuring, laughing)

183
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,945
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

184
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,122
We don't like questions, man.

185
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,581
Yeah, but I'm just trying
to get information,

186
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,211
like a nosey reporter
or an undercover cop.

187
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,459
What'd he say about a cop?

188
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,790
Or a spy from a rival gang?

189
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,626
Hey, what are you doing?
(screaming)

190
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,633
(Homer gibbering)

191
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,465
Abe Simpson... used to work here.
Put him down!

192
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,471
Ow!

193
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,388
(sneezes)

194
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,393
Welcome to Spiro's! I am Spiro.

195
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,266
Not the Spiro on the sign.
That's my brother.

196
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,153
Did you say my dad worked here?

197
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,150
Yes, in the old days.

198
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,652
When people ate steak,
drank champagne, and the music...

199
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,985
oh, the music! I hated the music!

200
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,952
(swing music playing)

201
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,589
Hmm...

202
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:10,087
Simpson! I pay you to clean tables,
not to write songs.

203
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,594
And you, Marvin Hamlisch,

204
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,546
I pay you to write songs,
not to clean tables!

205
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,966
What can I say? I like to pitch in.

206
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,595
(Spiro speaking Greek)

207
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,556

208
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,900

210
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,570
HOMER: Wait a minute!

211
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,735
My dad was an aspiring
songwriter like Charles Manson?

212
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,366
I never knew that.

213
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,079
You know who would sound good
singing that song?

214
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,495
Me.

215
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,714
Rita Lafleur singing one of my tunes?!

216
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,214
Can a 35-year-old busboy's
life get any better?

217
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,548

222
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,935
Busboy, that breadbasket
napkin's so opened up,

223
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,483
you can see everything! Disgusting!

224
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,726
You're fired!

225
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,067
Hey, you can't do that!

226
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,652
I just turned sweet on him! Yeah!

227
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,318
Be sweet on him in your own sweet time!

228
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,906
Why did I ever leave Greece?

229
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,491
Oh, that's right,
'cause it's a train wreck.

230
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,753
I never saw either of them again.

231
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,670
If you find your Dad, tell him sorry

232
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,169
from Spiro Papadapaconstanti-
kasgianopolopodopotopolis.

233
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:33,592
Got it. Papadapaconstantikasgianopolop-
odopotopolis.

234
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,014
Now, what was that singer's name again?

235
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,262
Rita Lafleur.

236
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,514
Rita La-what?

237
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,846
-Lafleur.
-One more time.

238
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,641
Ugh! I'll write it down for you.

239
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:47,015
Thank you Mr. Papadapaconstanti-
kasgianopolopodopotopolis.

240
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:51,404
(gasps) There's exactly one Rita Lafleur
living in Springfield!

241
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,034
That's where we live!

242
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,150
Hello? Rita Lafleur?

243
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,777
Did you know a man named Abe Simpson?

244
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,195
Know him? I'm married to him.

245
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,414
(gasps)

246
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,624
Homer, she's married to your dad!

247
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,584
Whoo-hoo! I get two Christmases!

248
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,590
I've read every expert on poker

249
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,422
and watched Jennifer Tilly's DVD.

250
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,877
Start with your Simpsons money,

251
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,636
(high voice) use a little girl voice,

252
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,968
and take 'em for everything they've got.

253
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,564
Now, I'm needed on the set
of <i>Bride of Chucky V.</i>

254
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,561
Time is money!

255
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,193
Money is money!

256
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,649
And money is college,

257
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,859
which should lead to more money
someday, but who knows anymore?

258
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,098
-Tim, what are you doing?
-Bible trivia.

259
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,508
You've been doing that
an awful lot lately.

260
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,347
The Bible is rich with trivia!

261
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,774
I can't believe my Dad never
told me he had another wife.

262
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,364
The man I looked up to my whole life.

263
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,190
You never looked up to him.

264
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,065
Well, it's a good thing I didn't

265
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,452
because I'd be pretty
devastated right now.

266
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,449
(bird caws)

267
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,200
I can't believe you're here.

268
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,242
I'd finally gotten over your father

269
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,365
just a week-and-a-half ago,
and then you two show up.

270
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,334
Well, we certainly don't want
to cause you any more pain.

271
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,745
But we need to know everything,
no matter how shameful and fast!

272
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,545
I understand, but this is hard.

273
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,709
Yeah.

274
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,587
Well, just what attracted
you to my father?

275
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,255
Beneath his mediocrity there was genius.

276
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,354
Then a layer of anger.

277
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,560
Then a beautiful soul.

278
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,980
Then some more anger!

279
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,019
A lot of layers.

280
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,403
(scat singing)

281
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,034

<i>(sighs) After we were fired from</i>
<i>Spiro's, we teamed up...</i>

283
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,410

284
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:10,164
Oh, Abe! (moaning)

285
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,917

<i>RITA: Faster than you'd think.</i>

288
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,012
I was alive when my Dad knew you?

289
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,510
Alive, but very clueless.

290
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,763
So this was after Homer's mother left?

291
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,886
I love men on the rebound.

292
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,273
They always think they've done
something wrong

293
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,731
and they usually come with furniture.

294
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,112
My Dad had furniture?!

295
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,029
I don't know him at all!

Abe! They want to book us

That's fine, doll. Real fine.
Why, we'll...

You know, Europe's no place
for a six-year-old.

314
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,047
He can handle 110 volt,
but 220 would kill him.

315
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,554
But making music is my dream, Abe.

316
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,057
Our dream.

317
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,889
I know, Sugar Tomato,

318
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,524
but I'm all the family this boy's got.

319
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,402
If I don't take care of him now,

320
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,358
he'll forget the day
he's supposed to come

321
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,359
and see me when I'm old.

322
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,492
Are you okay, Daddy?

323
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,914
Well, of course I'm okay! I'm with you!

324
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,874
Good-bye, Rita.

325
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,254
This is why "life" comes before
"love" in the dictionary.

327
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,384
Aw, thanks, son.

328
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,421
Now to make sure neither of us
ever remember this.

329
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,596
(sniffling) Oh, my God.

330
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,522
I never knew the sacrifices
my father made.

331
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,192
Move over, Fonzie.

332
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,610
I've got a new hero.

333
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,609
I never saw Abe again.

334
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,611
But I thought you still loved him.

335
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,703
Life isn't all major chords.

336
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,949
Sometimes you gotta hit the minor keys.

337
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,282
What does that mean?

338
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,487
I got super-addicted to heroin.

339
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,697

340
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,868
(snoring) Yeah.

341
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,958
Okay, education paid for,

342
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,383

343
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,262

345
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,551

00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,437
I'm going all in!

351
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,070
Aw, doggone it!

352
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,901
I give up!

353
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,027
It's like Kenny Rogers' most famous line:

354
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,744
"This is a bad piece of chicken."

355
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,747
He didn't fold?

356
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,121
But that's insane unless he has...

357
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,924
(gasps)

358
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,303
Four threes?!

359
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,759
Oh, no!

360
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,509
No-no-no-no-no, no!

361
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,880
(trilling)

362
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,177
(cash register dings)

363
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,022
(buzzing)

364
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,767
I can't breathe. (gasping)

365
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,731
I've lost, I've lost everything.

366
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,902
(sobbing, muttering)

367
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,476
<i>We can all hear you.</i>

368
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,818
<i>Please log off.</i>

369
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,737
(sobbing)

370
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,576
Aw, come on, Lis.
No gambling story has a happy ending

371
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:19,662
except <i>Seabiscuit.</i>

372
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,327
But you never hear about the ruined lives

373
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,825
of the people who bet against him.

374
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,786
(sobbing) Oh, God...

375
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,957
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me!

376
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,206
I was Ivy! Strong Ivy!

377
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,588
(sobs)

378
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,894
Oh, man, this is priceless,
but I can't keep it up.

379
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,009
You've still got a college fund.

380
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,176
What are you talking about?

381
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,675
I'm Sideshow Bob!

382
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,725
I've been using his avatar to play poker

383
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,942
and trash his favorite
restaurants on Yelp.

384
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,113
And I saved your vegetarian bacon.

385
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,532
Oh, my God! You won the pot?

386
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,781
You must have nearly a million dollars!

387
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,823
I can go to college
and live like a Kennedy!

388
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,657
Listen, after I won,
the website found out

389
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,793
we were both under 18, so we're back
to the original $5,000.

390
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,621
<i>Shame! Shame!</i>

391
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,126
Did you give the money back
to the people who lost it?

392
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,709
<i>Good-bye.</i>

393
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,174
Well, back to square one
is a major victory

394
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,715
in this house,
but why did you help me?

395
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,894
Come on! Tell me!

396
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,889
Because I actually like you
and felt sorry for you.

397
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,972
What?! You did?

398
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,808
Forget I said anything!

399
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,193
{\an8}Sure.
I have the ending for my memoir!

400
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,771
I'm sorry I couldn't
help you find your father.

401
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:33,947
If you find him,
tell him I can still do this. Yeah.

402
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,159
Holy moley.

403
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,080
And tell him to put on a splash of this.

404
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,909
That's Dad's cologne?

405
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,165
I always thought
it was his old-man stink.

406
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,749
When I knew him, it was young-man musk.

407
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,666
Man, you're making me hot for my Dad.

408
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,007
Only place in town
that still sells Chicory Mist.

409
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:01,934
After people found out it's 98% squirrel
sweat, they sorta stopped buying.

410
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,935
-Listen, do you know this man?
-Let me ask around.

411
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,938
Abe, you seen this guy?

412
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,690
Oh, I know him.

413
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,022
He's a man who has no son!

414
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,778
Dad!

415
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,279
Abe, we were so worried!

416
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,323
Dad, promise me you'll never wander off

417
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,027
and make us explore your
fascinating past again.

418
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,538
I didn't wander off, ya big fat salami!
I ran away!

419
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,132
-What?!
-You think I'm boring,

420
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,038
and you never visit me,
and I got sick of waitin' for ya!

421
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,758
So I got a job and found
a new dump to live in

422
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,629
and I didn't tell you about it,

423
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,386
so at least that way I know
you're not coming!

424
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,968
Grampa, we will never miss a visit again.

425
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,305
And there'll be a lot more of them.

426
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,771
And I don't think you're boring.

427
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,022
It's just that in today's
multichannel environment,

428
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,565
you have too many great choices.
Look at Sunday night.

429
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,689
There's, like, eight amazing shows.

430
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,356
None of them on Fox.

431
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,195
Well... when you put it
that way, all right.

432
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,622
I can't say all is forgiven,
but most is forgotten.

433
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,753
Aw...

434
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,745
(sighs)

435
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,295
I guess my honky-tonkin' days are over.

436
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,759
-(melody playing on piano in distance)
-What the...?!

437
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,590
Someone's playin' my tune!

438
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,008
Don't take Grampa's meds.

439
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,717
I'm payin' for 'em.

440
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,227
(piano playing)

441
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,071
Hey, Abe. Good to see you again.

442
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,571
Rita!

443
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,403
You look dynamite!

444
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,778
And you look like you could
use a good ironing,

445
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,235
but I still love you.

446
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,285
Take a seat. Yeah.
