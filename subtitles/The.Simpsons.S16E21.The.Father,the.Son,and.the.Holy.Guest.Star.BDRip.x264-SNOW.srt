(BOTH GRUNTING)

177
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,963
You're just like
your mother!
Can't take a punch!

00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,565
(GROANING)

179
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,443
FATHER SEAN:
<i>I was laying in the gutter
picking up my teeth</i>

180
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,921
<i>when Saint Peter himself
appears before me.</i>

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,729
Sean, you wanker...
<i>He says.</i>

182
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,723
Repent of
your wicked ways
or sod off.

183
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,282
<i>Then he gobbed in my face
and turned back
into a streetlight.</i>

184
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,522
And that's how
I came to the Church.

185
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,730
Well, I'm only here
because I got blamed
for a prank I didn't do!

186
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,841
Mmm-hmm.

187
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,169
Call me crazy,
but I believe you.

188
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,645
You do?
Of course I do.

189
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,088
You know, lots of
church types started off
as rotten wee buggers.

190
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,766
St. Augustine himself
got his start stealing pears.

191
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,881
Stealing pairs of what?

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,002
Hubcaps, Reeboks,
human eyes?

193
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,730
It's all in here.
See for yourself.

194
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,127
Cool!

195
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,847
Sister Thomasina,

196
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,082
I've taken the liberty
of knocking the vinegar
out of him.

197
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,289
He's all yours.
Yeah, whatever.

198
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,402
Now, class,
open your math books

199
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,005
to the word problems
of our Lord.

200
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,602
"Billy and Joseph
start their penance

(GRUNTING)

208
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,127

It's way better
than the comics
I get at the dentist!

212
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,801
Then Father Sean
quoted Eminem
in his sermon.

213
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,121
And in art class,
we painted Saint Joan
burning at the stake.

214
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,730
And mine
was the grossest.

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,724
Bart, I'm glad
you had fun.

218
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,565
But I wouldn't get
too into that
Catholic church

219
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,564
with all the sitting
and standing and kneeling.

220
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,643
It's like Simon Says
without a winner.

221
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,643
Mom, that's blasphemy.

222
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,801
I'll say
a rosary for you.

Don't you touch
bead one! (GRUNTS)

224
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,001
Homer, maybe
we should be concerned.

225
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,361
Catholics can be
a peculiar bunch.

226
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,727
No birth control,
no meat on Friday.

227
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,691
No meat?
What do they eat?
Light bulbs?

228
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,762
Let's just change
the subject.

229
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,444
Bart, would you
like to say grace?

230
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,601
Yes'm.

231
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,921
<i>In nomine Patris
et fillii et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,206
Bart, what the hell
are you saying?

233
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,165
That's Latin, Dad.
The language of Plutarch.

234
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,326
Mickey Mouse's dog?

235
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,205
No. Plutarch!

236
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,681
He chronicled the lives
of the Roman emperors.

237
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,281
Oh! I didn't need
that new fact!

238
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,601
Now I forgot
who won Bud Bowl VIII.

239
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,206
Boy, I'm pulling you
out of that crazy school!

240
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,241
(GRUNTING)
Hey!

241
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,606
I'm Bart Simpson's father.

242
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,126

your time-tested values.

breakfast into dinner.

All pancakes aside,
I really came here
to talk about my son.

256
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,642
I understand.
But can it wait
until after Bingo?

you just say,
"Yay, l won!"

can't ever...

(MUTTERS) You know...

269
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,848
I'll admit,
the vow of celibacy

270
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,524
is one of
our sterner challenges.

271
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,371
Celibacy?
I was talking about the meat
on Friday thing!

Man, you guys
got more crazy rules
than Blockbuster Video!

273
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,368
Well, that's true.
But if you do break a rule,

274
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,206
you can always find absolution
in the sacrament
of confession.

275
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,521
Wait, wait, wait.
No matter what I did,

276
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,208
no matter how many people
lost their pensions,
it's forgiven like that?

277
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,408
If you truly repent,
then yes.

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,729
Okay! Let's make
some magic here.

279
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,724
I wiped a booger
on your shirt.
I made a dog and a cat kiss.

I swiped a bolted down TV
from a Holiday Inn,

I coveted the wife

282

I masturbated
eight billion times,

283
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,488
and I have no plans
to stop masturbating
in the future.

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,201
I can only absolve you
if you're a Catholic.

287
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,881
Right.
And how do I join?

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,570
Do I whale on
some Unitarians?

289
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,563
Well, it's a little harder
than that.

290
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,007
It begins by
looking inside yourself.

291
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,565

292
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,165

out all night.

you've accepted someone

something.

to yell at that priest.

But he's so cool!

299
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,447
He plays drums in a band
with a bunch of other priests!

300
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,927
I knew they'd try
to convert you!

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,604
That's what they do!

Well, I'm not having
another 12 kids!

Mmm-hmm.
Under the weather?

318
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,886
Or under the spell of a man
in a pointy white hat?

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,123
All right. I admit it!
They're both at
the Catholic church!

what should I do?

321
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,404
Marge, this calls for
an emergency meeting

spiritual council.

can't go Catholic.

in 1573.

327
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,765
And that was about
our holy right

328
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,251
to come to church
with wet hair!

329

since abolished.

they're taking an interest
in spirituality.

great, Marge.
