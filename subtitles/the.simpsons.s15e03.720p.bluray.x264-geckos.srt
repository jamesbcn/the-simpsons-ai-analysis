These are little kids.

336
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,741
So take out
your tiny batons.

337
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,451
(CHUCKLES)

338
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,247
Chief Wiggum,
we're just like
you policemen.

339
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,375
Don't you ever
feel like the mayor
doesn't care about you?

340
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,962
You mean, the mayor
who kept me waiting for
two hours in that restaurant?

341
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,131
l ate so much bread. . .
(SOBS SOFTLY)

342
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,008
Sit down, boys!
We're joining
this strike!

343
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,762
Chief, are you sure the mayor
wasn't at a different
Olive Garden than you?

344
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:40,183
Well, l can't take that
rattlesnake out of his
mailbox now, now can l?

345
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,351
Yes, Chief,
you could.

346
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,186
Well, let me ask
you this. Shut up.

347
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:47,232
The Springfield student strike
has entered its fourth day
with no end in sight.

348
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,069
Today professionaI
buttinski Michael Moore
arrived on the scene.

349
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,447
Kids who don't get
to take music and art

350
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,408
are 1 0% more IikeIy
to become chronicaIIy
unempIoyed

351
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,617
and appear in one
of my movies.

352
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,745
Where did you get
that statistic?
Your mother!

353
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,122
The student strikers
have been joined
by other unions

354
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,416
incIuding the
Springfield Goat Milkers,

355
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,252
the Association of
News Room Cue
Card Holders...

356
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,378
Ow.

357
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,047
And the United Federation
of Theme Park Zombies.

358
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:18,054
Zombie eat brains but zombie
cannot swaIIow this injustice.

359
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,850
At the heart of the strike
is former student body
president, Lisa Simpson.

360
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,019
Her brother
had this to say.

361
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,730
Lisa is a nut.
She has a rubber butt.

362
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,566
Every time she turns around,
it goes putt putt.

363
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,779
lndeed. But that rubber butt
doesn't have much time for
turning around these days.

364
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,531
It's pointed squareIy
in the face of the
administration.

365
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,495
Skinner! We have
got to get these
kids back in school !

366
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,663
Willie, can't you
turn your hose on them?

367
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:47,501
They are wee children.
l'd sooner turn it on myself.

368
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,377
Well, that's a
good idea, too.

369
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,547
Now see here,
you nose-wiping
hair-combers!

370
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,051
Back in Edinburgh,
we had a coal
miner's strike.

371
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,471
All we wanted were hats
with a wee light on top.

372
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,973
Then one day
the mine collapsed.

373
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:06,603
No one made it out alive.
Not even Willie!

374
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:13,068
Skinner!
l don't mean to interrupt
your advice from the janitor,

375
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:16,822
but l say cut off the head
and the body will die.

376
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,658
You want to get rid of Lisa?
But she's such a good student.

377
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:24,412
Yes. ln fact, l think
she's a little too
good for this school.

378
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,290
If we stand together,
we are strong!

379
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,042
(ALL CHEERlNG)

380
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,169
Lisa Simpson, you have
just been transferred

381
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,089
to the Springfield
Magnet School for the
Gifted and Troublesome.

382
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,299
Please climb
into the idIing bus.

383
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,844
But, but l. . .

Oh, this place

Well, l guess this story
has a happy ending after all.

392
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,641
Just like my last massage.

393
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,688
l'm not driving
45 minutes a day!

394
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,064
You can't go
to that school !

395
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,983
But this is my dream.

396
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,068
Oh, why can't you
have a normal dream

397
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,070
like being an Olympic
figure skater?

398
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,239
Okay. Let me
take figure skating.

399
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:44,576
Are you crazy?
l'm not getting up
at 6:30 every morning

400
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,662
so you can prance around
a frozen pond and think
you're better than me.

401
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,164
LlSA: Well,
what can l be?

402
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,665

How about
a horse whisperer?

403
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,750

404
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,501
