00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,726
Ah!

347
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,361
Hello, UN Women's
Conference!

348
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,081
(EXCLAIMS)

349
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,611
We're trapped!

350
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,285
Lisa, we may not make it.

351
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,489
But at least we can
go out as the great
journalists we are.

352
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,085
I'm not a journalist.

353
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,651
You are now.

354
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,444
Remember to keep my
boobs in the shot.

355
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,086
And we're on in five,
four, three...

356
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,684
I don't see Lisa in
any of the seminars.

357
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,967
And I'm growing
ashamed of my penis.

358
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,726
(GASPS) Homer, look!

359
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,883
<i>I'm here at the long-dormant
Springfield Volcano,</i>

360
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,725
<i>which is now spewing
noxious debris into the air.</i>

361
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,564
How male.
ALL: Mmm-hmm.

362
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,006
<i>With me is my
8-year-old camera girl,
Lisa Simpson.</i>

363
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,602
She's taken my daughter
to an erupting volcano?

364
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,287
That's it! She is off
the Christmas card list!

365
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,600
Marge, that's
crazy talk!

366
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,769
Now, look, I'll save Lisa.
Your place is
here with the women.

367
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,330
WOMEN: Boo!

368
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,244
Okay, you go save Lisa.
I'll stay here with the women.

369
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,810
WOMEN: Boo!

370
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,883
What do women want?

371
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,684
(FRIGHTENED CRIES)

372
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,288
(GASPS)
We've gotta go now!

373
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,882
Okay. I'll run
as fast as I can,
but I'm full of potato salad.

374
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,371
(GROANS)

375
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,407
I'm sorry, folks. You're not
allowed to go up there.

376
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,409
In fact, I don't
even know why I'm here.

377
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,370
This lava is not a criminal.
It hasn't hurt anybody...

378
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,046
(SCREAMING)

379
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,120
Anybody I know.

380
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,522
Chief, my daughter's up there.
You're a father, too!

381
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,170
Yeah. But I'm a cop first,

382
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,205
then a boat enthusiast,
amateur historian,
yo-yo dieter,

383
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,725
then I'm a cop again...

384
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,840
LISA: Help!
Help! So much sulfur dioxide!

385
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,327
I'm coming, sweetheart!

386
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,561
I'll save you, Lisa!
(RUMBLING)

387
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,651
Oh, my God!

388
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,205
Oh!

389
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,484
Ooh.

390
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,210
Be careful, Mom!

391
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,687
There's hot lava
under the ground!

392
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,482
Actually,
when it's underground,
lava is called magma!

393
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,528
You're so smart, Chloe!

394
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,490
Walter Cronkite
told me the same thing!

395
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,410
Shut up!

396
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,602
Mom, that was incredible.

397
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,441
Oh, nothing's more powerful
than a mother's love.

398
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,005
Mom, your hair!

399
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,764
Don't worry.
We've got two hours

400
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,484
before it burns
down to my head.

401
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,125
Our top story tonight...

402
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,770
I'm about to die.

403
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,970
Oh...

404
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,281
Barney, you
saved my life.

405
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,171
Chloe, when you left me,
I was devastated.

406
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,164
But I sobered up
long enough to
become a pilot.

407
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,961
With you beside me,
I think I could
make it work.

408
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,889
How about a half-hour
of pity sex?

409
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,769
Is there any
other kind?

410
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,966
(BURPS)

411
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,682
<i>In the wake of
the devastating eruption,</i>

412
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,802
<i>one Springfielder
proved herself a hero,</i>

413
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,365
<i>Marge Simpson!</i>

414
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,843
<i>She's won herself
a free hero sandwich
at Springfield Sub Shops.</i>

415
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,129
<i>Extra charge
for warm-ups.</i>

416
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,004
Mom, I want to be
just like you.

417
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,849
I mean the lava part,
not saving Lisa.

418
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,929
Pretend to care!

419
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,650
(GRUNTING)
(CHOKING)

420
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,000
Well, looking
at you kids, I know I made
the right choice in life.

421
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,730
I'm sure you did.

422
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,882
But still, don't you
ever wonder what
might've happened

423
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,371
if things had
gone differently?

424
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,721
Well...

425
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,522
<i>This is Marge Simpson
reporting from Lake Placid</i>

426
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,286
<i>where the "Miracle on
Ice" never happened.</i>

427
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,564
No!

428
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,760
(GRUNTS)

429
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,047
Lisa, what are you
doing in there?

430
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,444
Praying to Buddha,
Jesus, SpongeBob.
There's no time to be picky.

431
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,360
Perhaps we should help.

432
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,925
Screw her!
(LAUGHS)
