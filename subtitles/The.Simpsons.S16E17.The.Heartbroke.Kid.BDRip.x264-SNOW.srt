in town.

344
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,085
Here is your tip, Baldylocks.
If you want it,
dance <i>und</i> sing.

345
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,327
Oh!

346
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,484
(SINGING IN GERMAN)

347
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,086
(ALL CHEERING)

348
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,207
More! More!

349
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,527
They want a second verse.
Hope he knows it.

350
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,650
(CONTINUES SINGING)
(ALL CHEERING AND LAUGHING)

351
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,249
This is all my fault.

352
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,926
I'll never eat junk
food again. I swear!

353
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,407
Good for you.
That's what
I want to hear.

354
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,608
It's time to take action.
I'll meet you later, son.

355
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,089
I'm gonna get
the car washed and try
to meet somebody.

356
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,761
(STRAINING)

357
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,649
MACHINE: <i>Dude, you've changed.</i>

358
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,731
(GRUNTING)

359
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,771
<i>Yo, I'm gonna cap
a pop in your ass.</i>

360
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,401
Huh!

361
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,761
I'm ending your vending, dawg.

362
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,601
Bart, what are you
doing here?

363
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,121
I've learned my lesson.

364
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,885
Mr. Spangler showed me
the true cost of
my junk food addiction.

365
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,644
But you're still fat.

366
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,042
Not for long!
I'm saying goodbye
to Scammer and Z-Dog.

367
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,647
I've learned that even
made-up corporate shills
can lie to you.

368
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,883
Did you hear that,
Foxy the Fox Network Fox?

369
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,691
When I raged
against the machine,
money poured out.

370
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,761
Oh, boy!

371
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,128
Marge, I know
this is ill-gotten,
but can we use it to...

372
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,443
To give these Germans
<i>das Boot? Jawohl!</i>

373
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,087
Uh, please to have new
face cloth, schnell.

374
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,811
Time to take
out the Eurotrash!

375
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,609
(YELLS)
(ALL SCREAM)

376
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,203
Oh, no! Who will put up
with our nonsense now?

377
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,363
To Disneyland,
where we will heap
the scorn on Goofy!

378
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,244
(ALL CLAMORING)

379
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,681
Now everything's
perfect again.

380
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,922
Excuse me.
I think I left
my belt here.

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,001
No, you didn't.

382
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,481
Don't tell me I didn't.
That's my lucky belt!

383
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,884
Long story. Good one.

384
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,246
Folks, you have
three weeks left

385
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,164
on a nonrefundable
weight-loss treatment.

386
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,164
So if anybody else
in the family wants
to use it, use it now.

387
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,004
But who else needs
to lose weight?

388
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,165
Maggie? Grampa?
My seldom seen
half-brother, Herb?

389
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,442
Why is everyone
looking at me?

390
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,929
I am not too fat.
I'm alive, aren't I?

391
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,048
Mr. Simpson,
you're suffering
from PSI.

392
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,731
Poor self-esteem.

393
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,847
It's not "I"!

394
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,729
Every sign is wrong!

395
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,086
Oh, that's terrible.

396
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,045
We got a long drive ahead.

397
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,930
You want to pull
off at a motel?
We'll split a room.

398
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,525
Where will I sleep?

399
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,763
We can worry about that
when we're standing naked
before the bed.

400
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,491
My goodness!
No wonder you eat!

401
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,449
TAB: What are you eating now?
HOMER: Cheeseburger.

402
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,126
TAB: You're a catastrophe.
Let me have half of it.

403
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,201
HOMER: I don't wanna.

404
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,170
TAB: I just want the cheese.
I don't want the meat.
I do want the meat!

405
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,969
HOMER: Here's a corner.
TAB: Let me just bite it.

406
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,041
Don't rip it!

407
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,963
Let me have the whole thing!
You'll get some later!

408
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,201
HOMER: You're a selfish jerk!

409
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,282
TAB: I've smelled it.
It has to be eaten.

410
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,441
HOMER: But it's my burger!

411
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,363
TAB: I'm driving.
I'll kill us.

412
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,044
HOMER: (MOUTH FULL)
Fine. I'd rather die!

413
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,171
(SHUSHING)
