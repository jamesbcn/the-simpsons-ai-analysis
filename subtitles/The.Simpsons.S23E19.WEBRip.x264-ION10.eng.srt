We saw how much
this cruise means to you,

72
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,998
so we all
sold something special.

73
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,039
And we made just enough
for an economy cabin!

74
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,543
I sold a couple of my
rare jazz records.

75
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,996

to getting sick of it.

78
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,136

79
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,549

80
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,967

Yeah...

82
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,016
actually, my mom stole it
from a woman she cleaned for.

83
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,063
Took her years
to get the whole set.

84
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,976
And Dad donated
something, too.

85
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,145
What happened
to my mini-pool table?!

86
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,994
I was training
to be a mini-pool hustler.

87
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,160
We sold it
to pay for a family cruise.

88
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,410
I never even got to realize
this jacket was too small.

89
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,004
It's weird to hear
myself saying this, but...

the best vacation ever!

92
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,964
Yeah, for you kids, maybe.

93
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:59,594
For dads, a family vacation
is a 24-hour-a-day babysitting job.

94
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,304
"Are you wearing
enough sun block?"

95
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,344
"Is that splashing or drowning?"

96
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:07,598
"Why does every sand castle
require my participation?"

97
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,602
Then a kid disappears,
and it's total panic

98
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,685
until you find him
at the swim-up bar...

99
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,060
...eating a 30-dollar cheeseburger,

100
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,528
which he drops in the water!

101
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,738
And here's the worst part:
I never get anytime alone

102
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,700
with my wife because we're all
sleeping in the same room!

103

169
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,055
Help me study the effects
of rising ocean acidity.

170
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,316
No, help me tag
and release seabirds.

171
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,529
It's so diverse.

172
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,819

to a PBS Kids show!

181

Ghana or Portugal?

182

Boy, thanks to you,
we're having fun--

183
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,378
"before you were born" fun.

184
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,965
Where did the ship
stop again?

185
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,260
I don't know, a lot of barefoot kids
kicking soccer balls,

186
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,845
shell necklaces; they really
hid the poverty nicely.

187

point of our voyage,

193
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,952

it only lasts a week.

soggy with the sweat

than Ganymede, Lisa.

like they were
worthless garbage.

340
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,564
Bart, glad you're here.

341
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,771
We're all gonna watch
a movie together.

342
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,152
Yeah, a movie!

343
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,438
It is about time you guys
started having some fun.

344
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,991
Humanity must endure.

345
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,858
General, it's worse
than we thought.

346
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,065
The virus is getting bigger.

347
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,195
(roaring)

348
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,951
(screaming)

349
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:14,953
(gasps)

350
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,544
Bart, how could you?

351
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,038
Uh, got to go!

352
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,080
Man, I kicked butt
in the gladiator arena today.

353
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,786
I won the last package
of hot dogs on the ship.

354
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,627
I got robbed by marauders
on the way home.

355
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,473
There is no virus!

356
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,968
Bart faked the whole thing
with a DVD.

357
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,141
A direct-to-video DVD.

358
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,770
You stand accused
of letting down your team

359
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,229
during music trivia.

360
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,939
Your fun-ishment: eight hours
in the penal conga line.

361
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,902
(gasps)

362
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,151
(groaning rhythmically)

363
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,074
Excuse me,
Cruise Director Priddis.

364
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,164
My son has something
to tell you.

365
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,239
Speak, passenger,
son of passenger.

366
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,406
It was all a hoax;
there's no virus.

367
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,535
(crowd gasps)

368
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,501
But the warning from the general!

369
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,171
That was just Treat Williams
in a virus movie.

370
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,000
You know, I thought
that general looked familiar.

371
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,667
What?
I'm in a lot of movies.

372
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,256
(Simpsons gasping,
crowd grumbling)

373
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,053
I take back everything
I said to you

374
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,427
that night in the dolphin lab.

375
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,425
(gasps)

376
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,016
All that happened is we got
a little extra vacation.

377
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,232
Is that so bad?

378
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,311
MAN:
I think I ate people meat!

379
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,356
(groans)

380
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,229
I know my son
did a terrible thing.

381
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,396
But there's a chapel
on this ship,

382
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,445
and in that chapel
there's a book,

383
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,529
and it says,
"Judge not, lest ye..."

384
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,445
(groans)

385
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,994
After this,
I'll be lucky to get work

386
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,037
on a clothing-optional
Jimmy Buffett cruise!

387
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,622
What about the duty-free
stuff we bought?

388
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,957
"Never have fun!"

389
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,053
My booze and cologne!

390
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,338
(grunting worriedly)

391
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,643
(humming)

392
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,689
That's fair.

393
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,571
Sorry.
I deserve it.

394
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,779
Ow! That one really hurt.

395
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,610
Sorry, sweetie, I just needed
to get that out of my system.

396
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:20,277
This stupid prank is the most
selfish thing you've ever done!

397
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,367
I wasn't being selfish.

398
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,712
I did it for you guys, too.

399
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,288
Lisa, you made friends
with kids just like you.

400
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,964
Mom and Dad, you were more happy
and in love than I ever saw you.

401
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,384
It was the best week
of all of our lives,

402
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,973
-and I wanted it to last forever.
-(Lisa and Marge aahing)

403
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,219
Choke on my numb
blue hands!

404
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,052
(grunting angrily)

405
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,927
Oh... what the...

406
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,934
(groaning)

407
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,636
LISA:
Hey, up here!

408
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,976
You got to see this!

409
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,770
ALL:
Ooh!

410
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,685
LISA:
From egg to baby to grown-up,

411
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,074
we can see them living

412
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,031
their entire penguin lives
from up here.

413
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,571
(crackling)

414
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,864
(chirping)

415
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,487
BART:
What a load of crap.

416
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,704
They spend all their time
trying to raise a baby, and why?

417
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,825
So it can grow up
and do the same dumb thing,

418
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,374
on and on forever.

419
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,247
The penguin's life isn't all bad.

420
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,964
Those ones are having a blast.

421
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,217
But the slide's
just like our cruise:

422
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,969
a short awesome thing
that just shows you

423
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,091
how boring the rest
of your life is.

424
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,758
Well, sure,
life is full of pain and drudgery,

425
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,927
but the trick is to enjoy
the few perfect experiences

426
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,687
we're given in the moment.

427
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,229
Yeah, stupid.

428
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,572
Stop thinking about fun
and have it!

429
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,069
("Winter's Love"
by Animal Collective playing)

430
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,991
Whoa... whoa...!

431
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,320
(laughing)

432
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,914
Hey, wait for me!

433
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,739
(all laughing)

434
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,091
What a great ride.

435
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,774
Shh!

436
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,988
