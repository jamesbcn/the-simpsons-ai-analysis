00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,447
MILHOUSE:
Uh, Bart? Lisa has a note...

182
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,449
Shut up, Milhouse.

183
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,350
MILHOUSE:
Ow.

184
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,521
<i>And those cool</i>

185
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,549
<i>'Gurt Squad friends</i>

186
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:09,063
<i>that hype up
Bart's prank videos?</i>

187
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,486
<i>Paid Spucklers.</i>

188
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,331
Hey, guys,
you don't have to go home

189
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,297
just 'cause
we're done filming pranks.

190
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:19,065
Yeah, we was meaning
to ask you about that.

191
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,166
How is what you do a prank?

192
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,139
This just seems like
a mean-spirited waste of yogurt.

193
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,268
Okay, we'll use pudding.
Great note.

194
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,284
Hey, you guys want
to jump on my trampoline?

195
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,376
I'll take
the safety barrier down.

196
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:35,418
We prefer to keep our
relationship professional.

197
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,075
I'll... pay you.

198
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,554
(groans) Fine.

199
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,262
Time and a half.
And a basket of eggs.

200
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,455
Our hen is feeling poorly.

201
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:45,756
<i>MILHOUSE:
Even my off-again, off-again
girlfriend Lisa</i>

202
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,899
<i>fell prey to the siren's call
of Internet fame.</i>

203
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,097
What the hell is this?
This beach is spotless.

204
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,400
MILHOUSE:
Sorry, Lisa. We're on it.

205
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,473
(grunts)

206
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:00,771
Now where's this thing
I'm supposed to save?

207
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,744
MILHOUSE:
Uh, Gil, how's it coming?

208
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,313
I-I'm trying. Ow!

209
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,351
This little fella's really
good at freeing himself.

210
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,377
CREW PERSON:
That's a rented seal. Catch him.

211
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,924
We're gonna lose our deposit.

212
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,949
(both grunting)

213
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,124
But let's take a look
at the relationship

214
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,833
that started
this whole crazy ride:

215
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,855
Homer and Maggie.

216
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,001
We are so excited
to work with Maggie

217
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,456
on this viral campaign for

218
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,074
<i>Nom-Noms 6:
European Nom-cation.</i>

219
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,237
We got Maggie's room all set up

220
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,036
for the ultimate immersive
Nom-Nom experience.

221
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:35,009
Uh, one little hiccup.

222
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,608
Maggie's terrified of Nom-Noms,

223
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,081
especially the girl one.

224
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,919
I'm not sure why.
Uh, Bart will do it.

225
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,845
The yogurt kid? No way. No.

226
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,121
Either the Internet baby
goes in there,

227
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,648
or you forfeit
all nom-pensation.

228
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,094
So that's, uh, "nom"-negotiable?

229
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,531
- (chuckles)
- That's not a real word.

230
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,227
Maggie, there's
a cute baby bunny in there,

231
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,270
so put this GoPro
on your head...

232
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,606
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.

233
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,935
(Maggie shrieks, cries)

234
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,979
NOM-NOMS:
Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-
nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom...

235
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,107
(Maggie screaming)

236
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,452
(Maggie crying)

237
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,483
Oh...

238
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,089
Maggie, I'm sorry.

239
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,531
(Maggie fussing)

240
00:10:25,526 --> 00:10:29,196
Poor Maggie. Although
I like the girl Nom-Nom.

241
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,556
I like her a lot.

242
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,534
I like the way her glasses
have eyelashes and...

243
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,874
LUANN:
Milhouse,
come do your ear drops.

244
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,499
Mom!

245
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,743
(mouse clicks)

246
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,741
Hey, guys.

247
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,042
Welcome to episode 751 of

248
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,014
<i>The Lenny and Carl Situation.</i>

249
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,623
Back with us
is our frequent guest Moe.

250
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,215
You gonna behave today, Moe?

251
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,017
(chuckling):
Hey, don't cancel me, huh?

252
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,190
Today we're talking about
the Simpson family,

253
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:59,559
specifically "Super Dad"
himself, Homer Simpson.

254
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,490
Guy's a phony.

255
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:03,404
Full disclosure:
You go back five, six months,

256
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,227
we were best friends
with the guy

257
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,872
before he got famous
for those baby videos.

258
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,938
Yeah, so many nights getting
blackout drunk with Homer.

259
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,768
I don't remember him
mentioning that baby once.

260
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:17,014
And I heard Maggie won't make
any more videos with him.

261
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,180
What people been seeing
is all high-tech trickery.

262
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,621
Intern Barney, play the clip.

263
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:30,018
HOMER: Mmm.

264
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,533
Oh, even fake Maggies
hate me.

265
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,756
(laughing)

266
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:35,631
You know, I'm thinking about

267
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,196
going on the all-peanut diet.
You heard about this?

268
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,698
Supposed to be great
for the adrenals.

269
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,000
You know, the Aztecs,
that's all they ate was peanuts.

270
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,002
Not like the crap we got today.

271
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,774
Them ancient nuts,
they was full of that, uh, uh,

272
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,243
niacinnamonites. Yeah.

273
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,482
'Cause of the sand they had.

274
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,676
And they lived to be a hundred,
200 years old.

275
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,378
- (man groans)
- MOE: Same thing with
the Mayans and cashews...

276
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,651
MAN:
Uh-uh.

277
00:11:58,819 --> 00:11:59,619
(mouse clicks)

278
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,720
Hey, guys.

279
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,391
We know there have been
a lot of rumors going around.

280
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,530
So we wanted
to formally announce

281
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,896
that we'll be making
a formal announcement

282
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,095
tomorrow night on our livestream

283
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:13,297
which will address
all the recent controversies.

284
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,770
And we'll Cluck-Stop at nothing
to earn your trust back.

285
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,871
(grunts)

286
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,742
<i>FRINK:
That was nine days ago.</i>

287
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:24,611
Nobody has seen or heard
from the Simpsons family since.

288
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,451
Over the next two hours,
I will break down my theories

289
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,977
on what might have caused
their dramatic disappearance

290
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:34,594
on this special edition of...

291
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,718
That's your cue.
This special edition of...

292
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,964
<i>Frinkileaks.</i>

293
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,659
Now play
the suspenseful music.

294
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,733
No, that's a latte macchiato.

295
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,972
(suspenseful music playing)

296
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:51,508
Well, you might as well
finish my coffee now.

297
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,565
(grunting)

298
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,790
Which brings us once again
to Snowball I,

299
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,918
which... (groans)

300
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,593
Marker fumes. Oh, my.

301
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:15,163
Hoyvik! Blarvlagin! Ivy.

302
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,562
(clears throat)
I apologize.

303
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:20,203
Um... in summary, I have
concluded that the Simpsons

304
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,500
are being held hostage
by a major tech company.

305
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:26,274
Now, I cannot
say which one, but, um,

306
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,583
follow the Google Doodles.

307
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,248
If, uh, you pause
right where the video glitches,

308
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,379
you can see Homer
doesn't look human.

309
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:41,024
More like an alien wearing
an ill-fitting human suit.

310
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,261
Let me tell you something,

311
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:45,056
Homer Simpsons has done more
for this country

312
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:49,128
than Dr. Fauci
and Dr. Pimple Popper combined.

313
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,829
It's not his fault
he has a trash son

314
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,172
with a face
like a lunch bag, okay?

315
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,968
Leave Homer Simpsons alone!
Leave him alone!

316
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,341
(enunciating):
Welcome back to Patty...

317
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,080
(enunciating):
And Selma's...

318
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,375
BOTH:
Tingle Palace.

319
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,148
We were going to do part four

320
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,847
of our scalp-delousing
role-play.

321
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,791
(tines riffling)

322
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,786
But, in light of recent events,

323
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:18,028
we're going to tell you what
we think happened to our

324
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:22,225
sister Marge Simpson.

325
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,430
(scales rubbing)

326
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:28,972
It's pretty obvious
that Homer snapped,

327
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,869
ate the whole family.

328
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,471
and is hiding on a houseboat,

329
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,912
in a cloud of belches
that used to be his wife

330
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,539
and kids.

331
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,954
(grunts)

332
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,377
(scraping)

333
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,581
- (man shudders)
- (mouse clicks)

334
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:46,124
Hmm... hmm.

335
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,489
What's up, guys?
Today we had

336
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,357
a whole cemetery parkour
segment ready to go,

337
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,187
but instead we've got
a big announcement.

338
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,263
The location
of the Simpsons' mansion

339
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,032
has always been super secret,

340
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,470
but we figured out where it is.

341
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,365
We found clues
in all their old videos.

342
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,438
We're talking
regional birdsongs,

343
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,007
town-specific
ice cream truck jingle.

344
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,076
But the clincher:
my mom's dating a guy

345
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,835
who got fired
from the post office,

346
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,713
and he gave us their address.

347
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:14,452
We're heading there tonight
to get some answers.

348
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,148
But first, parkour.

349
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,779
Parkour. (grunts)

350
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:18,854
Beloved husband!

351
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,622
Angel-baby!

352
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:22,891
Jewish guy! Parkour!

353
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,260
- (mouse clicks)
- MAN: Eh...

354
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,158
- Huh.
- (mouse clicks)

355
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,258
Hey, guys, I'm Shauna.

356
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,231
With a freaking exclusive.

357
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,399
I found the Simpsons mansion.

358
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,398
What the hell, Jimbo?
Did you tell her the address?

359
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,601
JIMBO:
Duh. She's my girlfriend. Hey...

360
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,408
(grunting)

361
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,937
MARTIN:
Martin Prince here, now embedded

362
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,683
at the Simpsons family compound.

363
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:48,048
SHAUNA:
We're about to get
scooped, dumb-wads.

364
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:52,218
Hey, guys, Simpsons...
(speaking gibberish)

365
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,219
Like and subscribe.

366
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,660
- PATTY: Hey, guys.
- COMIC BOOK GUY: Hey, guys.

367
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:56,715
- SHERRI AND TERRI: Hey, guys.
- MOE: Hey, guys.

368
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:58,333
(gasps) It's a vlog swarm.

369
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,025
No, no, no. This is our content.

370
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,328
JIMBO:
Okay, okay.

371
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,859
(Crazy Cat Lady
speaking gibberish)

372
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,374
JIMBO:
But turn on that light.

373
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,396
NELSON:
This way, come on.

374
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,172
(all panting)

375
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,670
Ha! Look at this.

376
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:14,512
They obviously left in a hurry
without their phones.

377
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:17,738
Shut up.
I can't hear myself Shauna.

378
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,982
- Move out, people, let's go,
let's go, let's go.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

379
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,981
(gasps)
Huh?

380
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,893
(all shouting)

381
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:26,846
- Hmm?
- What is this?

382
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:28,764
(all grunt curiously)

383
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,185
- (Simpsons gasp)
- I found 'em!

384
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,630
Somebody get a pic!

385
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,255
Bart, the door!

386
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,559
- MARGE: Grab it!
- LISA: Get it!

387
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,827
Welcome, Simpson family.

388
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,442
So, nine days
in a panic room. Why?

389
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,396
Well, Opal,
our house had been built

390
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,244
by a company we partnered with
that, at that point,

391
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:50,411
had only built NFTs of houses.
(chuckles)

392
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,210
They installed
the panic room door backwards.

393
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,583
You could get in,
but you can't get out.

394
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,392
But how did you all
end up trapped there?

395
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,885
Well, we'd been getting ready
for our redemption livestream,

396
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,919
and we were all a little tense.

397
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:06,134
So I went to the panic room,
where we stored

398
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,786
all of our sponsored crap,

399
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,964
to get some
children's CBD gummies.

400
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:12,233
But I was already in there
pounding 'em.

401
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:17,744
<i>MARGE: Then I ran in
and yelled, "Stop fighting.</i>

402
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,308
<i>"You're going to sweat through</i>

403
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,506

404
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:22,778
<i>BART:
But when we tried to leave,</i>

405
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:23,906
<i>it was locked.</i>

406
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:25,811
<i>LISA:
I said, "Nobody panic.</i>

407
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,782
<i>There's got to be
a panic button."</i>

408
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,221
<i>HOMER:
Then I walked in, saying,</i>

409
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,286
<i>"Marge, I can't find
the fridge again."</i>

410
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,215
<i>LISA:
We tried to grab the door.</i>

411
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,450
But it was too late.

412
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,464
We were trapped,
and it was all Homer's fault.

413
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,127
What? You said
it was nobody's fault.

414
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,997
That's what
I'm supposed to feel,

415
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,655
but I'm not there yet.

416
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:46,404
<i>LISA:
We survived on products
we'd been shilling</i>

417
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,070
<i>but had never
actually eaten before.</i>

418
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,099
Luckily, there was
also a huge supply

419
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,244
of single-use hat-toilets.

420
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,980
Uh, I'm pretty sure
those were just hats.

421
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:58,046
We didn't have any way
to post content,

422
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:01,445
<i>so we went through
pretty severe withdrawal.</i>

423
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:09,217
<i>MARGE:
Then, sometime around day four,</i>

424
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,093
<i>I said, "Where's Maggie?</i>

425
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,191
<i>She was just here a second ago."</i>

426
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,528
<i>I moved the table from the wall
and said,</i>

427
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:20,100
<i>(gasps) "Oh, God. She must've
crawled in the vent."</i>

428
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,570
<i>HOMER:
I said, "Maggie, come back."</i>

429
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,239

431
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,109
<i>I'd just be Daddy.</i>

432
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,511
<i>And then...</i>

433
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,983
<i>LISA:
She'd been in the cabinet
the whole time.</i>

434
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,152
<i>We were so relieved.</i>

435
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,393
<i>MARGE:
Then we realized how high up
she was, and then...</i>

436
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,586
<i>BART:
But Homer made an awesome catch.</i>

437
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:42,718
<i>And Maggie barfed on him.</i>

438
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,533
<i>(chuckles)
Classic.</i>

439
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:48,832
<i>MARGE:
After that,
something strange happened.</i>

440
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,369
<i>We started talking
to each other.</i>

441
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:54,165
<i>BART:
Like texting with our mouths.</i>

442
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,668
<i>LISA:

00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:58,339

444
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,308
<i>MARGE:
It felt like we were
coming out of a trance.</i>

445
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,738
<i>LISA:
The only subscribers we needed</i>

446
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,984
were in that room.

447
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,879
Wow. Just, wow.

448
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:11,251
We're shutting down
the YouTube channel

449
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,561
because "The Simpson Family"
isn't who we are.

450
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:17,285
We are the Simpsons.

451
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,931
We are completely offline now.

452
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,727
I don't even check
email anymore,

453
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:24,498
but that's mainly 'cause we
moved back to Evergreen Terrace,

454
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:28,468
and our neighborino changed
his Wi-Fi passwordily-durdily.

455
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,998
Well, there you have it.

456
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,343
A confusing, nonsense-word end

457
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,909
to the meteoric rise and fall

458
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,838
and disappearance
and reappearance

459
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,854
and return to status quo

460
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,946
for the family
the Internet could not

461
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:43,248
get enough of
for almost half a year.

462
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,050
Can we go look at your beehives?

463
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:47,352
Nah, we're all done here.

464
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,624
Well, that's four hours
of my life I'll never get back.

465
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:54,604
WOMAN:
George R. R. Martin, you better
be working on that new book.

466
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:56,025
I am.

467
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,469
You said you would finish
it years ago.

468
00:19:58,465 --> 00:19:59,565
I'm gonna.

469
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,296
They already made two TV shows
about it.

470
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:05,512
I know that.
I went to the parties.

471
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:08,536
No more parties until
you finish that book.

472
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,042
I'm writing it right now.

473
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,383
I'm... doing research.

474
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,179

475
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,746
Oh.

476
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:20,218
You did not just stick
your hands in the mint bowl.

477
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,160
Girl, use the spoon,
or I'm gonna have to
