1
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:13,360
Come on, come on, come on.
Pick up the pace.

2
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:14,596
Here you go.

3
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:24,282
Hurry up! It's almost here.

4
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:28,891
Yippee!

5
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,664
My industrial-grade
steam vacuum.

6
00:00:31,764 --> 00:00:33,266
The same model
they use to clean

7
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,740
grisly crime scenes
and sticky champagne rooms.

8
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:39,880
Okay, ma'am, I have you down
for a three-hour rental

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,953
starting... now.

10
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:44,656
Everybody, out, out,
out, out, out!

11
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:47,562
Me and the floors deserve
to savor every minute

12
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:49,666
of our special spa day.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,935
And take the dog.

14
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:54,375
Now it's my time

15
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:57,448
to make these stains "herstory."

16
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:00,822
Ugh, are you quoting
their actual slogan?

17
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:04,462
I'm quoting my wildest dreams.

18
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:11,376
Dog park, dog park, dog park!

19
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:12,177
Whee!

20
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:13,948
Whee! Whee!

21
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:15,852
Trampoline park,
trampoline park,

22
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:16,952
trampoline park!

23
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:19,693
Aw, don't leave me alone
in that giant dirt toilet

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,699
with all those lonely
dog-obsessed weirdos.

25
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,770
Please.

26
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:30,414
Well, what could go wrong
with all those doctors around?

27
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:36,259
- Hey, Homer.
- What are you doing here?

28
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,731
Once it became
clear that human companionship

29
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:40,133
was a non-starter,

30
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,039
I adopted this handsome
little mister, Devin.

31
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,208
He loves it here.

32
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:45,688
The training books say
it's important

33
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:47,047
to keep your dog socialized.

34
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:49,051
It's not a book park.

35
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:50,755
And now that you're here,
I have somebody

36
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:52,191
I can talk dogs with.

37
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:54,930
So, where'd you get your dog?

38
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:56,834
Uh, I think he came
with the house?

39
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,537
Look at us, dog-talking.

40
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:01,142
We'll meet here every morning
at 7:00 and have our own club.

41
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:02,545
The Dog Dad Boyz.

42
00:02:02,646 --> 00:02:04,348
I'll reach out
to logo designers.

43
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,754
Oh, God, somebody
get me out of this.

44
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:12,699
Aah! Dev-Dev!

45
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,636
Control your psycho, maniac.

46
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:15,605
Bad dog dad.

47
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:18,343
Membership
in the Dog Dad Boyz revoked.

48
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,517
Oh, you saved me from
the worst kind of human...

49
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,619
A dog lover.

50
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,322
I love you, dog.

51
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:26,593
Let's go get you a reward.

52
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:33,406
Okay, wait here for two minutes
while I get your treat.

53
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,110
I'm gonna open
the windows halfway

54
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:37,014
and leave the AC running.

55
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:42,926
What ice cream flavor
will make my dog feel

56
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:46,633
like the most cherished creature
in the entire universe?

57
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,350
Hey, check it out.

58
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,321
Some jerk left their
dog in the car.

59
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:59,826
With the windows
rolled up, no less.

60
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,997
- Who does that?
- Monster.

61
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:05,538
Obviously, no chocolate,
but he does love peanut butter.

62
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:08,109
Rum raisin is a no,
for any species.

63
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:12,151
What kind of lunatic
thinks this is okay?

64
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:15,090
Some people are
just born broken.

65
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,768
Puppy spoiler, coming through.

66
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:21,770
Hey, what am I missing?

67
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:23,708
A churlish individual saw fit

68
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:26,613
to desert their dog
in a hideous sedan.

69
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:29,085
Wait, it's not
what it looks like.

70
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:31,957
I just left my dog
in my car on purpose.

71
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:37,401
Whoa, how could you, man?

72
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,873
And on a scorcher like today?

73
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,442
What? It's not a...

74
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,050
Come on boy, help me out.

75
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:47,121
Get the keys. Get the keys.

76
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:50,060
You expect him to work
under these conditions?

77
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:51,362
No, wait.
I think Marge

78
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:53,166
hid a key
under the car somewhere.

79
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,772
The dog-cooking wuss
is trying to hide.

80
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,976
Grab his legs!

81
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,750
Leave me alone.
I'm good with dogs.

82
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,225
He locked the Dalmatian
in the firetruck. Oh!

83
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,131
Gotta be kidding me!

84
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:12,605
Okay, everyone. The dog's fine.

85
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,543
Why don't you all
just get a life.

86
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:17,314
No wonder his dog
is such a psycho.

87
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:19,686
He's probably a bad parent, too.

88
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,222
How dare you?

89
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,794
Dad, you forgot to pick us up.

90
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:27,869
Glad that's over,
aren't we, boy?

91
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,875
Uh, I'm not so sure.

92
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:43,199
Oh... yes.

93
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,036
This must be

94
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:47,642
how Catholics feel
after confession.

95
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,380
Now, to post some
before-and-after shots

96
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:53,787
so the neighbors can eat their
dirty carpet hearts out.

97
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:57,027
No.

98
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:01,202
No. No...

99
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,941
No!

100
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:08,183
Okay, so far, the neighborhood
rage is contained

101
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:09,485
to just dog lovers.

102
00:05:09,553 --> 00:05:12,090
Oh, no. It's spread
to the cat people.

103
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,328
Oh, now it's
the horse crazies.

104
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:17,334
Those horse crazies
don't mess around.

105
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:20,975
Homer, you have
to apologize for yesterday.

106
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:23,213
What? Why?
The dog and I are cool.

107
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:26,653
Look, we know you didn't
mean to do anything wrong.

108
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:29,559
But sometimes you just
need to accept responsibility

109
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:30,862
so people will move on.

110
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:34,368
So, I drafted you
a heartfelt apology.

111
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,938
That's so sweet, honey.

112
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:38,476
But trust me, it'll blow over.

113
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:43,621
When God gave man dominion over

114
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,292
all the beasts of the Earth,

115
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,731
that was not
permission for one man

116
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:51,269
to abandon a dog
in a hot Plymouth.

117
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:57,682
Mm. Okay, I get it.
Everybody's mad at me.

118
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:59,285
Dad, nip this in the bud

119
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:01,557
and use my apology.

120
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:05,263
I'm Homer Simpson,

121
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,234
and I'm truly sorry.

122
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,340
Tsk, tsk, tsk!

123
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:14,381
Sorry if you pee-pee babies
were offended by something

124
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,485
that was no big deal
and everything's fine.

125
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:17,889
So what's the issue?

126
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:20,761
Amazing job, you really
got his voice down.

127
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:23,734
Okay, Homer, I think
you've made your point.

128
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,540
I'm sorry that you don't have
enough things to get mad at.

129
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,409
I'm sorry that you all have skin

130
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:30,447
thinner than gas station
toilet paper.

131
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:32,885
And I'm sorry that your
lives are so boring

132
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:35,625
that you take a man
who left his rescue dog

133
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:38,429
for two minutes to buy him
organic ice cream

134
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:41,102
from a woman-owned
local business,

135
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,972
and you crucify him!

136
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,813
Ow, my dog's eye!

137
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:10,728
My fellow Springfielders,
here at Burns Industries,

138
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:13,901
we release the hounds
on all forms of disrespect,

139
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:17,240
and to tolerance
we say, "excellent."

140
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,345
As such, we have
terminated association

141
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:21,382
with Homer J. Simpson,
as his actions

142
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,887
do not represent
the values of Evil Corps.

143
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,392
Moving forward,
we plan to sit back,

144
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:28,831
tent our fingers, and listen.

145
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:31,803
Well, Homer, on the plus side,
this has made people forget

146
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,907
- you almost killed the dog.
- Oh...

147
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:41,799
of the guy who pushed a pastor
out of a church window.

148
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,763
Uh-huh. And would you
classify that as a death threat

149
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:47,502
or merely an
act of extreme violence?

150
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,004
Thank you for your rage.

151
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,512
Oh, Lovejoy's fine.

152
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:55,383
But I lost my job and now
that trolls put my photos

153
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,787
and phone number
on the Internet,

154
00:07:56,853 --> 00:08:00,327
I also lost
my anonon-nim-ninim-ninity.

155
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:01,997
There's also a bunch of TikToks

156
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,201
of people lip-syncing
to what you said,

157
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,971
because that's
what comedy is now.

158
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:07,842
I'm sorry that you all have skin

159
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:10,380
thinner than gas station
toilet paper.

160
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,754
Oh, I've never been
so viciously lampooned.

161
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:16,058
I hate this horrible new world.

162
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,997
What I need now
is the comfort of fast food

163
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,968
and slow friends.

164
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:33,493
Three weeks later.

165
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:36,098
Shrimp? Who you calling shrimp?

166
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,165
It's prawn time, baby,

167
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,639
at Dead Lobster's
Annual Prawn-a-thon!

168
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:42,177
Grab your bib
for crispy popcorn prawn,

169
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:45,483
wood-grilled prawn skewers
sizzling prawn scampi,

170
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,454
and parmesan-breaded
prawns casino

171
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:49,692
served over ice cold lump prawn.

172
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:53,534
All washed down with a tropical
Tiki Passion Prawn-tini.

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,803
Guys!

174
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:57,775
It's Prawn-a-thon time. Guys!

175
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,380
They wouldn't go without me,
would they?

176
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:07,592
Oh my God, everybody, shut up.

177
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:08,997
It's the pastor-pusher.

178
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,410
Well, I never.

179
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,951
Why am I always meeting
people who never? Mm.

180
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,592
Hey, "strangers," enjoying
your entrées of embarrassment

181
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:24,328
about being related to me?

182
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,769
Don't take it personally.

183
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,473
We need to be able to do
some normal family things

184
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:32,210
without being publicly shamed.

185
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:36,452
We just want a little
anon-mini-nanom-nini-ninity.

186
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:38,156
But Prawn-a-thon?

187
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:39,959
That's our special thon.

188
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,431
I'm so upset
I might not ever be able

189
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:44,201
to get my prawn on again.

190
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:47,642
Yikes. That has got to be
the saddest thing

191
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,779
ever said in a chain
seafood restaurant.

192
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:51,482
It's not too late, Homer.

193
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,685
I'm here to help you.

194
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:54,021
Help me?
Is this

195
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,560
some kind of prank,
like when those YouTubers

196
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,463
chased me with real machetes?

197
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,601
Wow. And no.

198
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,137
I have created a refuge

199
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:04,709
where people like you
can find redemption.

200
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,982
I run an institute.
We call it The Institute.

201
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,823
And it might just be
your last chance

202
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,961
at rehabilitating
your reputation.

203
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:17,167
Wait, wait, are you saying
you can steam clean,

204
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,267
if you will,

205
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:21,342
my husband's reputational
carpet, if you will?

206
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:24,716
I am, and I will. And I will.

207
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:26,853
The Institute is his only hope.

208
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,794
Well, my reputation
is everything to me.

209
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:33,600
That doesn't jibe
with your past behavior.

210
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,573
I'm tired of reputations
being about past behavior.

211
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,946
I'll do it.
Keep it safe.

212
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:50,200
Here at the Institute,
we break our rehabilitants up

213
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,805
according to the severity
of their mistakes.

214
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:55,410
Uh-huh. Yep.

215
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:57,113
That makes sense.

216
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:58,282
Interesting.

217
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:02,692
We don't take any Halloween
mishaps more recent than that

218
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,664
because, at a certain point,
you should know better.

219
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,900
Totally.

220
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,402
Homer, meet your team.

221
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:11,776
Just like you, they all went
stupid viral in a bad way.

222
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:15,518
First up, Helen Lovejoy,
aka "Lemonade Karen."

223
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:16,820
Let me see your permit.

224
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,924
Where did you steal
these lemons from?

225
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:21,161
I don't think you're even
from this neighborhood.

226
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:22,832
Siri, call 911.

227
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,838
Councilman Jed Hawk,
aka "The Toilet Rocker,"

228
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:28,944
who always forgets to turn off
his camera and hit mute.

229
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:37,962
Oh, no.

230
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:41,335
Larry Doogan,
aka "Pissed-O-Shorty."

231
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,139
He throws tantrums in public.

232
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:43,941
A lot.

233
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,978
Oh sure, the club's at capacity

234
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:47,748
as soon as the short guy
shows up.

235
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:49,786
I get it, and I'm pissed-O!

236
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:51,923
Oh, so you don't have any
blueberry muffins left

237
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,096
for the short man? I'm pissed-O!

238
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:57,234
I do... realize you only agreed

239
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,971
to spend the rest
of your life with me

240
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:01,977
because I'm short, and it's pissing-me-o!

241
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:05,350
Kirk Van Houten,
aka "Juice Box Dad."

242
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,356
Come on, Coach Loser,
don't you want to win?

243
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:12,197
Take... my son...
out... of the game!

244
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,042
Oh, yeah, I shared that.

245
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:19,211
Juice Box Dad.

246
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:22,484
Wait, how am I supposed
to revive my reputation

247
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:24,054
associating with these scum?

248
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:25,824
Watch who you're calling short.

249
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:28,563
Whoa, somebody's pissed-O.

250
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,933
Siri, call 911.

251
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,437
Look, everyone,
let's just calm down.

252
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:35,443
Or what? You'll push us
out a stained glass window?

253
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:39,217
Hey! That was just a careless
accident born out of rage.

254
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,029
Are we sure we have the right
people for this team?

255
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:47,835
They're awful.

256
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:51,475
Which is why they're perfect
for this mission.

257
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:03,141
Here at the Institute, we believe
good works overcome bad days.

258
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:04,869
So, to fix your reputations,

259
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:07,440
your team will be doing
public acts of charity.

260
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,610
When we post them online,

261
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:11,382
they will make your
transgressions a distant memory.

262
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:12,484
Work together?

263
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:15,691
Sorry, I don't exactly
play well with others.

264
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,802
Okay, then we'll spend the day

265
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:19,331
doing a bunch of team-building
improv exercises.

266
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,101
Good deeds! Good deeds!

267
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,816
I can feel my reputation
being restored

268
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:47,487
with each carefully-staged
good deed.

269
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:53,099
Look, it's the people
the Internet told us to hate.

270
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,908
They still hate us.
The plan isn't working.

271
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:00,146
What do we do now?
Call 911?

272
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:02,117
Unfortunately,
that was the only way

273
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:03,987
to get you your lives back.

274
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:07,260
Well, there is one other way.
No, we can't.

275
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,999
- What?
- No, it's too radical.

276
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:13,874
Ah, but it's the only thing
that's 100% guaranteed to work.

277
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,111
Hmm, yeah, it does sound
pretty radical.

278
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,882
Thanks for being honest
about that.

279
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:19,786
Well, sometimes
the only way to get results

280
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:21,255
is through radical action.

281
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:23,459
Sorry, we took a vote.
It's too radical.

282
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,280
Wh... I didn't even
tell you what it is yet.

283
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:26,933
When you said "radical,"
you said enough.

284
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,135
Bye forever.

285
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,373
Look, I thought that
by calling it radical,

286
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,010
you'd be more likely
to want to do it.

287
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,880
Like you'd be intrigued
or something.

288
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,653
Intrigued, eh?

289
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,890
You are all here
at The Institute...

290
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:41,763
...because of
the humiliation you faced

291
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:44,301
after the world
saw you on your worst day.

292
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:47,340
But, what if you could
delete all that

293
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:50,881
from every computer,
every phone, every meme,

294
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:53,920
and even every personal
hard drive on Earth?

295
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,956
But that's impossible.

296
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:58,229
You'd have to invent
something to do that.

297
00:14:58,295 --> 00:14:59,565
Funny you say that.
I did

298
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,536
invent something to do that.

299
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:04,174
A universal eradication code
that can completely scrub

300
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:07,213
any image or video
from the entire Internet.

301
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,151
Scrub us.
You scrub us right now!

302
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:11,890
Oh, I would, but first
I need to upload the code

303
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:13,459
into the one server
powerful enough

304
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:16,331
to reach every corner
of the World Wide Web.

305
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:18,770
ChumNet.

306
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:21,676
You mean the company
that puts those annoying

307
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:25,082
clickbait-y headlines
on the bottom of every website?

308
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,120
Yes, they're everywhere.

309
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:30,193
No platform has greater reach.

310
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:32,197
But to upload the scrub code
into their servers,

311
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:36,004
I need you to break in
to the ChumNet headquarters.

312
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:38,342
Break in?
That sounds dangerous.

313
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,375
It is, Helen.

314
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,215
That was the radical part
I mentioned earlier,

315
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,319
that didn't seem
to land with any of you.

316
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:45,323
Radical, eh?

317
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:47,260
Yeah, we don't have
anything to lose.

318
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:50,266
So, we're kind of like
a suicide squad.

319
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,305
You're exactly kind of like
a suicide squad.

320
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:54,509
What do you say?

321
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:56,746
I think we can pull this-O.

322
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,115
I say we do it.

323
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,455
We need to fight for each other,
because we're a family.

324
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:05,163
A family I don't want or need.

325
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:07,835
I miss my actual family,
so let's do this.

326
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:11,308
But if we're going
on a commando mission,

327
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:13,112
don't we need
some sort of training?

328
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,549
Don't you see?

329
00:16:14,615 --> 00:16:17,220
You've already had
some sort of training.

330
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:38,195
We're in.

331
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,999
Okay, just stay focused

332
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,003
until you find
the ChumNet server room.

333
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:43,773
What about
all the people in there?

334
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,478
There are no people.
Just clickbait.

335
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,556
So whatever you do,
don't stop to click on anything.

336
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:07,621
Who falls
for this garbage anyway?

337
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:10,059
Wait, what does she look like now?

338
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:13,800
"80 NFL players
who live in bad houses.

339
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,504
Number six will shock you."

340
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:17,775
Well, we'll see about that.

341
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:19,144
"One simple trick to add

342
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:20,881
years to your height."

343
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:23,385
Whoa, these headlines
are so tempting.

344
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:28,897
No!
We have to remember our goal.

345
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:33,239
Erasing our shame and returning
to our pre-pariah lives.

346
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:34,341
Oh, no.

347
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:37,648
They're all trapped in endless
slow-loading slideshows.

348
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:39,084
These houses suck.

349
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,623
Sucks, sucks, sucks.

350
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:44,160
Number six.

351
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:46,131
Homer, get them out now!

352
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,947
I just wanted to know
which vegetable

353
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,851
gut doctors are begging me
to throw out.

354
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:59,491
It's radishes. I could have
told you it was radishes!

355
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:01,930
Find the server room, Homer,
you'll be safe there.

356
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:04,502
This is prawn-demonium!

357
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:11,381
Okay, straight ahead
is the access port.

358
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,555
Insert the flash drive.

359
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,258
Once the scrub code
is fully uploaded,

360
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:17,861
everything will be erased,

361
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:21,001
and you will return
to a life of anon-min-mity.

362
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,272
Anon-min, Amoni-mity.

363
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,909
It's "anonymity."

364
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:29,150
Preparing global Internet scrub
for the following individuals.

365
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:31,556
There we are.

366
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:35,964
Wait, who are they?
I recognize these people.

367
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:37,233
They're really terrible.

368
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,872
That guy raised the price
of insulin for fun.

369
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:41,809
I think that guy
was just president,

370
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,747
and those are his kids.

371
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:45,182
And, oh, my God,

372
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:48,288
that's the football coach
that does all the cheating!

373
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:50,527
Yes, Homer.
All evidence of their misdeeds

374
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:51,729
will be erased too.

375
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:52,598
But that's different.

376
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,935
Those people did
actual bad stuff.

377
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:57,073
Wow, lot of Russian generals.

378
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,444
Upload at 60%.

379
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:00,714
Jeebus crackers.

380
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:02,216
So the only way
to save myself

381
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:04,889
is to erase the crimes
of history's current monsters?

382
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:06,291
Oh, wise up, Homer.

383
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,830
Who do you think funded
this entire operation?

384
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,667
Scrubbing these villains

385
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,072
is what The Institute
was always really about.

386
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:14,174
What do I do?

387
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:16,211
Wait, I never
had a handkerchief.

388
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:19,885
Oh, this is the apology
Lisa wrote for me.

389
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:21,932
The upload's nearly complete.

390
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:24,060
I can think of almost nothing
at the last minute

391
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,162
that will stop us now.

392
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:26,536
"It is with my family's support

393
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,402
that I will strive
to do the right thing."

394
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:31,074
I will strive
to do the right thing!

395
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:33,278
Homer, listen, you don't know
what my investors

396
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,784
are capable of doing to people
who don't help them cover up

397
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,320
what they're capable of doing.

398
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,126
You don't know
what I'm capable of doing.

399
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:44,234
Yoinking this doodad
out of the computer hole.

400
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:47,941
Internet scrub cancelled.

401
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:49,712
Idiot! You ruined it!

402
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:51,582
No, my daughter ruined it

403
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,322
by writing the most genuine
and inspirational apology ever.

404
00:19:55,423 --> 00:19:57,260
You should hear it.

405
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:00,801
I'm Homer Simpson,
and I'm truly sorry.

406
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,504
Sorry, yet also grateful

407
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:03,773
for this opportunity...

408
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,409
In the annals of time,

409
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:06,946
there have only been five

410
00:20:07,046 --> 00:20:08,917
truly great public apologies.

411
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:11,221
But on that day,

412
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:13,860
the words Lisa wrote,
and Homer somehow read

413
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:15,362
to everyone in the world,

414
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:17,467
put those others to shame.

415
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:19,270
It was deeply soul-searching

416
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,408
and 100% effective.

417
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:24,414
Homer was forgiven by all

418
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:27,053
and beloved forever.

419
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,823
You failed us.

420
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:31,996
We're gonna do to you
what we did to democracy:

421
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:34,234
Irreparable damage.

422
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,104
The plan was too radical.

423
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:39,277
Too radical!
No, no, no!

424
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:40,747
Radical...

425
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:43,452
Radical!

426
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,588
And because of all of you, from here forward,
I will be the best Homer Simpson I can be.

427
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:59,050
There you have it...
A reminder that we could all be

428
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,956
a little more understanding
of one another's humanity.

429
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:03,225
Up next,

430
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:06,264
dumb idiot
has heart attack on treadmill.

431
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,137
Another plate of shrimp.
J. K.

432
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:10,237
It's prawns.

433
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:14,882
I should have listened
to you all along.

434
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,451
Yeah. Well, mostly, you just

435
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:18,222
shouldn't have left
the dog in the car.

436
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:20,727
Yeah, agree to disagree.

437
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:22,831
But he and I
have an arrangement.
