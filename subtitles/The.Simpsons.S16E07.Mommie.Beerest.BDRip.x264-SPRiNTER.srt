An episode of <i>Boy Meets World</i>
on this flight.

340
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,608
Oh, no, wait.
That's only on
flights from Europe.

341
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,047
We just get
that little plane.

342
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,531
Hey, wait a minute.
What the hell is that?

343
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,602
Hang on, Marge!
Homie's coming!

344
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,001
I won't let that
man make you happy!

345
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,122
(SIREN BLARING)
Oh!

346
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,050
Simpson, you were
going 100 in a 25 zone,

347
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,327
and you're not gonna flirt
your way out of this one.

348
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,051
But l have to
get to the airport
to save my marriage!

349
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,488
Really? Well, why didn't
you say so? Let's roll!

350
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,927
You didn't work this hard
to save my marriage.

351
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,447
Again with that. Wake up, Lou.
She was way out
of your league.

352
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,289
FEMALE VOICE:
<i>Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.</i>

353
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,531
<i>Time for some
shuba-duba in Aruba.</i>

354
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,967
Oh, my God!

355
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,566
Moe, did you see
something troubling
on the tarmac?

356
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,880
No. Why do you say that?

357
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,403
You got to get
me closer, Chief!

358
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,323
Anything for love!

359
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,481
(GRUNTS)

360
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,607
Okay, time to chase
this pig into the sty.

361
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,445
Uh, Marge, you deserve
a man who listens to you,

362
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,443
who respects you,
who understands

363
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,483
what a treasure
you really are.

364
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,324
I don't know what to say.

365
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,564
Just say you love me, Marge.
Love me like I love you.
Please?

366
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,810
HOMER: Marge!

367
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,530
That sounds like Homer.

368
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,045
No, it isn't.
I don't hear nothing.
You're crazy.

369
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,406
Get out of here.
Will you marry me?

370
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,960
Homer! How'd you
get in here?

371
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,451
Toilet hole.

372
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,287
You leave my wife alone!

373
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,447
You don't deserve her!

374
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,806
You know nothing
about Marge.

375
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,086
What's her favorite food?

376
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,924
Uh, ice?

377
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,843
Wrong! It's buttered noodles.

378
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,921
He's right.

379
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,369
Oh, it's true.
I don't know Marge at all.
I'll just go home now.

380
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,209
(GASPING)

381
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,411
(SCREAMING)

382
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,970
Shut it! Shut it!

383
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,287
(GRUNTS)

384
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,285
Moe, you've won.
I'll see you
at baggage claim.

385
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,646
Hot damn, I won!

386
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,610
Marge, I swear I'll be
the best man you ever had.

387
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,728
It's gonna be all flowers,
and back rubs,

388
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,842
and, "How was your
day, dear?" and...

389
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,691
Moe! No,
I don't love you,

390
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,240
and I'm certainly not going
to leave my husband.

391
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,324
You mean I listened to all
your touchy-feely
yip-yap for nothing?

392
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,845
I'm afraid so.

393
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,524
At least I had
a couple of sips from your

394
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,005
Coke when you
went to the bathroom.

395
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,570
(SOBBING)

396
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,324
Homie...

397
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,291
Marge, I just want to say,
if you ever feel
like cheating on Moe,

398
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,441
here's my card.

399
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,722
Homer, I made a vow
on our wedding day
to stay by you,

400
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,165
for better or worse.

401
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,204
And besides, I love you.

402
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,726
You're my
Homie-womie-romie-domie.

403
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,485
And you're my
Margie-wargie-bargie

404
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,331
fargie-gargie-margie-
targie-largie.

405
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,691
I may have dodged
a bullet here.

406
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,090
Might as well face it,
I'll never find anyone.

407
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,484
Come on tide, take me with ya.
I just don't want
to feel no more pain.

408
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,291
Ow, ow, ow! Ow! Oh!

409
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,328
Moe, I need to tell
you something.

410
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,766
(GRUNTS) Ow!

411
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,085
You showed me
you could be
a really sweet guy.

412
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,209
You can make a woman
very happy someday.

413
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,970
Wow. For realsies?

414
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,880
It's true.
You'd be quite a catch

415
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,689
if you'd just shower,
and shave,

416
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,609
and stop swearing
under your breath.

417
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,649
Aw, thanks, Marge.

418
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,768
Know-it-all bitch.

419
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,243
Oh! Uh, did I mention
there was a mistake
at the front desk? (LAUGHS)

420
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,927
Really?
Is it one that will change
the sleeping arrangements?

421
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,970
Could be. Could be.
(CHUCKLES)

422
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,850
Listen, I got to tell you,
I chew in my sleep.

423
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,410
Yeah, well, I sweat blood.

424
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,482
Good night, both of you.

425
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,801
(GASPS)

426
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,370
Who's watching the kids?

427
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,767
Are you sure Mom
and Dad want us

428
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,201
to enter a European
balloon race?

429
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,731
