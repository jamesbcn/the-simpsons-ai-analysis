23
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,169
{\an8}(groans) I gotta find
something else quick.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,380
{\an8}Why don't you bring this
potato? It's pretty big.

25
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,712
Mom, you're always trying
to give me potatoes.

26
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,628
-What is it with you?
-I just think they're neat.

27
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,217
I need something
for show-and-tell.

28
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,813
Just take one of my geodes.

29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,771
The rocks on my desk.

30
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,854
No, that's a trilobite.

31
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,807
That's petrified wood.

32
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,355
Bart, that's a bran muffin!

33
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,532
(school bus horn honks)

34
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,704
Greetings, fellow geode-ologist.

35
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,076
(groans)
I'll be right back!

36
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,169
(growling)

37
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,968
The ingredients were
fresh pureed tomatoes,

38
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,220
water, salt and sodium benzoate

39
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,563
used to retard spoilage.

40
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,349
Once again,
if I'm not mistaken,

41
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,983
this can contained
tomato paste.

42
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,562
Thank you, Nelson.

43
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,107
I look forward to seeing it
again next week.

44
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,321
Bart, you're up.

45
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,987
Boys and girls,
Mrs. Krabappel,

46
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,084
I come before you today
to solve a riddle

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,120
that has plagued
mankind for centuries.

48
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,124
What has four legs
and ticks?

49
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,917
-A walking clock?
-A walking clock!

50
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,922
I'd wager he has some variety
of walking clock in that box.

51
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,505
Bart, is it
a walking clock?

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,300
What? No, it's my dog.

53
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,764
-(all gasp)
-Oh, he is a gem!

54
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:04,306
Here, boy. Would you like these
cookies Martin made for me?

55
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,482
My raisin roundies!

56
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,061
My dog's name is
Santa's Little Helper.

57
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,977
One time he crawled under
the house, and when he came out,

58
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,605
he was covered with ants.

59
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,822
Then he ran into a church
and drank all the holy water.

60
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,153
ALL: Wow!

61
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,777
Thank you, Bart.
Great job.

62
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,865
(all cheering)

63
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,490
I knew the dog
before he came to class.

64
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,001
Kaboom! That, the sound of
the thunderous volcanic explosion

65
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,877
which gives birth
to the magnificent geode,

66
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,835
one of nature's most--

67
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,386
You're doing it wrong! You gotta
pet him hard so he can feel it.

68
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,561
(grumbles, sneezes)

69
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,680
Look, look, look!
The doggy sneezed!

70
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,477
-Ha! It thinks it's people.
-(knocking)

71
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,811
Oh, poochie. Here,
poochie, poochie, poochie!

72
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,767
(grunts)

73
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,901
(clears throat)

74
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,573
My geode must be acknowledged.

75
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,993
Oh, brother. All right.
Back to show-and-tell.

76
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,583
Bart, why don't you
put the doggy away?

77
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,449
(students groaning)

78
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,868
(whimpers)

79
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,167
(sniffing)

80
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,426
{\an8}Mmm.

81
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,219
{\an8}More testicles mean more iron.

82
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,814
(moaning, whimpering)

83
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,522
Uh, Miss Hoover,
there's a dog in the vent.

84
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,736
Ralph, remember the time you
said Snagglepuss was outside?

85
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,819
He was going to the bathroom.

86
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,576
Uh, I-- I know Weinstein's
parents were upset,

87
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,409
Superintendent, but I-- I was
sure it was a phony excuse.

88
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,286
I mean, it sounds so made-up.
"Yom kip pur."

89
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,745
(chuckles, stammers)

90
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,625
(shouting, cheering)

91
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,303
Sir, you've got to come quick!

92
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,722
There's a dog runnin' around
in the air ducts!

93
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,352
I understand. Children,
this is Principal Skinner.

94
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,680
<i>Remain calm.</i>
<i>There is a dog in the vents.</i>

95
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,146
(shouting, cheering)

96
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,232
(grunts)

97
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,778
(slobbers, panting)

98
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,453
Willie, go into the vent
and get him!

99
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,492
What? Have you gone
waxy in your "beester"?

100
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,327
I cannot fit in the wee vent,
ya croquet-playin' mint muncher!

101
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,834
Grease yourself up
and go in, you...

102
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,916
you guff-speaking
work slacker.

103
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,132
Ooh, good comeback.

104
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,218
Lunch Lady Doris,
have you got any grease?

105
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,759
Yes. Yes, we do.

106
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,392
Then grease me up, woman!

107
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,139
Okeydokey.

108
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,643
(grunting)

109
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,065
(gasps)

110
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,282
(gasps)

111
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,241

112
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,611

113
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,157
(beeping continues)

114
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
-(beeping intensifies)
-Good Lord!

115
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,866
It's coming up
right behind him!

116
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,415
What the-- No! No!

117
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,841
(laughing)

118
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,420
{\an8}(laughing continues)

119
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,005
(students shouting)

120
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,264
Ow! Ow! Stop it!

121
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,934
Children, teachers,
back to your rooms.

122
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,563
Uh-oh. Whenever I get
this upset, I get hiccups.

123
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,061
(hiccups)
Oh, right on cue.

124
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,812
(all laughing)

125
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,975
-(barks)
-(grunts, groans)

126
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,789
(grunts, laughs)

127
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,708
There's nary an animal alive that
can outrun a greased Scotsman.

128
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,709
Now, out we go.
(grunts)

129
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,996
(gasps)

130
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,296
'Tis more dizzyin'
than the belfry

131
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,720
at St. Corgegluynwaagen's.

132
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,549
(students murmuring)

133
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,846
That's nice work, boys.

134
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,970
(panting)

135
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,596
MRS. KRABAPPEL:
Uh-oh!

136
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,653
Someone's getting a visit
from Superintendent Chalmers.

137
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,188
I... (hiccups)
can't... (hiccups)

138
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,152
take... (hiccups)
this. (hiccups)

139
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,243
-Skinner!
-Superintendent Chalmers,

140
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,199
you didn't have to come
all the way down here.

141
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,570
Everything's under control.

142
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,076
(screams)

143
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,489
Oh, I have had it!

144
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,447
I have had it with
this school, Skinner!

145
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,037
The low test scores,

146
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,752
class after class of ugly,
ugly children!

147
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,173
Oh, now I really think
the children's appearance--

148
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,632
Seymour, you are in very,
very big trouble.

149
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,973
-(barks)
-(gasps)

150
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:50,178
Why, looking into this loveable
mutt's eyes just melts my heart.

151
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,931
Seymour,
all is forgiven.

152
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,314
(yelling)
Make way for Willie!

153
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,273
I said make way for Willie,
ya bloated gasbag!

154
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,274
-Seymour.
-Hmm?

155
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,026
-You're fired!
-(gasps)

156
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,198
I'm sorry. Did-- Did you
just call me a liar?

157
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,698
No. I said you were fired.

158
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,199
Oh. That's much worse.

159
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,326
(hiccups)

160
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,960
(gobbling, gulping)

161
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,303
I thought I'd be jumping
for joy the day Skinner left,

162
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,089
but now all I have
is this weird,

163
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,843
hot feeling in
the back of my head.

164
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,546
That's guilt. You feel guilty

165
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,306
because your stunt wound up
costing a man his job.

166
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,058
Yeah, I guess it is guilt.

167
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,305
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me get this straight.

168
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,515
They let everybody
out of school early

169
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,686
just because you
brought a dog?

170
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,395
-Well, yeah, but--
-Well, I'm off to work.

171
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,696
The dog has had
enough excitement.

172
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,069
But, Marge,

173
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,275
dogs can never have
enough excitement.

174
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,196
Look. Whee! Whee!
(laughing)

175
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,374
Whee, whee!
(laughing)

176
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,964
All right, all right.
I won't take the dog. Come here.

177
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,711
-(Marge groans)
-Aw.

178
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,970
Boys and girls, because of
Mr. Skinner's sudden departure,

179
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,718
I've had to appoint
a new principal.

180
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,261
-Leopold.
-(all gasp)

181
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:18,765
All right, you little punks.
Prick up your freakin' ears,

182
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,189
because I'm only
gonna be saying this once.

183
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,899
From now on,

184
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:27,439
things are gonna be very,
very different around here--

185
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,605
-(all gasp)
-...with your new principal, Ned Flanders.

186
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,855
(applause, cheering)

187
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,578
Well, tippity-top o' the a.m.
to every-good-body here.

188
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,909
As chairman of the P.T.A.,
I am de-didilly-lighted to take over,

189
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,786
and I think I can put
the "Pal" back in principal.

190
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,173
(all laughing)

191
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,552
Yeah, and I'll put the "super"
back in superintendent.

192
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,300
(person coughs)

193
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,973
It's the same exact joke.
What gives, Leo?

194
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,812
Now, I know everybody's eager
to get back to class--

195
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,638
MRS. KRABAPPEL:
Ha!

196
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,024
But I thought
it might break the ice

197
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,180
if we had a little "Q" and "A."

198
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,481
Dude, ask a question,
or we'll have to go back to class.

199
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,736
Um--

200
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,568
-Yeah, you.
-Uh, yeah.

201
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,913
Uh, I was wonderin',
do you, uh--

202
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,660
What's your policy
on, uh, lunch?

203
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,455
Well, let me just say

204
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,168
I want to put the "stew"
back in students.

205
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,959
(all laughing)

206
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:32,214
It's just a damn popularity
contest with you kids.

207
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,218
Now look what you've done,
you little freaks!

208
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,519
Young man,
your gargantuan cone

209
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,979
is making a mockery
of our self-serve policy.

210
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,020
Bart, look.
It's Principal Skinner,

211
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,904
and I think
he's gone crazy.

212
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,731
He's not wearing
a suit or tie or anything.

213
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,317
Principal Skinner, um,

214
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,913
I'm real sorry about
my dog getting you fired

215
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,740
{\an8}and biting you and then
getting it on with your leg.

216
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,497
Well, maybe
it was for the best.

217
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,290
Now I-- I finally have time
to do what I've always wanted--

218
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,996
Write the great American novel.

219
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,336
Mine is about a
futuristic amusement park

220
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,551
where dinosaurs
are brought to life

221
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,222
through advanced
cloning techniques.

222
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,891
I call it
"Billy and the Clone-osaurus."

223
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,890
Oh, you have got
to be kidding, sir.

224
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,482
First you think of an idea
that has already been done.

225
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,728
Then you give it a title
that nobody could possibly like.

226
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,191
Didn't you think this through?

227
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,230
...on the best-seller
list for 18 months!

228
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,614
Every magazine cover
had it!

229
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,111
...most popular movies
of all time, sir!

230
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,613
What were you thinking?

231
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,614
I mean, thank you.
Come again.

232
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,202
Bart, I've barely been here
a-a good solid week,

233
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,497
and you've been sent
to my office 11 times.

234
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,961
And now that I have
peanut butter cups,

235
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,002
you seem to be getting
in trouble every hour.

236
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,916
Must have been a coincidence.

237
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,554
Anyhoo, Bart, you're
gonna have to be punished.

238
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,302
This isn't just
some sort of clubhouse.

239
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,844
(ice rattles)

240
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,387
Oh, sorry. Were you
drinking Slice or Yoo-hoo?

241
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:07,521
Now let's see.
"Tide. Cheer.

242
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:11,311
"Bold. Biz.

243
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,317
"Fab. All.

244
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,860
Gain. Wisk."

245
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:22,235
I believe today
I will try... Bold.

246
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,414
Bart, how are you?
How's school?

247
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,124
Um, it's--
It's a lot of fun.

248
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,206
Hmm.

249
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:35,212
Well, it was good
to see you.

250
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,296
It was? Well, then we
should get together again.

251
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,721
Say, Saturday at my house.
Do you know where I live?

252
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,510
Uh, no.

253
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,098
Hmm. A flaming bag, eh?

254
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,814
Well, these new Italian loafers
will make short work of it.

255
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,269
Uh, I'm kinda busy
on Saturday.

256
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,567
(grunts, laughs)

257
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,900
Hey!

258
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,985
(chanting)
We got Skinner's underpants!

259
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,070
And there's nothing
you can do about it, Mr. Ex-principal.

260
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,158
That's not true.
I can buy a new pair.

261
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,664
No, I can't.
I needed those. I really did.

262
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,550
Oh, you must be
Seymour's friend.

263
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,974
He's up in his room.
Don't touch the wallpaper.

264
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,474
-♪♪ (Beethoven's 5th Symphony)
<i>-♪ Ba-ba-ba-bum ♪</i>

265
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,017
<i>♪ Ba-ba-ba-bum ♪</i>

266
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,691
Now a little more allegro
than last time. Bart!

267
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,521
(chuckles)
Welcome.

268
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,026
Can I offer you a diet
caffeine-free Dr. Pepper

269
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,528
or an individual
fruit cocktail cup?

270
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,151
Uh, I'll pass.

271
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,778
Hey, what's this?

272
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,494
Oh, that's my old unit
from Vietnam.

273
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,535
I was their sergeant.
They were my loyal troops.

274
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,750
That photo was taken shortly
before I was shot in the back,

275
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,542
which was very strange because
it was during a Bob Hope show.

276
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,046
I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to
put on some pants, for God's sake!

277
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,049
Seymour, your friend
Bart is here!

278
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,931
I know, Mother!

279
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,428
Seymour, do you want me
to tell you when it's 7:30?

280
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,972
No, Mother!

281
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,515
(laughing)

282
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,730
{\an8}Ned Flanders actually
eliminated detention

283
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,652
{\an8}and put the whole school
on the honor system?

284
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,531
{\an8}(laughs) Yeah. The teachers
are afraid to leave the faculty lounge.

285
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,700
{\an8}(both laughing)

286
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,239
{\an8}Oh, that place must be
falling apart.

287
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,914
Oh, mercy.

288
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,164
Nobody's
mentioned me, have they?

289
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,746
Uh, I thought I heard someone
say your name in the cafeteria,

290
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,173
But they might have been
saying "skim milk."

291
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,342
Yeah, yeah.

292
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,877
Hmm.

293
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:48,546
-(claw snips)
-Ahh! Ohh! Yee!

294
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,847
I thought you might like
this restaurant, Bart.

295
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,601
They'll make a pizza pie
with a topping of your choice.

296
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,194
Hey, Seymour!
You want your usual table?

297
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,810
No, no, Luigi.

298
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,897
I'd like one with two seats.

299
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,612
I'll be dining
with a friend tonight.

300
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,402
Hey, good for you, huh?

301
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,325
Hmm. They treat you
real nice here.

302
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,488
Hey, Salvatore,
guess who's here!

303
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,787
Mr. Kookalamanza
and-a some real ugly kid.

304
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,712
(students shouting)

305
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,418
This is great!
Not only am I not learnin',

306
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,637
I'm forgettin' stuff
I used to know.

307
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,638
(laughs)
And it's all thanks to you, Bart.

308
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,721
Yeah, great.

309
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,595
What's the matter?

310
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,642
Don't you see, Milhouse?
We've gone too far.

311
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,897
-We need Skinner back.
-My water dish is empty!

312
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,951
(school bell rings)

313
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,659
GIRL'S VOICE: <i>I learned to read</i>
<i>because of you, Principal Skinner.</i>

314
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,950
MARTIN: <i>Sir, I baked you</i>
<i>these raisin roundies.</i>

315
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,754
RALPH: <i>Principal Skinner, I got</i>
<i>carsick in your office.</i>

316
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,499
(sobbing)

317
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,167
Oh, you're Seymour's friend.

318
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,126
Here. He left you this note.

319
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,547
SKINNER:
<i>Dear Bart...</i>

320
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,811
<i>However, I've decided to return</i>
<i>to the only thing besides school</i>

321
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,060
<i>that has ever given</i>
<i>my life meaning--</i>

322
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,069
(groans)

323
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,783
Table for one.

324
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,873
Oh, you miss your friend, huh?
Don't you worry.

325
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,660
My cooking,
she'll-a cheer you up.

326
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:40,535
Hey, Salvatore, give-a the ugly kid
a pan of the red crap!

327
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,666
It's good to have another
combat veteran around here.

328
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,137
I myself received
a number of medals

329
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,138
for securing that Montgomery Ward
in Kuwait City.

330
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,561
Mm, yes, colonel. Now,
I understand it'll be my duty

331
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,770
to mold the new recruits
into a well-disciplined,

332
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,441
highly trained infantry unit.

333
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,439
Sure, I guess.
Here they come.

334
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,771
(vehicle approaching)

335
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,106
(chattering)

336
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,072
Hi. Where do I get
my grenades at?

337
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,913
Uh, they don't have them group
toilets here no more, do they?

338
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,410
Ned, Homer and I are
a little concerned

339
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,294
with the way
the school's being run.

340
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,921
Yes, deeply concerned.

341
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,129
Well, I may go a little bit easy on
the old hickory dickory stick,

342
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,130
but that's just because my dad
was so hard on me when I was a boy.

343
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,510
Whoopsy-doodle.

344
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:40,306
Oh, man! Ned spilled ink
all over my poems!

345
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,562
He's a real flat tire.
I mean a cube, man.

346
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,515
He's putting us on the train
to Squaresville, Mona.

347
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,235
Hmm?

348
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,570
<i>♪ I met a woman</i>
<i>in Paris, France ♪</i>

349
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,526
<i>♪ Had a big hole</i>
<i>in her underpants ♪</i>

350
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,617
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where did you pick up that filth?

351
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,372
We heard Sergeant Clark's
company singing it, sir.

352
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,455
Yes, well, there will be
no smut in my company.

353
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,250
You're in this man's
army to learn.

354
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,964
<i>♪ I don't know</i>
<i>but I've been told ♪</i>

355
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,796
<i>♪ The Parthenon </i>
<i>is mighty old ♪</i>

356
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,131
<i>-♪ How old ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We don't know ♪</i>

357
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,257
That's real good
but needs improvement.

358
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,475
(sighs)

359
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,150
Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner
could become any more of a square,

360
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,520
but there's the proof.

361
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,016
It's weird, Lis.

362
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,278
I miss him as a friend,

363
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,279
but I miss him even more
as an enemy.

364
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,911
I think you need Skinner, Bart.
Everybody needs a nemesis.

365
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,949
Sherlock Holmes
had his Dr. Moriarty.

366
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,993
Mountain Dew
has its Mello Yello.

367
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,497
Even Maggie has that baby
with the one eyebrow.

368
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,999
(wheel squeaking)

369
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,512
(incoming ordnance)

370
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,563
Man on the range!
Change your trajectory!

371
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,392
(all grunting)

372
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,977
Sixteen brand-new
gas pumps!

373
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,823
At last we can compete
with the Gas-n-Gulp.

374
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,989
(incoming ordnance)

375
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,200
If there was some way
to get rid of Flanders,

376
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,781
would you want to come back?

377
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,236
Ah, I must admit
I do miss the school.

378
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:25,246
Frankly, the army isn't
quite as I remembered it.

379
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,790
Up yours, Sergeant!

380
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,955
Actually, it's exactly
as I remembered it.

381
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,253
I do want
to come back, Bart,

382
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,627
but it doesn't sound like
Flanders is gonna get fired.

383
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,006
Oh, I think
I could get him fired.

384
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,803
I got you fired, didn't I?

385
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,047
(laughing)

386
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,598
Yes.

387
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,811
Now, you realize if
I become principal again,

388
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,943
we can no longer be friends,

389
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,730
unless you become
a good student.

390
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,653
Hmm. That's probably
never gonna happen.

391
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,283
Well, we'll always
have the Laundromat.

392
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,571
Yeah.

393
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,288
What's he doing here?

394
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,699
{\an8}Well, once he found out
we were gonna get

395
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,707
{\an8}Ned Flanders fired,
he insisted on helping.

396
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,830
That is true.

397
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,167
Here's the plan.

398
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,591
Once Chalmers comes for his
next inspection

399
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,709
and sees how crappy
the school has gotten,

400
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,046
he'll fire Ned on the spot.

401
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,012
Uh, one question remains:
How do I get out of the army?

402
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,893
<i>No problemo.</i> Just make a pass
at your commanding officer.

403
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,721
Done and done.
And I mean done.

404
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,227
(knocking)

405
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,309
MARGE:
What's going on in there?

406
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,603
ALL:
Nothing.

407
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,271
(students shouting)

408
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,898
(singing opera)

409
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,696
Come on, Chalmie. You fired
Skinner for less than this.

410
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,161
Yeah, I did, but Skinner
really bugged me.

411
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,503
Besides, the way America's
public schools are sliding,

412
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,408
they'll all be this way
in a few months.

413
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,667
I say lay back and enjoy it.
It's a hell of a toboggan ride.

414
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,210
{\an8}NED:<i> Well, cockilly-doodilly-do,</i>
<i>little buddies.</i>

415
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:58,514
<i>Let's thank the Lord for</i>
<i>another beautiful school day.</i>

416
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,720
Thank the Lor-- Thank the Lord?
That sounded like a prayer.

417
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,643
A prayer! A prayer
in a public school!

418
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,353
God has no place
within these walls,

419
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,194
just like facts have no place
within organized religion!

420
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,941
Simpson, you get your wish.
Flanders is history.

421
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,824
(humming)

422
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,112
Well, I really enjoyed my
time here, Superintendent.

423
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,777
May the Lord
bless and keep you.

424
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,616
Yeah, take it outside,
God boy.

425
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,412
Okilly-dokilly.

426
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,955
Dirksen, tuck in your shirt.
Jaffee, spit out that gum.

427
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,709
You really think it's a good idea
to give that freak his job back?

428
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,843
Ah, he seems to know
the students' names.

429
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,255
So, I guess
we're enemies again.

430
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,391
I guess.

431
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,428
Thanks, Bart.

432
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,311
Sure.

433
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:53,056
(chuckles)

434
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,185
(Skinner chuckles)

435
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,572
Oh, mercy.

436
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,319
{\an8}♪♪

437
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,319
Shh.
