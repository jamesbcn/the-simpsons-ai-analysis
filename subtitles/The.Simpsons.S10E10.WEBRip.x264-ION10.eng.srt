Social Security checks built

Did you or did you not use

108

a senior citizen discount card
at said car wash?

109
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,591
Well, I did, but--

110

(gasping)

112
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:07,434
...but it seems to me
that a senior citizen has to be over 55.

Isn't that so?

00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,516

Listen, folks. There's no magic formula.

134
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,598
-then blamed it on the dog?
-Huh?

135
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,851
You've never licked maple syrup off
your lover's stomach?

No, no, and double no!

Well, you may be a bit cautious,
but what's wrong with that?

149
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,547
Some people like chunky peanut butter,

150
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,054
-some like smooth.
-Mm-hmm.

151
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,095

152

00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,028
(laughing)

180
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,776
OK, no more gasoline.

181
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,948
Hmm.

182
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,245
(Homer humming)

183
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,245
Full power!

184
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,339
Never a dull moment, huh, Homer?

185
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,419
You got that right.

186
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,753
Throw on the mesquite, Bart.

187
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,168
Mesquite it is!

188
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,801
Here, this may sound
just a teensy bit insane

189
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,307
in the old membrane, Homer,

190
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,178
but I was wondering if you could show me
how to have some fun.

191
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,636
Well, well, well. So, Flawless Flanders

192
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,148
needs help from Stinky-pants Simpson.

193
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,980
(laughs) Yeah, I guess I do.

194
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,975
Welly, welly, welly...

195
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,487
Mr. Clean wants to hang
with Dirty Dingus Magee.

196
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,661
How about it, Homer?

197
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,779
Will you teach me the secret
of your intoxicating lust for life?

198
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,987
Wellity, wellity, wellity...

199
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:15,997
Stop that!

200
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,538
Will you help me or not?

201
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,996
-(can clanking)
-Let's do it.

202
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,922
-(Homer groans)
-So, what about all this meat?

203
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,802
Ah, the missus will clean that up.

204
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,259
Now it's Marge's time to shine.

205
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,425
First of all,
I get five dollars a day plus expenses.

206
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,511
Seems fair.

207
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,425
And I'll need your signature here...

208
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,515
here...

209
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,809
and... initial here.

210
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,806
Ha. You're not really giving my father
power of attorney, are you?

211
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,068
Of course, I... (gasps)

212
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,859
Oh, my stars! I can't do that.

213
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,783
Well, that's unfortunate.

214
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,861
It really is.

215
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,906
(sighs)

216
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:51,908
All right.

217
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,867
Congratulations.

218
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,740
Welcome to the Homer Simpson Program.

219
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,623
So, what happens next?

220
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,624
One day soon, I will come for you...

221
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,286
and then the game will begin.

222
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,625
Could be in the middle of the night.

223
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,878
It could be when you least expect it.

224
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,166
Or whatever's good for you. I don't care.

225
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,966
OK, Homer,

226
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,930
I'm ready to learn.

227
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:12,929
What's the first lesson?

228
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,220
Just give me the topic sentence.

229
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:16,968
Give me that!

230
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,176
That's your problem.

231
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,016
You're living up here.

232
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,941
You got to live down here...

233
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,271
in the impulse zone.

234
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,105
If you want to be like me,
you got to make snap decisions.

235
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,191
Like this.

236
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,686
-(tires screeching)
-MAN: Oh!

237
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,607
We're going to break the bank

238
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,279
at the Monty Burns' Casino!

239
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,986
Homer, they blew that up yesterday.

240
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,156
HOMER: Oh, yeah. Right.

241
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,414
-(Homer gasps)
-(Ned screams)

242
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,865
Then we're going to Las Vegas.

243
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,291
Which is actually back in that direction.

244
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,955
-(exclaims)
-(man screams)

245
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,472
<i>♪ Nobody's gonna take my Ned ♪</i>

246
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,299
<i>♪ Gonna teach him to have fu-un ♪</i>

247
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,885
<i>♪ Oh, he's a Flanders machine ♪</i>

248
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,636
That sure was a fun trip to Las Vegas.

249
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,435
Uh, too many kids.

250
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,482
Ooh, it's going on 8:30.

251
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,395
I'd better call Maude
and tell her where I am.

252
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,362
Relax. I called her from the gas station.

253
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,276
Thanks, buddy.

254
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,362
(chortling)

255
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,447
Sucker.

256
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,498
(upbeat music playing)

257
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,308
Oh, gee, Homer, this all looks so garish.

258
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,896
-(elephant trumpeting)
-(lion roaring)

259
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,111
(gorilla shrieking)

260
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,151
Oh! The lights, the noise,
the letter "X"...

261
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,605
It's-it's all designed
to inflame the senses!

262
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,026
I'm overstimulated.

263
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,534
I've got to get out of this town.

264
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,276
I don't think so.

265
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,158
I think you'll find
escape is quite impossible.

266
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,366
No, I got it.

267
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,998
Oh. Oh. Would you like
to be in the audience

268
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,174
for my infomercial?

269
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,171
(screaming)

270
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,587
Help me! My daughter's not talented!

271
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,926
(groans)

272
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,220
(tires screeching)

273
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,219
(people cheering)

274
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,097
Hey! Lance Murdock!

275
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,521
{\an8}(engine revving)

276
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,523
If he's not careful

277
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,614
his scooter could roll
right down that ramp.

278
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,110
He's a daredevil, Ned.

279
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,611
He laughs at death.

280
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,193
Huh! When I want to laugh

281
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,607
I'll take Bob Saget, thank you very much.

282
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,487
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now</i>
<i>the indestructible Lance Murdock</i>

283
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,664
<i>will jump his SuiCycle</i>
<i>over an audience member.</i>

284
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:50,415
<i>And he'll do it while attempting</i>
<i>to open a locked safe on his head.</i>

285
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,998
<i>Any volunteers?</i>

286
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,667
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Pick him, pick him!

287
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,085
Now, Homer, no!

288
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,553
I want to do something exciting,

289
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,593
but I can't just go
from zero to 30 like that.

290
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,968
I could be killed.

291
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,564
Fine. I'll do it.

292
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,769
Where do you want me?

293
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,729
On the "X."

294
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,229
(SuiCycle engine revving)

295
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,400
You mean the one with the red paint?

296
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,516
Uh, yeah, paint.

297
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,316
Now, it's of critical importance
that you don't--

298
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,151
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll figure it out.

299
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,816
This isn't rocket science.

300
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,124
Well, actually, there are several rockets
mounted to the--

301
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,369
Boring.

302
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,788
-(drumroll)
-(crowd chattering excitedly)

303
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,964
(engine roaring)

304
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,881
ANNOUNCER: <i>OK, he's cleared</i>
<i>the ring of fire...</i>

305
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,876
<i>past the ring of ice...</i>

306
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,223
<i>over the dog-doo stick...</i>

307
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,339
<i>He's cracked the safe...</i>

308
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,296
Hey, Flanders, don't spill my beer.

309
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,296
Oh, God, lay down!

310
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,467
Lay down!

311
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,215
(Lance screaming)

312
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,641
Clear!

313
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,806
(buzzing)

314
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,104
<i>He's all right, folks!</i>

315
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,478
(crowd cheering)

316
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,355
Okeydoke, let's hit the tables.

317
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,856
Oh, my God, Homer,
watching you risk your life

318
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,815
turned my beat box
all the way up to rumba.

319
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,407
Yeah, I was praying you'd be safe,

320
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,202
but t-to be honest, a part of me
wanted to see you get splattered.

321
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,707
Oh, I see someone just had

322
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,000
-his first taste of bloodlust.
-Huh.

323
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,630
Let's see, what's Marge's birthday?

324
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,092
Barney's is July 15, same as Lassie's,

325
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,223
so Marge must be 50... Oh, forget it.

326
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,841
Flanders, what's your birthday?

327
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,468
No, leave me out of this, Homer.

328
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,314
Games of chance are strictly forbidden
by Deuteronomy 7...

329
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,890
Seven, eh?

330
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,524
DEALER: Seven a winner.

331
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,435
-Way to go, Flanders!
-(gasps)

332
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,444
The Bible's finally pulling its weight.

333
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,026
Got any more holy numbers?

334
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,820
Oh, I got a bunch, Homer, but...

335
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,114
I just don't feel right.

336
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,450
Oh, Lord, what should I do?

337
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,195
DEEP VOICE: <i>Keep gaming.</i>

338
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,246
What?

339
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,119
It means gambling.

340
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,866
Keep gambling.

341
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,998
Oh. Righty-o.

342
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,876
One betting disk, please.

343
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,131
"One betting disk, please."

344
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,553
Watch and learn.

345
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,010
And 14 black.

346
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,966
Well, there you go.

347
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,724
-Now, how about a drink?
-(exclaims)

348
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,515
How do you do it, Homer?

349
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,311
How do you silence that little voice
that says "think"?

350
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,397
You mean Lisa?

351
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,481
Oh, no. I mean common sense.

352
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,687
Oh, that.

353
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,106
That can be treated
with our good friend alcohol.

354
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,605
You might want to write that down.

355
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,697
Where the hell's your notebook?

356
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,321
-You threw it out the--
-Never mind.

357
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,118
Just pay attention. Slave girl?

358
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,951
Oh, slave girl?

359
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,746
More libations, my imperial conquerors?

360
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,621
-What?
-More booze.

361
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,958
Oh, yeah.

362
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,712
Two more of these, please.

363
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,253
And for you, Ned?

364
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,007
I'll have a Shirley...

365
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,759
No, a Virgin...

366
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,221
No, make it a children's...

367
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,386
Oh! What the heck.

368
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,889
You only live once.

369
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,391
Give me a...

370
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,352
(echoing) White Wine Spritzer!

371
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,609
(Homer snoring)

372
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,946
(groans)

373
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,073
Oh, my goodness, Homer. Ugh.

374
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,528
Wake up.

375
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,870
(incoherent mumbling)

376
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,213
Oh. Look at this place.

377
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,169
We must've really
painted the town last night.

378
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,500
I have a pounding headache,
my mouth tastes like vomit

379
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,257
and I don't remember a thing.

380
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,169
Welcome to my world.

381
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,087
Oh, I did it!

382
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,886
I conquered my fears
and I made up for a lot of lost living.

383
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,271
And I owe it all
to the Homer Simpson Program.

384
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,269
The what, now?

385
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,850
WOMAN: Well, it's about time
you two woke up.

386
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,476
Well, of course... (screams)

387
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,562
Who are you?

388
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,897
Who am I?

389
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,939
I'm Mrs. Ned Flanders.

390
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,026
(gasps)

391
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,360
(laughing)

392
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,525
Hey, smooth move, Flanders.

393
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,284
And I'm Mrs. Homer Simpson.

394
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,867
(screams)

395
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,119
-Here comes that vomit again.
-Ew.

396
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,793
HOMER: OK.

397
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,337
OK. OK. OK.

398
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,671
OK. OK.

399
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,894
OK.

400
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,469
OK, you're saying that
Ned and me married you two.

401
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,354
Oh, yeah. We're hitched, all right.

402
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,601
Till death do us part.

403
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,984
Mm-hmm. I'm working on that.

404
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,980
Ned, no!

405
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,271
Think of your wives!

406
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Wait a minute.

407
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,154
This could be some kind of scam
or possibly scamola.

408
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,494
We would remember if we got married.

409
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,319
Boy, you did have a lot to drink
last night, Homeo.

410
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,827
Take a look at this.

411
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,328
HOMER: Aw. "Precious Memories."

412
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:41,745
<i>"I okilly-dokilly, schmokilly" do.</i>

413
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,924
<i>And do you, Homer, take</i>
<i>this cocktail waitress you just met</i>

414
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,594
<i>to be your lawfully-wedded wife?</i>

415
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,172
<i>What did you call me?</i>

416
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,547
(sighs) <i>Do you want</i>
<i>to get married? Married?</i>

417
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,845
(imitating Sinatra)
<i>Sure. Sock it to me, baby!</i>

418
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,524
<i>By the power vested in me</i>
<i>by the Chicago Outfit,</i>

419
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,389

420
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,767
(smooching)

421
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,943
We are so dead.

422
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,815
Ladies, we want to do the honorable thing.

423
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,572
So, breakfast is on us
with full waffle bar privileges.

424
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,366
But first, I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

425
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,041
(dramatic sigh)

426
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,539
The waffle bar is closed.

427
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,790
I'm sorry, I'm so very...

428
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,632
Homer! The bad news, ladies,
is we already have wives.

429
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,419
Well, you can't be very happy with them
if you married us.

430
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,594
You two fellas are the nicest husbands
we've ever had

431
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,514
and we're not giving you up
without a fight.

432
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,513
But, Ginger, honey,
I am not the catch I appear to be.

433
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,927
Ginger's my wife.

434
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,175
Are you sure?

435
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,386
Oh, rats.

436
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,893
No offense, sweetie.

437
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:47,067
Homer, why don't we go make
the girls some custom omelets?

438
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,072
Geez, I've never seen anyone
so whipped so fast.

439
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,203
(imitates whip cracking)

440
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,368
(frantic groaning)

441
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,739
What are we going to do, Homer?

442
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,655
My kids are going to be traumatized.

443
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,371
And then there's Maude.

444
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,004
And then there's Maude!

445
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,121
I don't know, Flanders.

446
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,207
Having two wives
could have its advantages.

447
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:12,592
Chop, chop, dig, dig,
chop, chop, dig, dig,

448
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,594
chop, chop, dig, dig...

449
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:20,056
You know, Homie, there's so much more
two wives could do for you.

450
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,850
I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping.

451
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,515

452
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,733

Ow! That sting hurt so much.

456
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,953
We got to get out of this, Ned.

457
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,069
Well, do something.

458
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,815
This is all your fault.

459
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,367
You and your stupid program.

460
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,540
Blame me if you must,

461
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,498
but don't ever speak ill of the program.

462
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,498
The program is rock solid.

463
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,749
The program is sound.

464
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,922
{\an8}Yoo-hoo!

465
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,959

467
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,165
Oh. How are we gonna get out of this mess

468
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,416
in an honorable and decent...

469
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,008
Oh, nuts!

470
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,433
I don't know.

471
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,351
Omelets have a lot of fat in them.

472
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,139
Forget it. You're married.

473
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,523

All right, let's get our stories straight
for Marge and Maude.

537
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,333
We were out buying them fabulous gifts...

538
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,412
What's the occasion?

539
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,206
Because we love them, jackass.

540
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,380
Anyhoo, we come out of Walmart,
when suddenly 100 spaceships...

541
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,170
-Homer!
-You're right, you're right.

542
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,514
Fifty spaceships beamed us aboard.

543
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,299
They gang-probed you
while I discovered an invention

544
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,264
that blew their heads up
and saved America.

545
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,814
Uh, do I have to be gang-probed?

546
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,598
Would you rather tell Maude the truth?

547
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,682
(Ned sighing)

548
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,136
What did the aliens look like?

549
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,806
Well, I only saw them from the back

550
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,864
'cause they were so busy gang-probing you.

551
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,108
HOMER: Well, hello, little birdie.

552
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,939
-(vultures squawking angrily)
-(Homer and Ned yelling)

553
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,985
HOMER: Oh, my eyes! Cover your eyes!

554
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,488
