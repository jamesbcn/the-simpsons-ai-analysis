00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,303
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,810
(bell ringing)

4
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,283
(whistle blows)

5
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,316
(beeping)

00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,199
(playing the blues)

7
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,513
(tires screech)

8
00:00:58,975 --> 00:00:59,885
(honking)

9
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,074
D-oh! (screams)

10
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,903
(tires screeching)

11
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,912
MARGE: Mmm.

12
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,626
{\an8}Mmm... good pancakes, Mom.

13
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,051
{\an8}Well, thank you, honey.

14
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,169
{\an8}They come in a squeeze bottle now.

15
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,045
{\an8}-(flatulating noise)
-Ooh! (scoffs)

16
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,894
{\an8}I better put on the silencer.

17
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,467
{\an8}(muted flatulating)

18
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,015
{\an8}You know what would be good with these

19
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,231
{\an8}is some Ms. Butterworth.

20
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,388
{\an8}Let's have a breakfast meeting.

21
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,848
{\an8}Eww!

22
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,318
{\an8}How long has this baking soda
been in here?

23
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,398
{\an8}I don't know. It came with the house.

24
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,901
{\an8}Hey, Dad, bet you five bucks
you can't eat the whole box.

25
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,067
{\an8}Five? Why don't we make it $50?

26
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,117
{\an8}(laughing) You're going to regret this.

27
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,035
{\an8}I'll call Poison Control.

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,208
{\an8}Fran? It's me.

29
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,369
{\an8}Just a heads-up.

30
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,542
{\an8}Wow... (sniffing)

31
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,087
{\an8}The absorbed odors of a million meals.

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,180
{\an8}Oh, so many flavors.

33
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,394
{\an8}All those tasty memories flooding back...

34
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,970
{\an8}(gasping)

35
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,846
{\an8}MAN: <i>If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.</i>

36
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,857
{\an8}RICHARD NIXON: <i>Therefore, I shall resign</i>
<i>the Presidency...</i>

37
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,822
{\an8}NEIL ARMSTRONG: <i>That's one small step</i>
<i>for man...</i>

38
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,701
{\an8}<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

39
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,526
{\an8}(giggling)

40
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,528
{\an8}Uh-oh.

41
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,617
{\an8}Dad's having an antacid trip.

42
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,413
{\an8}And I won 50 bucks.

43
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,995
{\an8}Can I see the 50, Bart?

44
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,463
{\an8}Can I? Huh?

45
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,673
{\an8}Milhouse, my friend

46
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,462
{\an8}you and I are going on a spending spree.

47
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,457
{\an8}My doctor says

48
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,548
{\an8}I'm not supposed to go on sprees.

49
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,933
{\an8}What about jags?

50
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,050
{\an8}Jags are fine.

51
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,466
{\an8}Wonderful.

52
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,557
{\an8}-(clearing throat)
-A $50 bill!

53
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,058
{\an8}Gentlemen...

54
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,227
{\an8}let us shop.

55
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,855
{\an8}Our wide variety of gum

56
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,571
{\an8}comes in both stick and ball.

57
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,241
{\an8}I'm not really about gum

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,910
{\an8}but I like the whole chewing thing.

59
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,698
{\an8}Are you averse to crispy centers, sir?

60
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,081
{\an8}-Not at all.
-Then we have much to discuss.

61
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,945
{\an8}Oh... too much raw bacon.

62
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,331
{\an8}Come on, Bart.

63
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,084
{\an8}We can't stop spending now.

64
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,126
{\an8}There's one thing
I've always wanted to do.

65
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,882
{\an8}My Mom doesn't believe in fabric softener,

66
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,295
{\an8}but <i>she's </i>not around.

67
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,428
{\an8}I'm picking the next thing.

68
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,601
{\an8}It looks like we're down
to our last ten bucks.

69
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,768
{\an8}Hello.

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,770
{\an8}Radioactive Man number 1000, please.

71
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,896
{\an8}Ten dollars? I laugh at you.

72
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,110
{\an8}Please to note,
this is no ordinary comic book.

73
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,945
It is in Perma-Mint condition.

74
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,070
If you spill soda on it

75
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,576
the drops fly off harmlessly
onto lesser comics.

76
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,619
BOTH: Whoa!

77
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,121
Yes, you are quite correct to gasp.

78
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,163
Also note the price, $25.

79
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,748
We had to buy lunch for that homeless guy.

80
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,383
While my son's at fat camp

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,670
{\an8}I cleaned out his room.

82
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,423
{\an8}How much will you give me for this?

83
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,795
{\an8}Probably nothing, but let us see.

84
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,176
{\an8}Oh... handwritten script
for <i>Star Wars </i>by George Lucas?

85
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,723
{\an8}Princess Leia's anti-jiggle breast tape?

86
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,016
{\an8}Film reel labeled

87
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,139
{\an8}"Alternate Ending:
Luke's Father is Chewbacca"?

88
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,517
{\an8}Ooh! Ooh!

89
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,645
{\an8}I'll give you five dollars for the box.

90
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,560
Sold.

91
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,401
{\an8}Don't do it, lady.
That stuff's worth thousands.

92
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,315
{\an8}Yeah. He's ripping you off.

93
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,030
Well! If this is valuable

94
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,486
{\an8}then back to the leaky basement it goes.

95
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,536
Hmm!

96
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,156
Smile, please.

97
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,076
(shutter clicks)

98
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,163
Thank you.

99
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,922
(gasps)

100
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,628
Son, I know it hurts.

101
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,716
I still remember
my first lifetime banning.

102
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,506
(applauding)

103
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,805
(grunting) Oh!

104
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,055
Hey, where's my melon?

105
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,600
What the...

106
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,322
Ahh!

107
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,737
And you are banned for life

108
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,358
from all of my performances
and TV specials.

109
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,986
But I can still see your movies, right?

110
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:23,952
(grunts)

111
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,243
(crying)

112
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,999
And I never saw Gallagher again.

113
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,376
Ooh, it says here

114
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,673
that special effects whiz Tom Savini

115
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,377
is going to be appearing
at the comic book store tonight.

116
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,508
Tom Savini?

117
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,934
Yes. It says here

118
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,602
he's the movie magician behind <i>Creepshow</i>

119
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,891
<i>Friday the 13th, </i>and <i>Dawn of the Dead.</i>

120
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,731
{\an8}Oh... I can't believe
I'm going to miss that.

121
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,645
Don't worry your spiky little head.

122
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,031
I've got it all planned out.

123
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,488
{\an8}How could you have it planned out?

124
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,988
{\an8}You just heard about the problem.

125
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,610
You're right. Give me a minute.

126
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,158
Hmm...

127
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,658
Mr. Simpson, it hurts.

128
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,326
{\an8}Yeah, and why did we have to do this

129
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,674
{\an8}all the way from home?

130
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,669
For once in my life, I'm tall.

131
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,211
Don't take that away from me.

132
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,884
(affected voice) Hello...

133
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,222
I'm Shaquille O'Neal.

134
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,928
Let us in, please.

135
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,344
(all exclaiming)

136
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,756
You two are not welcome.

137
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,524
Sorry, son.

138
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,308
-Thanks for the tip-off.
-No problem.

139
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,689
Appearing exclusively here
at the Android's Dungeon...

140
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,692
Take that, Messieurs Barnes and Noble.

141
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,025
...the king of splatter, Tom Savini.

142
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,241
(applause)

143
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,914
Good evening.

144
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,908
(belches)

145
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,119
Sorry. I had a really big dinner.

146
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,280
Whoo! Dinner!

147
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,788
But I'm sure one more French fry
wouldn't hurt.

148
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,500
(groaning)

149
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,497
(cheers)

150
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,884
Oh, we missed "the gut-buster."

151
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,465
Yeah, that should be us
covered with blood.

152
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,427
Sure, computer technology is here to stay

153
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,723
but there'll always be a place

154
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,056
for the practical special effects wizard.

155
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,895
(cheering)

156
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,730
I love the theater.

157
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,015
Oh, please.

158
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,028
I saw Paul Lynde

159
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,449
do that same hackneyed trick on <i>Bewitched.</i>

160
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,531
Try to explode this out of my belly.

161
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,655
That's not a cookie.

162
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,329
[exclaiming)

163
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,500
That's a time-release blood pack.

164
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,159
(groaning)

165
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,037
You, sir, are a perfect patsy.

166
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,504
Let me shake your hand.

167
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,093
Ugh. To the gag, I will give a D-plus.

168
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,261
As for the workmanship on the hand...

169
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,629
Ooh...

170
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,086
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

171
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,636
That's not right.

172
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,599
(all laughing)

173
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,009
You mocking me.

174
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,347
Oh, that is rich.

175
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,602
(groaning)

176
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,353
(laughing continues)

177
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,151
Stop your laughing!

178
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,269
You're all banned!

179
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,765
Banned, I tell you!

180
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,567
Ooh... Breath... short

181
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,613
left arm... numb.

182
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,321
Can't go on...

183
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,617
describing symptoms much longer.

184
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,121
(groaning)

185
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:18,959
(gasps)

186
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,630
I think he's had a heart attack.

187
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,918
(all gasping)

188
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,919
Young man, you've had what we call

189
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,797
a "cardiac episode."

190
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,144
Worst... episode... ever.

191
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,350
Oh, not even close.

192
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,560
If these boys hadn't called 911

193
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,521
I'd be wearing that watch right now.

194
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,271
(laughing) I'm just kidding.

195
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,733
{\an8}But you would be dead.

196
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,652
You saved my life?

197
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,781
Yeah, after you were so mean to us.

198
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,320
So now we're even.

199
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,451
{\an8}My prognosis... or is it diagnosis?

200
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,490
{\an8}Whichever. You need to avoid stress.

201
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,374
{\an8}Now, what kind of work do you do?

202
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,951
I run a comic book store.

203
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,831
Oh, dear Lord!

204
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,583
We call that profession "The Widowmaker."

205
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,375
{\an8}Or we would, if any of
the proprietors were married.

206
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,749
{\an8}You should close down
the store for a while.

207
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,007
But I'd lose all my business
to Frodo's of Shelbyville.

208
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,930
{\an8}Well, then get a friend to run it for you.

209
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,853
You... do have friends, don't you?

210
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,849
Well, the Superfriends.

211
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,931
You should get some friends

212
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,385
who aren't printed on paper.

213
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,055
What? You mean action figures?

214
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,773
We'll run the store for you.

215
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,613
Two ten-year-olds running my store?

216
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,190
W--what is this? Bizarro World?

217
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,567
Calm down.

218
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,823
Don't make me put a dog heart in there.

219
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,487
Can you believe it, Bart?

220
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,907
We're actually running a comic book store.

221
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,456
Looks like our lifetime ban just expired.

222
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,586
(alarm blaring)

223
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,958
Sorry. Sorry.

224
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,168
OK, here's Comic Book Guy's instructions,

225
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,006
"A carton of malted milk balls

226
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,181
"one box confectioner's sugar

227
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,430
a can of chocolate frosting..."

228
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,012
That's just his shopping list.

229
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,967
{\an8}No, it's his instructions.

230
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,437
Well, we're going to make
some changes around here.

231
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,558
This store is going to be run by kids

232
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,685
and for kids.

233
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,861
You said it, partner.

234
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,645
Oh, nice to see you.

235
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,447
Hey, how about that <i>Bloodzilla?</i>

236
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,822
(laughing)

237
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,156
<i>Vampire Dinosaur.</i>

238
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,913
Oh... you can't make that stuff up.

239
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,624
<i>The Death of Sad Sack.</i>

240
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,174
This better not be another fake-out.

241
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,082
Uh-uh. You've got to be 40 inches tall

242
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,378
for the adult section.

243
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,131
Please!

244
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,126
OK, but get on your tippy-toes.

245
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,183
Everybody's hugging.

246
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,016
Hey, Bart, I finished

247
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,519
organizing the stockroom.

248
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,851
Mark down the Poochie crap.

249
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,345
Then unstick all the Supergirls.

250
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,359
You know, if we're partners,
maybe you should do some of the work.

251
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,231
Less barking, more marking.

252
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,278
Yes, sir, partner.

253
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,072
(exit bell rings)

254
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,276
Hmm.

255
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,286
Now, when you've got
a bum ticker like we do

256
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,539
you need all the friends you can get.

257
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,791
And Moe's is the friendliest
place in the Rum District.

258
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,920
Get out and take your
Sacajawea dollars with you.

259
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,174
I'll give you till three.

260
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,415
One...

261
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,177
(body thuds)

262
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,758
Hey, Homer, who's the manatee?

263
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,103
(patrons laughing)

264
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,103
Oh, now be nice, Moe.

265
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,641
This guy just got out of the hospital.

266
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,064
Oh, sorry. Let me buy you a drink.

267
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,063
Very well.

268
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,863
I will have a shot of cranberry schnapps.

269
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,649
Uh, these, uh...
they're just painted on there.

270
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,704
Your choices are beer
and, uh, egg soakings.

271
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,819
I'll pass.

272
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,115
Beer is the nectar of the nitwit.

273
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,079
Hey... you knocking beer?

274
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,289
Nobody badmouths Duff.

275
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,418
Oh, piece of crap.

276
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,955
Come on. You're here to make friends.

277
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,382
Please, if I wanted to hear
mindless droning

278
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,461
I'd befriend an air conditioner.

279
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,627
Oh, now he's ragging on air conditioners.

280
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,966
Hey, they keep us cool in the summer, pal.

281
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,891
Get him!

282
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,891
And stay out!

283
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,597
Is there a word in Klingon
for "loneliness"?

284
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,106
Ah, yes.

285
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,186
<i>Garrlll dak!</i>

286
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,527
LISA: Milhouse, I'm impressed.

287
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,162
The store is so busy.

288
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,239
You and Bart are really great businessmen.

289
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,334
Well, I'm really the brains.

290
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,000
Bart's just the eye candy.

291
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,248
Hi. Eric Reynolds, Plan Nine Comics.

292
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,710
Is the manager here?

293
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,500
Well... I'm kind of the co-manager.

294
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,956
Tough break, Toots.

295
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,837
I need a man who answers to no one.

296
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,796
A full manager.

297
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,601
Hatchi-matchi!

298
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,604
{\an8}I can help you, sir.

299
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,693
{\an8}And I answer to no one.

300
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,729
Well, then, you'll want to stock up

301
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,276
on our new superhero.

302
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,281
{\an8}Would you say he's the <i>ultimate </i>superhero?

303
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,072
Oh, very ultimate indeed.

304
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,946
Point your peepers

305
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,283
at <i>Biclops.</i>

306
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,367
(gasps)

307
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,162
A superhero with glasses!

308
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,916
Oh, yeah, thick glasses...

309
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,168
kind of like yours.

310
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,495
So, how many do you need? 500? 600?

311
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,126
Six hundred sounds good.

312
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,923
Oh, that's too bad.

313
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,546
There's a price break at 1,000.

314
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,223
Oh, man.

315
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,475
{\an8}I'll take 2,000.

316
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,533
Human contact... the final frontier.

317
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,938
(sighing)

318
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,150
Out of the way, Tubby.

319
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,410
Oh, pardon me, "Oldie Hawn."

320
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,489
Wh... ah!

321
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,583
Why you ill-mannered sack of crap!

322
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
Oh, goody.

323
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,374
Now I know whatever happened to Baby Jane.

324
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,502
You are the rudest man who ever...

325
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,585
bought me dinner.

326
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,962
Correction. I do not believe

327
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,416
I have ever bought you... Oh.

328
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,257
(theme from <i>A Summer Place </i>playing)

329
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,483
So, how many issues of <i>Biclops</i>
would you like?

330
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,863
Biclops?

331
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,069
Who's his girlfriend? Lois Lame?

332
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,819
He's kinda afraid of girls.

333
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,565
Ah, it doesn't even smack good.

334
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,369
How could you spend all our money

335
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,948
on a comic book published by LensCrafters?

336
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,794
We'll never sell these.

337
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,660
Birds won't even use them in their nests.

338
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,206
(squawking)

339
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,713
(grumbling squawks)

340
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,592
OK. So I made <i>one </i>bad decision.

341
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,802
(sighing) It's my fault

342
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,262
for leaving you in charge.

343
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,391
Sometimes, I forget how young you are.

344
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,428
I'm only three months younger than you.

345
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,562
Oh, look, you're getting cranky.

346
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,099
You haven't had your juice.

347
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,442
Well, my straw broke off in the carton.

348
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,522
That's not the point!

349
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,484
We're supposed to be partners

350
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,694
and you're pushing me around

351
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,033
like a Playskool Corn Popper.

352
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,689
It's a vacuum cleaner, Milhouse.

353
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,607
Whatever! I demand respect!

354
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,237
I have feelings!

355
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,244
I'm a human boy!

356
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,366
Just like you!

357
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,623
(quietly) Shh. Use your indoor voice.

358
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,496
OK, that's it.

359
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,170
(groans)

360
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,133
(screaming)

361
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,096
(screaming)

362
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,773
En garde!

363
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,611
Oh!

364
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,820
(grunting with effort)

365
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,157
Eat watering can, partner!

366
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,243
(thudding)

367
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,083
Whoa!

368
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,456
Comic Book Guy's secret stash!

369
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,672
Look all these bootleg videos!

370
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,707
<i>Alien Autopsy.</i>

371
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,127
<i>Illegal Alien Autopsy.</i>

372
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,593
<i>Godfather III, </i>good version.

373
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,467
He's got the tape of Kent Brockman

374
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,683
picking his nose!

375
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,345
Look! He's picking his nose!

376
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,733
(clock ticking)

377
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,067
MRS. SKINNER: (flirty) I'll be right down!

378
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,823
I'm just putting on my witch hazel.

379
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,236
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

380
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,947
So, uh, your mother tells me

381
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,826
you go to Springfield Elementary.

382
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,673
Exactly what is your interest
in my mother?

383
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,129
She makes me laugh.

384
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,919
Here I come!

385
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,707
(loud squeaking)

386
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,835
(gasping) Good Lord,
Mother, I can see your...

387
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,258
figure.

388
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,467
{\an8}Oh, you see a lot more
when you do my daily mole check.

389
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,398
What I do for my allowance money
is nobody's business.

390
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,609
He's not nobody.

391
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,529
He might even be your new daddy.

392
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,526
(cackling)

393
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,738
(snickering)

394
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,951
(strangled gulp)

395
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,199
"Police informant tape"?

396
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,413
These are never supposed
to leave the station.

397
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,501
<i>I really hate to be a snitch.</i>

398
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,620
WIGGUM: <i>Don't worry.</i>

399
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,616
<i>Your yellow-bellied ratting will be held</i>

400
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,128
<i>in the strictest confidence.</i>

401
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,839
(sighs) <i>Well, in that case...</i>

402
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,553
<i>My neighbor Homer</i>
<i>released a radioactive ape in my house.</i>

403
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,511
<i>It's, uh, it's taken over</i>
<i>the whole top floor.</i>

404
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,263
It wasn't Dad's fault.

405
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,604
The ape tricked him.

406
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:36,889
What's next?

407
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,271
"Mr. Rogers drunk."

408
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,153
MR. ROGERS: <i>Well, what do you mean</i>

409
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,569
<i>I can't take off my sweater?</i>

410
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,359
(screaming) <i>I'm hot!</i>

411
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,452
You know, I'll bet kids
would pay to see this stuff.

412
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,568
We could have a midnight screening
right here in the store!

413
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,566
(gasps)

414
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,527
{\an8}That's actually a great idea, Milhouse.

415
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,738
{\an8}Really?

416
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,867
{\an8}Well, I was due.

417
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,868
I'll say... partner.

418
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,036
MARGE: So many restaurants.

419
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,127
Oh, I can't decide!

420
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,593
I throw myself on the mercy
of the food court.

421
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:18,264
{\an8}Um... I guess I'll have
the chicken tandoori.

422
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,097
And I'll have the beef Wellington.

423
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,193
{\an8}(buzzer beeping)

424
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,065
Oh, look at you two!

425
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,900
You look so couply.

426
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,105
Yes, we're a perfect match.

427
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,616
Her sneer just lights up my day.

428
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,408

finishing each other's insults.

Thank God there's only one of these a day.

438
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,482
Could it be any more orange?

439
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,938
(sighs contentedly)

440
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,988
I must warn you that
once this next tape starts

441
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,704
it will not stop,
because that button is broken.

442
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,996
Let's watch.

443
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,081

447
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,962
Got that right.

00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:33,956

Well, well, well...

more pirated tapes than a...

Well, that'll have to do.

Uh, these yours, son?

466
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,880
No, sir.

467
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,011
We're just exhibiting them
for profit without permission.

468
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,219
Fair enough.

469
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,839

00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,472

00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,943
Maybe there is room in my store
for romance comics.

476
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,395
Nobody'll buy those.

477
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,855
Your store smells.

478
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,815

It's OK, man.

484
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,542
If it doesn't affect you,
you're not human.

485
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,126
Uh, Comic Book Guy, you're under arrest

486
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,962

487
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,087

00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,429
They can't lock me up for long, Agnes.
