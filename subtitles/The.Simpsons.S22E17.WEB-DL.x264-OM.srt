1
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,386
D'oh!

2
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:09,441
Okay, going down the checklist:

3
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,298
<i>Feu allumé.</i>
<i>Oui.</i>

4
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,807
<i>Ballon gonflé. Oui.</i>

5
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,326
Now <i>enlevez le ballast!</i>

6
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:25,796
Commencing aerial inspection
of the plant.

7
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:27,948
Unflattering graffito...

8
00:01:30,502 --> 00:01:32,386
...neutralized.

9
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:34,788
Gadzooks!

10
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,674
The one hazard this balloon
cannot negotiate...

11
00:01:36,758 --> 00:01:38,392
a gentle breeze!

12
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:42,396
Help! Curtail my ascent!
Curtail it, I say!

13
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:44,365
Hey, Mr. Burns needs
our help!

14
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:47,251
Let's just shoot at him
and see what happens.

15
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,786
Good thing I went hunting
this morning.

16
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:50,187
Bagged me an elk.

17
00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:51,438
Hey, where'd it go?

18
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:55,226
Huh! I wonder
if that's the same elk.

19
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:59,964
Oh, I can't do it.

20
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,515
A balloon saved one
of my arteries.

21
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,817
It doesn't seem right
to kill his cousin.

22
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:05,903
Looks like it's up to me.

23
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,072
Let's see, target
at two o'clock.

24
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,607
Adjust for wind.

25
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:10,925
Just shoot already.

26
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:12,826
But I haven't finished
my rituals yet.

27
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:14,078
Mwa!

28
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:15,713
Mmm.

29
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:22,086
Help! I'm wafting on a zephyr!

30
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:36,450
That's just sick.

31
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:39,436
You stink!

32
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:41,272
Nice shooting, Annie Oakley!

33
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:44,275
If you were a biathlete,
I'd say "stick to skiing."

34
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,591
Simpson, your sharpened-shooting
has saved my life.

35
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,059
Name your reward.

36
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:04,395
Anything, just name it.

37
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:06,480
All your money
and all your stuff.

38
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:09,199
Lower and likelier.

39
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,252
Uh, Super Bowl tickets?

40
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,920
Playoff tickets?

41
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:14,755
Regular season, bobblehead day?

42
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,123
Nothing-head day!

43
00:03:18,426 --> 00:03:20,945
Wow! I know I lay down
in front of bulldozers

44
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:23,180
to stop this stadium
from being built,

45
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:26,283
but I have to admit,
it's pretty sweet.

46
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:28,185
It's so fancy:

47
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:31,755
sushi bars, a 60-screen
movie theater,

48
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:33,657
Museum of Tolerance.

49
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:37,428
Oh, man.
Oh, geez.

50
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,829
That made you think.

51
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,547
They, even have a day spa

52
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,633
staffed by former
All-Pro linemen.

53
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:45,452
You know, I wouldn't
have to do this

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,223
if I hadn't bought
a Ferrari a day for 22 seasons.

55
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,325
Flip over.

56
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:52,860
I once hosted
<i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

57
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,663
Once again, ladies and
gentlemen, Matchbox 20.

58
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,997
Who dat?

59
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:59,099
Ooh, they even have a zoo...

60
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,785
featuring all the NFL mascots.

61
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:12,746
This place even has
its own arts district

62
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:15,883
with football-hating
intellectuals!

63
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,287
We'll stay for one inning,
then we can go.

64
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:22,673
Well, this has been great.

65
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:25,292
We should get home soon...
the game's gonna be starting.

66
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:26,727
Homer, the game is right here.

67
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:30,731
Oh, that's right!

68
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:33,300
I hope you kids are enjoying
yourself today

69
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:36,420
because you and your children
will be paying for this place

70
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:38,906
long after the team moves
to another city.

71
00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:48,699
Ooh, the Fan Cam!

72
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,169
♪ Everybody dance now! ♪

73
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,845

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,109
Boo!

79
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:17,661
Come on, party pooper,
bust a move.

80
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,064
Eh. This song's
a little bossy for me.

81
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:23,233
Aw, come on, sourpuss.

82
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:24,535
Ticky, ticky,
tickle-tickle!

83
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,236
Stop it!

84
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:27,337
Tickle-tickle-too!

85
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:28,572
Cut it out!

86
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:30,357
Tickle-tickle-
who-wants-a-pickle?!

87
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:31,709
What does that mean?!

88
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:33,460
Homie, maybe you should stop.

89
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:35,295
We've talked
about the gray zone.

90
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:38,565
Marge, he's laughing.
That means he's happy.

91
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,751
Has the Joker
taught you nothing?

92
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,203
Quit it!

93
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,473
Knock it off!
Stop it!

94
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,609
Dad, this isn't funny!

95
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:55,115
The child has
wetted his trousers!

96
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:02,406
Dad, how could you do that?

97
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:05,008
The whole audience
saw me pee my pants!

98
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,777
Son, I'm really, really sorry.

99
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:08,979
Oh, I don't know if I can...

100
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,280
whoo!...

101
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:11,882
ever make it up to you.

102
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,450
I... whoo!...

103
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:15,052
but I sincerely...

104
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,620
whoo!

105
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:19,490
Homer! Just because everyone
else is doing the wave

106
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,525
doesn't mean you have to.

107
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:22,726
No one else is doing it.

108
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:23,794
I'm trying to start it.

109
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:25,262
Whoo!

110
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,764
Whoo!

111
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,429
Taking pity on the boy, the
operators of Springfield Stadium

112
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,298
opened the stadium's
retractable roof

113
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,366
in an attempt to dry his pants.

114
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,168
Unfortunately,
the stain was picked up

115
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,571
by Russian spy satellites,
and President Dmitry Medvedev

116
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,490
has taken the pants-wetting
as a sign of American weakness.

117
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,159
A Russian flotilla has just
entered New York harb...

118
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:53,463
Oh. Bart's never gonna forgive
me for humiliating him.

119
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:55,574
And I wouldn't blame him.

120
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,542
You've destroyed our
son's self-esteem.

121
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:59,343
Well, it was <i>your</i> idea

122
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:01,746
to give him self-esteem
in the first place.

123
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:03,481
I told you you should've
stopped the tickling.

124
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,216
Now I have towork overtime.
What?!

125
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:07,301
Just to counteract
the self-confidence...

126
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:10,137
Hey Bart, I hear
the forecast is for showers...

127
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,272
in your pants!

128
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,274
I'm on a European vacation,

129
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,376
but "you're a-peein'"
everywhere!

130
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:17,178
<i>Oui, oui!</i>

131
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:24,151
Oh. Why did I agree
to moderate this teleconference?

132
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,304
You can't let this
go without using it

133
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:29,140
as a chance
to improve your fathering.

134
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,708
Well, of course,

135
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:33,477
I would <i>love</i> to be
a more sensitive father.

136
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:35,012
You know that.

137
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,481
That's great!
Then you won't mind me

138
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:39,817
enrolling you
in a fathering class.

139
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:41,819
I'd like to see you
thumb through

140
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,355
an extension school catalog
and find one.

141
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:46,741
Here's one right here.

142
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:48,876
Please, Marge, <i>no.</i>

143
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:51,112
The other negligent dads
will make fun of me.

144
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,847
They're so cliquey.

145
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,148
You'll be fine.

146
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,783
You always are.

147
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,787
Oh, I miss my friends
from drunk driving school.

148
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,723
They were so cool.

149
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:12,199
Homer, welcome to Fresh Start,

150
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:14,201
a fathering enrichment class.

151
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,137
My name is Dr. Zander.

152
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,673
Last week we assigned everyone
to keep a fathering journal.

153
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,675
Gerald, would you like
to share your entries?

154
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,643
Absolutely, Dr. Zander.

155
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,863
"Monday: left work early
to see Derek's baseball game.

156
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:28,266
"When Derek saw me
in the stands,

157
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,701
"his smile was worth
a million dollars.

158
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,703
"Tuesday:
Lost a million-dollar account

159
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:34,939
because I left work
early Monday."

160
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:36,724
That's great journaling.
Comments?

161
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,161
Uh, Homer, it says here

162
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,063
you've been a father
for ten years.

163
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,599
What has that taught you?
Well, for one thing,

164
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,801
you're never really
ready to be a father.

165
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,369
But... oh, you know,

166
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:50,271
the other day, Bart,
the little dickens,

167
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,473
said I had an elephant butt.

168
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,476
So anyway, I'm strangling him,
and I said to Bart...

169
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:57,128
Wait. H-Hold on a moment.

170
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,629
You were strangling your son?

171
00:08:58,697 --> 00:08:59,964
Yeah, strangling.

172
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:01,766
I mean, it's not the <i>only</i> tool

173
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,784
in my parenting toolbox, but...

174
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:04,986
it's the sharpest.

175
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,772
Right?

176
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,207
Anyway, I said "Bart..."

177
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:12,043
You're actually serious?

178
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,378
You physically lay your hands
on your boy's neck?

179
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:17,999
Well, yeah, I... I guess
it's just how <i>I</i> was raised.

180
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,350
Look at these grades!

181
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:20,651
They're a disgrace!

182
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,119
No TV for a week!

183
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,787
Why, you little...

184
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:34,048
So, are those butter cookies
for everybody, or?

185
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,817
Um... why don't we stop there
for today,

186
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:39,153
and I'll see you next week.

187
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:42,089
Who do you have next period?

188
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:46,961
Hey, Doc.

189
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,562
Where is everybody?

190
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,097
I told them not to come.

191
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:52,533
Why didn't you tell <i>me</i>
not to come?

192
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:55,636
Homer, to emphasize the
seriousness of this situation,

193
00:09:55,704 --> 00:10:00,007
I'm going to turn my chair
around backwards.

194
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,859
I feel...

195
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:03,661
in this situation,

196
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,997
the only option is a risky
and radical treatment.

197
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,999
Homer, meet Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar.

198
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,536
Dr. Zander and I play pick-up
basketball on the weekend.

199
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:15,306
And when he told me
what you do to your son,

200
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:19,043
I was so disturbed
I only scored 172 points.

201
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,746
I had 86 assists.

202
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:24,815
But today he's here
to <i>assist</i> me with you.

203
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:29,991
Hey, what...
wh-what are you doing?

204
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:32,046
Homer, it's time you understood
what it feels like

205
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:34,164
to be young,
small and terrified.

206
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,833
No, Doc, please.

207
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:38,685
I'm just a little boy.

208
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:39,786
Why, you little...

209
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,425
I don't want to hurt him, Doc.

210
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:47,394
You have a good heart, Kareem.

211
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:51,298
Which is why you're the only Laker
I could trust with this task.

212
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,469
Uh, not a good time
to water the plants?

213
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:56,803
No, it's fine.

214
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,189
Hey, Kareem,

215
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:01,608
what do you think
about today's selfish players?

216
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:05,345
Ball-hogging,
tattooed...

217
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:08,765
♪ No more Mr. Nice Guy ♪

218
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,669
♪ No more Mr. Cle-e-e-ean ♪

219
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,772
♪ No more Mr. Nice Guy ♪

220
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,043
♪ They say, he sick,
he's obsce-e-e-ene ♪

221
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:33,473
Dr. Zander, you made me see
my life through Bart's neck,

222
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:38,011
and I swear, I will never,
ever strangle my boy again.

223
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,080
I believe we've made
excellent progress here today,

224
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:41,882
and after another few years

225
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:43,383
of twice-weekly sessions,
we can really...

226
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:47,054
Um, I, uh, lied about having
health insurance.

227
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:48,855
And you're cured.

228
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,169
Hello, boy.
Homer.

229
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:59,023
I want you to know I'm cured.

230
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:00,907
Good for you.
No more drinking?

231
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:03,109
Oh, son.
I can't quit drinking

232
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:05,811
any more than I could quit being
a man.

233
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,079
Oh.

234
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:08,848
Now it feels like morning.

235
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:12,318
What I am cured of is the
blind rage that has soured

236
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:14,921
our otherwise storybook
relationship.

237
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:17,256
Go ahead, just
try to provoke me.

238
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:19,892
I just got up, man.

239
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,995
Oh, come on. Bust
your daddy's chops.

240
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,730
Fine.

241
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:28,968
Why, you little...!

242
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:29,952
I'll teach you to...

243
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,370
I'm in your head, man.

244
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:35,258
Why, you...
I'm gonna...

245
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:37,009
Maybe this time...

246
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:44,150
Aw. My son's
first stroke.

247
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:45,551
Say...

248
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:49,405
"Cheese."

249
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,407
Can't hurt the boy.
Can't hurt the boy.

250
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:53,442
What the ...?!

251
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,278
Boy, get down from there.

252
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,813
Okay.
First, I'll send down my shoes.

253
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,365
All right.

254
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,983
Why, you little...!

255
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,087
Oh, come on.
Now you're a tree?

256
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:22,204
Bart Simpson.

257
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:24,573
What would your father say
if he knew what you were doing?

258
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:28,878
He'd say, "I'm a grown man
who's scared of my own son."

259
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:30,780
I find that hard to believe.

260
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:32,615
Oh, yeah? Look.

261
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:36,218
How many more, sir?

262
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,487
Fill the board,
then wash my car.

263
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:40,573
These are my keys.

264
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,574
What was that?

265
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,209
I-I said,

266
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:46,762
"My keister is ready
for a whooping, sir."

267
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:05,748
No. No. I'm just a kid.

268
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:07,266
Leave me alone.

269
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,254
It's "A-B-C, one, two, three!"

270
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:13,622
It's the easiest
song in the world!

271
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:20,863
You think you're better
than the Great Simpsini?

272
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,681
Well, you're not.

273
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:25,184
What are you gonna do,
write a book about me?

274
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:27,553
You couldn't get
in the door of Random House

275
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,655
if your name was
Bennett Cerf III.

276
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,109
One, two, three, cry.

277
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:35,311
One, two, three, cry.

278
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,346
How is that water?
Wet like your tears?

279
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:43,018
Precious, is that you?

280
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:44,253
Yes, Mama.

281
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:45,421
You think you're so pretty.

282
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:47,123
Where's my lotto ticket?

283
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,340
I forgot, Mama.

284
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,229
And don't you come back
without it!

285
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:55,231
You hear me?!

286
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:56,982
Hurry up!

287
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,326
I don't see
many more movie roles

288
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:09,044
for a girl like you.

289
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:12,030
Not unless George Lucas
needs another Death Star.

290
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:16,335
No! Stop!
No <i>Star Wars</i> parodies!

291
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:17,470
Homer! Homer!

292
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:19,138
Oh! What?!

293
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:23,692
The school called and said
Bart is out of control.

294
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,162
I think we may need some therapy
for him.

295
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,563
Oh, that's ridiculous.

296
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:31,066
How could two people from
the same family need therapy?

297
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:32,935
Hmm.

298
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:40,910
Dr. Zander?

299
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:42,411
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

300
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:43,696
Anyone?

301
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:45,014
Hmm.

302
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:49,218
Hmm. Hmm.

303
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:55,226
Dr. Zander,
what happened?

304
00:15:55,227 --> 00:15:56,560
Oh, it's the damn economy.

305
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:58,362
When it went south,
the first thing

306
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,765
people stopped spending money on
was expensive therapists.

307
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:02,633
So, we all live here now,

308
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:05,469
along with the other
unemployed luxury professionals:

309
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:07,555
wedding planners,
personal shoppers,

310
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,740
aromatherapists,

311
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:11,342
high-end caterers.

312
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,677
Mushroom cap?

313
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:14,378
Those are pieces
of broken glass.

314
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:16,347
Well, I'll pass that on
to the chef.

315
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:19,183
I'll also pass on pieces
of your face to my monkeys.

316
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:20,885
Look, now my son
needs your help.

317
00:16:20,953 --> 00:16:22,253
How much you got on you?

318
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:24,355
Uh... $23.

319
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:26,891
And there's a can
of beans in my car.

320
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,125
Ugh!

321
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:31,028
After a PhD,
lectures on cruises,

322
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:33,981
monthly column
in <i>Springfield Magazine...</i>

323
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:36,817
Are there franks in the beans?

324
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:43,958
So whatever you did to my
husband, it was too effective.

325
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:47,428
Mm, mm, yes. One of the most
common complaints about therapy.

326
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:50,214
And now my son is a bully.
Can you fix him?

327
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:53,301
Probably, but we should
discuss it in your car.

328
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:55,186
The sommeliers are coming.

329
00:16:55,253 --> 00:16:57,138
Buttery finish.

330
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,773
Great year for Zin.

331
00:16:58,857 --> 00:17:01,325
This is what <i>I</i> drink at home.

332
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,149
Homer, Bart, this
weekend in the wilderness

333
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,951
should repair the shattered
bond between the two of you.

334
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:15,924
I find
that in a natural setting...

335
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,530
Very funny, Bart.

336
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:24,433
That's not the snake, is it?

337
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,301
Sorry, little friend.

338
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,136
Slither back to
your natural element.

339
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:33,558
Now, Bart, I want you

340
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,594
to guide your father
safely through these cacti.

341
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,728
Then what do we win?

342
00:17:36,796 --> 00:17:38,563
A better relationship.

343
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,065
Oh!

344
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,033
Okay, go straight.

345
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:44,085
Three steps right.

346
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:45,587
Two to the left.

347
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:47,272
Now Bart, you do understand

348
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,040
you're supposed
to <i>avoid</i> the cacti.

349
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:50,742
Sure do. I'm just
bad at counting.

350
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,211
Two to the right.

351
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,462
Backwards one.
Oh!

352
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:56,381
Diagonal two.

353
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,266
Now do-se-do.

354
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:02,571
While your father and brother

355
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:05,340
are doing some manly
bonding in the woods,

356
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:08,310
I thought we could do
a little bonding of our own.

357
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:12,180
We'll do each other's nails,
make some brownie sundaes

358
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:15,801
and watch the four saddest
horse movies I could find.

359
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,669
<i>Broken-Leg Beauty,</i>

360
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:20,822
<i>Sorry, Silver,</i>
<i>No More Mint Juleps.</i>

361
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,060
And the fourth one has a title
so sad I can't even say it.

362
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:27,162
Really? Can I see it?

363
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:35,053
Oh, Beauty,

364
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,422
I don't need money or parents

365
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,391
<i>or</i> eyesight when I've got you.

366
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:46,047
Oh, I always forget
about this part.

367
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:52,971
Oh. I don't know.

368
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,141
There's something about this
noose I just don't like.

369
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,310
Homer, desperate times call
for desperate measures.

370
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:00,545
If you hop down from that limb,

371
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:03,215
I assure you,
Bart <i>will</i> cut you down.

372
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:05,283
I don't know.

373
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,552
Keep your neck inside
the rope at all times!

374
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:13,558
Well? Anything?!

375
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:15,360
Can't look. Texting.

376
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:17,812
Ooh, a text.

377
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,715
Let's see. Text message
for I.M.A. Wiener.

378
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:23,385
As you all can see,
I.M.A. Wiener.

379
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,755
I see it, Moe.

380
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:28,957
Why you! When I...

381
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:34,179
When... I... get ahold...
of you, I...

382
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:37,098
Oh, damn it,
I typed an "F" and not a "D."

383
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,200
Uh... Delete. Delete.
Delete. Delete.

384
00:19:39,268 --> 00:19:41,937
Oh, crap,
I just donated $20 to Haiti!

385
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:47,676
Bart, I'm trying to get you

386
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:48,793
to feel something
for your father!

387
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,145
I feel something for him.

388
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:52,413
Here it comes.

389
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:53,698
Why you little...?!

390
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:56,635
Oh, this is a tough neck!

391
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:58,303
Oh, it's so strong!

392
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:00,255
Like an oak.

393
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,357
You see? You see how that
boy pushes your buttons?

394
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:03,808
We'll talk when he's dead!

395
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:07,262
Just break already!

396
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,188
Thanks, Dad.

397
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:19,457
Son, you and I are gonna be
closer than ever

398
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:23,378
as we spend the rest of
our lives suing that therapist.

399
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:24,512
Sue me for what?

400
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,281
My home in a hollowed-out tree?

401
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,684
Pretty sweet, eh, boy?

402
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:32,787
You know, I was skeptical,
but I guess therapy works.
