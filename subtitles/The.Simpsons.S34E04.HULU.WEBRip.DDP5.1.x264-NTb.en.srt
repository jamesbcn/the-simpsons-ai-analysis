Maybe...

babies wearing hats?

93
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:02,248
And it's a whole
baby hat fashion show?

94
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:03,951
- Exactly. Exactly.
- Oh, yeah, there you go.
- Ooh.

00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:13,073
What if you brought out
Instagram dogs

99
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:15,242
and had them do a taste test?

100
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:17,253
Wow!
Well, that's really good.

00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:18,877
What other ideas do you have?

00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,385
You're a natural.
You've got nice ideas

110
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,089
coming out the wazoo.

111
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:43,133
You know, I'm in the market
for a new segment producer.

112
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,473
You are?

113
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:45,938
Will you excuse me for a second?

114
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:47,368
Jerry, you're fired.

116
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,189
Segment producer?

117
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:54,616
I don't know.
I-I should probably

118
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:57,663
talk it over with my family.
(gasps)

119
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,611
I'll take the job.

120
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,180
Be warned, segment producer.

121
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,951
No one makes it out of these
shows unchanged.

122
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:13,463
Oh, well, then it's a good thing
I'm not much of a changer.

123
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:16,199
You can keep your job
or you can keep your soul,

124
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,429
but you can't keep both.

125
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:19,914
Also, when you
turn in your receipts,

126
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:22,776
break them down
between dining and mileage

127
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,589
or you'll await
the reimbursements...

128
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:26,815
forever!

129
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:35,974
So this is behind the scenes
of a TV show.

130
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:38,112
So much hustle.

131
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:39,749
And bustle.

132
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,716
Mm... mm.

133
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,085
This is your desk.

134
00:05:47,094 --> 00:05:50,544
And this is where you can pin
all your genius segment ideas.

135
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:52,535
With five shows a week,
it's very important

136
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:55,009
that you always
be thinking up segments.

137
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,210
A daytime talk show without

138
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:59,022
fun and interesting segments
is like a...

139
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:01,018
You, finish my metaphor.

140
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:02,392
Uh, um...

141
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,731
Get me a baked potato

142
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,269
so I can throw it at your head.

143
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,367
- Now!
-(exclaims, whimpers)

144
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:12,551
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

145
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,646
(humming a tune)

146
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,591
Oh, I-I don't need
to order lunch.

147
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:21,099
My kids packed mine as a
special treat for my first day.

148
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:22,965
Aw.

149
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,080
Hmm. Maybe I will
take a look at that menu.

150
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:31,646
Can I order you something, um...
What-what's your name?

151
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,020
Uh, to make it simpler
for the producers,

152
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:35,591
we're-we're all named Jordan.

153
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,543
I should've ordered some salad

154
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:45,036
to go with my salad toppings.
(chuckles)

155
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,779
Mm.

156
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,696
Oh.

157
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:57,428
(laughing)

158
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:58,844
What the hell is this?

159
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:00,877
You people
didn't write me any jokes.

160
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,445
You don't need jokes.
The women in our audience

161
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:05,476
are just happy
to be out of the house.

162
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:08,263
They want to dance to
clean versions of Pitbull songs

163
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:11,796
and go home with a free copy
of a Real Housewives memoir.

164
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:14,097
Your only job is just be nice.

165
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,071
It's all about nice.

166
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:19,012
Did you just make eye contact
with the host?

167
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,381
No, I would never!

168
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,420

(groans)
Look at this.

186
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,972
I already got
a wardrobe malfunction.

187
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:07,811
(audience laughs)

188
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,809
That's the kind of joke we get.

189
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,988
- Ah.
-♪

190
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:18,698
Oh, my God,
this is my first segment.

191
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:21,567
I hope people like it, Jordan.

192
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,640
Look at this guy.
He's saying,

193
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,550
"I'm gonna wrangle me up a nap."

194
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:28,646
(laughing, whooping)

195
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,450
These are my people.

196
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:33,293
And they're raising the roof
for my idea.

197
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:36,402
Can you believe
we get paid for this?

198
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,139
We don't.

199
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:40,006
<i>(audience cheering, whooping)</i>

200
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:42,946
Bart, you're taking this
really well.

201
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:45,175
I'd have thought
you'd be hatching some scheme

202
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:47,053
to get the old Krusty show back.

203
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:48,124
Why would I do that?

204
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:50,692
I've got my favorite Krusty
episodes right here.

205
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:52,934
More than 700 of 'em.

206
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,268
Hm, kind of makes you think.

207
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:58,812
Once you have enough episodes
of any classic show,

208
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:01,021
why do you need
to keep making more?

209
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:02,815
Well, the reason is...

210
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:04,519
Shh.
Watching classic Krusty.

211
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:06,762
(Krusty the Clown
<i>theme song playing</i>)

212
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,474
Oh, it's just so easy.

213
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,297
I don't
have to be funny anymore.

214
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:13,574
I just have to be nice.

215
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:16,054
It's the greatest grift
I've ever done.

216
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:19,785
(laughs)
I'm gonna go buy some cars.

217
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,386
- Mm...
- You did a great job
today, Marge.

218
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,700
You know, we women have to
stick together in this business.

219
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,738
But I also want you
to never quite be sure

220
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,235
where you stand with me,
and just have

221
00:09:29,238 --> 00:09:32,608
a general sense of unease
about my intentions.

222
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:34,252
Does that make sense?

223
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,948
I think so.

224
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:36,951
Great.

225
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:38,593
Okay, everybody,
conference room.

226
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,290
Pitch meeting for tomorrow.

227
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:41,533
You, plaid shirt.

228
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,600
Not you.
Plaid shirt, tall. Yeah.

229
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040

00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:21,784
You would not believe
the day I had.

246
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:24,576
Oh, please, let's eat.
I'm starving.

247
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,622
Oh, but if the bill looks high,
it's because

248
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,190
I already ate a full meal here.

249
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,404
And then Krusty
didn't even tell us

250
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:34,367
he had swapped
the A and B blocks.

251
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,768
I'd already preset
the demo table

252
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:38,711
for my segment,
"popcorn maker wars."

253
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,280
So, then it's my fault

254
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,520
the "reuniting soldiers
and their dogs" segment

255
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,248
was such a disaster?

256
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:47,364
Carla's the one who
turned on the popcorn machines.

257
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,700
And that's
Hair Department Carla?

258
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,639
No, Hair Department Carla
is blonde.

259
00:10:52,638 --> 00:10:54,468
You know, my day
was pretty crazy, too.

260
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:57,884
Lenny came in this morning
with a ladybug on his shirt,

261
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:00,962
and we were seeing how long
before he noticed it.

262
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:03,655
Segment idea:
"Krusty goes blond."

263
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,030
(laughs)

264
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,329
Lenny made it
all the way to lunch

265
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,014
and then the little guy
just fell off on its own.

266
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:11,606
(laughs)

267
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,580
We called him Ladybug Lenny

268
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,420
for the rest of the day!

269
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,816
(laughs)

270
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,530
- Ah, ladybugs.
-(phone dings)

271
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:21,696
Oh, I have to go back
to the office.

272
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:23,896
The viral skateboard grandma
we booked for tomorrow

273
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:26,771
has a history of racist tweets.

274
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:31,252
Uh, Marge, I forgot my wallet.

275
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:35,624
Hmm.

276
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:39,634
No. Too edgy.
Too soft.

277
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,972
What is this, Corden?

278
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:41,868
Seen it.

279
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,170
Not timely.
Too timely.

280
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:45,644
Way too soft.

281
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:47,354
What is this, Fallon?

282
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:49,347
"Good luck Mom, we love you."

283
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:50,651
I don't even get this.

284
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:52,994
Is that all you got?

285
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,701
Mm...

286
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,313
(sighs) Guys, I know I've been
a little stressed lately,

287
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:04,076
but it's so nice for us
to all sit down together.

288
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:07,351
It's okay, Mom.
You're doing your dream job.

289
00:12:07,354 --> 00:12:09,064
Yeah, we're proud of you, Mom.

290
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:10,657
Now pass the index cards.

291
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:11,531
The what?

292
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,599
I'm hungry for segments.

293
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
Aah!

294
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:17,413
What's the matter,
Marge?

295
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:18,977
You haven't even touched

296
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:21,777
your steamed pushpins.

297
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:25,017
Aah!

298
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:27,461
(gasps)

299
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:30,027
(panting)

300
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:33,867
(exclaims, gasps)

301
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,590
(all grunting)

302
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,417
Aah! Oh!

303
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:44,964
Eh? (sighs)

304
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:49,272
(cackling)

305
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:51,783
Aah!

306
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:54,378
-(sobbing)
-(whimpering)

307
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:56,691
(growling)

308
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:59,256
Mm. Mm...

309
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:00,927
Look alive, people.
The big boss

310
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:02,928
wants to see everyone
for a meeting.

311
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:06,212
Krusty's here? But we don't tape
for another eight minutes.

312
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,805
I just wanted to tell you
how grateful I am

313
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,250
for all your hard work.

314
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,246
I never knew
doing a television show

315
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,260
could require so little effort
on my part.

316
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:18,826
If anyone needs anything,
I'll be in my spray tan tent.

317
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,370
Thanks, Krusty.
You earned it.

318
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,238
Back to work. We need
50 branded segment ideas

319
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:27,681
for Menopause Chapstick and
something called Cereal Wine.

320
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,482
(all groan)

321
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:32,264
At this solemn and holy moment,

322
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:33,657
I baptize thee...

323
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,570
(phone clicking, chiming)

324
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,996
(grumbling)

325
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:41,514
How are we supposed
to do surprise makeovers

326
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:42,879
on the mailmen you brought in?

327
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:44,878
Every one of them
is already gorgeous.

328
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:46,822
ALL:
Shh!

329
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,530
Special thanks to
the Pre-K Pop and Lock Crew.

330
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,927
(cheering, applause)

331
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,572
- That was great.
- It was fine.

332
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:56,871
I mean, look me in the eye

333
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:59,813
and tell me where the GIF was.
Tell me.

334
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:02,692
Uh, uh, uh, when
the little kid breakdanced.

335
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,185
Um, excuse me, Marge,

336
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:06,957
there seems to be an emergency
at your house.

337
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,030
What is so important
that you pulled me out of work?

338
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,073
Marge, there's no emergency.

339
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,540
Have a seat.
This is an intervention.

340
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,452
-(gasps)
-(toilet flushes)

341
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:19,545
I missed the big reveal?
You said I had time.

342
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:21,292
Midge, go out and come back in.

343
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:23,888
Aw, nah, forget that.
Who's that even for?

344
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:26,674
All right, all right,
intervention. And, uh, go.

345
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,836
If this is about
the melatonin gummies,

346
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:30,937
I can stop whenever I want.

347
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:32,551
No, Marge.
We're interventioning

348
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:34,305
you and your whole deal.

349
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:36,254
I never thought
I'd speak ill of TV,

350
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,791
but I think it's destroying you.

351
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,030
(grumbles)

352
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,756
PATTY and SELMA:
Mm-hmm.

353
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:44,273
Cut to commercial.

354
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:50,175
Okay, let's make this quick.
Everybody say your little thing.

355
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,219
We're just
worried about you, Marge.

356
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:55,257
Look, even your best friend
Luann is here.

357
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:56,826
Best friend?

358
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,826
We haven't
had the conversation yet,

359
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,830
but it's unspoken.

360
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,914
Mom, we want to be supportive
of your dreams,

361
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:05,875
but you just don't
seem to be enjoying it anymore.

362
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:08,278
Oh, I'm sorry.

363
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,622
Sorry that
you're all so threatened

364
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:12,691
by a powerful, successful woman.

365
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:16,231
Lisa, as a feminist, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

366
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:18,871
Really?
Just this week the show's done

367
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,310
"sext your way
out of traffic school"

368
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:25,118
and debuted a new daily segment
called "trends in cleavage."

369
00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:28,556
- When's this show on again?
-(phone dings)

370
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:29,627
MARGE: Mm?

371
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:35,136
The Internet's on fire
about our story

372
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:38,106
exposing the toxic
work environment at <i>Krusty.</i>

373
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:40,879
- Inexcusable.
- I heard they made
all the interns

374
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,991
convert to Judaism
and work on Christmas,

375
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,215
then convert back
and work on Passover.

376
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,163
-(all gasp)
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,230
(gasps)
This is a disaster.

378
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:52,171
We can finish
this dumb thing later.

379
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,410
Hmm. So, um,
what's the move here?

380
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,619
Well, is there anything else
we can work on?

381
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:58,775
Hey Homer, how's the drinking?

382
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:00,223
Same.

383
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:02,459
-(indistinct chatter)
-(whimpering)

384
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:09,342
What the hell is this?

385
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:12,277
For the first time in my life,
I'm not responsible

386
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:15,847
for a toxic work environment.
I'm barely ever here.

387
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,061
Physically,
and certainly not mentally.

388
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:19,215
Don't worry, Krusty.

389
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:21,934
I'm going to find whoever said
it's terrible to work here

390
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,300
and personally bully them until
their hair falls out in clumps.

391
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:28,313
But what you need now
is a redemption episode.

392
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:31,149
And I know I speak
for the entire staff when I say

393
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:33,988
we're willing to pull an
all-nighter to make it happen.

394
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:36,357
(sobbing)

395
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:37,998
Aah!

396
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:40,395
Yeah, and you'll write me
one of those apologies

397
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,299
where it sounds like I'm sorry
but I'm not actually

398
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:44,343
taking the blame for anything?

399
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,711
I've done hundreds of these.
It's actually a template

400
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:48,423
in the software we use.

401
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,359
Uh, what else?

402
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,825
Bart, you got to be addicted
to something by now.

403
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:55,397
None of your business.

404
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:57,026
Fair enough.

405
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,003
(distorted):
♪ Shawty had them ♪

406
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:02,114
-♪ Apple Bottom jeans ♪
-♪ Jeans ♪

407
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,780

408

♪ With the fur. ♪

409
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:09,186
I was devastated
to learn that our show

410
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,260
has become
a toxic work environment.

411
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,773
Well, even though
I knew absolutely nothing

412
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:18,409
about what was going on,
the buck stops with me.

413
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,019
And I promise you, I'm going
to take some time to listen,

414
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:26,056
learn, not touch, and listen.

415
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,128
What the hell is this?!

416
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,072
How am I supposed
to do the salad shake

417
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,640
if it's not
in its original container?

418
00:17:34,642 --> 00:17:36,112
-(grunts)
- Aah!

419
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:38,451
(whimpering)

420
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:40,289
Oh, my God.

421
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:42,456
What have I become?

422
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:51,439
I was completely unaware
of the following policies:

423
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,151
if employees see me in my car,

424
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,175
they must lower
imaginary sunglasses

425
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:57,352
as if impressed and aroused.

426
00:17:57,353 --> 00:17:59,463
Krusty, you don't
need to do this.

427
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:01,527
- The world
needs to know the truth.
-(phone rings)

428
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:04,399
It's the system of daytime TV
that's toxic.

429
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:06,371
It's turned us all into monsters

430
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:08,241
fueled by stress, gaslighting,

431
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:10,682
and $15 kale Caesar salads.

432
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:13,291
The pressure to crank out
so much nice

433
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:15,485
brings out the worst in us.

434
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,759
We just wanted to bring
more nice in the world.

435
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,903
More nice.

436
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,711
Okay, new speech.

437
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:24,165
This non-apology apology

438
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,714
just became a real apology.

439
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:27,953
This place isn't toxic

440
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:30,488
because of whoever this lady is

441
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,556
or "the system."

442
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,028
- It's toxic because of me.
-(audience gasps)

443
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:37,099
I'm a showbiz monster.

444
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,970
I'm not nice.

445
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,010
So I'm stepping away
from the show...

446
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:42,748
forever.

447
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:44,045
-(gasps)
- Wha?

448
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:46,947
Krusty. Krusty,
you don't have to do this.

449
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:48,493
It's not your fault.

450
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,629
Look, lady, I couldn't
agree with you more.

451
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:53,427
Everyone who works here
except me is nuts.

452
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,442
I just quit because I closed
the deal for a new gig

453
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:58,508
which makes
daytime talk show money

454
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,850
look like late night
talk show money.

455
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:03,147
TV judge syndication money.

456
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,192
A judge?

457
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:07,927
Judge Judy is the richest
TV star in the world.

458
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:10,128
So I'm gonna be Judge Krusty.

459
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:13,072
I can let my body go,
just sit on my keister

460
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:15,412
and speak truth
to stupid all day.

461
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,979
All right, I got to go
work on my humiliation quips.

462
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,823
You ever do any bailiffing?

463
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:21,861
Some.

464
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,586
No more show?

465
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:27,626
I'm... I'm free.

466
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:31,037
Oh come on,
why would you do that?

467
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,411
Sorry, Pat, sorry, sorry.

468
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:35,917
<i>KRUSTY:
Oh, come on.</i>

469
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,117
Don't sneeze on my robe

470
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,220
and tell me I'm in a car wash.

471
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:41,234
Did you fall out
of the stupid tree

472
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:43,098
and land in the idiot mulch?

473
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,968
His quips could use some work.

474
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:46,569
(laughs)
Mulch.

475
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:48,842
Do you ever miss
working in TV, Mom?

476
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:52,183
There was at least a week there
where you seemed to enjoy it.

477
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,663
Sure, it was
rewarding at first.

478
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:56,855
But this experience
has made me realize

479
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:00,999
my real dream job
is producing this family.

480
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,501
And now, as a consultant,

481
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:04,984
I get the best of both worlds.

482
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:06,475
(phone rings)

483
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:08,448
Marge, it's Drew.
I need your help.

484
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:10,949
I got no A block for tomorrow.

485

488
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:20,506
Yes, I'm thinking
surprise spa day for him.

489
00:20:20,507 --> 00:20:22,947
And an extreme pond makeover
for the ducks.

490
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:26,345
Oh, Marge, are you sure
you won't come work for me?

491
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,061
That's very sweet, Drew,

492
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:30,485
but my daytime days are over.

493
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,403

00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:37,711
