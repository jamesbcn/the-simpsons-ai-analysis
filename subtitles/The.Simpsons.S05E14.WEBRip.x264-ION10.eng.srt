dropping coins on people.

J.D. Rockefeller flyin' by,

00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,944

I just used it that morning
to wash my turkey,

00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,042

00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,586
a "walking bird."

56
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,130

Then we'd all watch football,

61
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,483
which in those days
was called "baseball."

Don't you have anything

<i>I'm just a girl! (giggles)</i>

-Right on! Say it, sister.
-It's not funny, Bart.

145
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,991
Millions of girls will grow up thinking
that this is the right way to act.

146
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,334
That they can never be anything
more than vacuous ninnies

whose only goal is to look
pretty, land a rich husband,

148

equally vacuous friends...

150
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,503

terrific it is

151
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,593

152
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,208

00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,885
Lisa, ordinarily I'd say

169
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,813
you should stand up
for what you believe in.

170
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,142
But you've been doing that
an awful lot lately.

171
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,858
Yeah. You made us march
in that gay rights parade.

172
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,860
And we can't watch Fox,
'cause they own

173
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,152
those chemical
weapon plants in Syria.

174
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,146
I can't believe you're just
gonna stand by

175
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,318
as your daughters grow up
in a world where this--

176
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,276
this is their role model.

177
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,247
I had a Malibu Stacy when I was little,
and I turned out all right.

178
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:03,079
Now, let's forget our troubles with
a big bowl of strawberry ice cream.

179
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,957
<i>Now let's forget our troubles with</i>
<i>a big bowl of strawberry ice cream!</i>

180
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,547
(groans)

181
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,632
That's it!
I'm callin' the company.

182
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,888
MALE VOICE: <i>Hello, you have</i>
<i>reached the Malibu Stacy</i>

183
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,142
<i>customer service center.</i>

184
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,983
<i>If you have a</i>
<i>complaint about</i>

185
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,518
<i>Malibu Stacy's appearance</i>
<i>or odor, press one.</i>

186
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,602
<i>If you've given</i>
<i>Malibu Stacy a haircut</i>

187
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,358
<i>and need to order</i>
<i>a replacement head, press two.</i>

188
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,740
<i>For information on our</i>
<i>factory tour, press three.</i>

189
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,359
Mom! We could go on
the factory tour,

190
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,655
and I could
complain in person.

191
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,869
Honey, you're not going to throw
red paint at the executives, are you?

192
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,332
The Keebler people
were very upset.

193
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,003
{\an8}Welcome to
Enchantment Lane,

194
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,206
{\an8}where all the
parts come together,

195
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,917
{\an8}and Malibu Stacy is born!

196
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,337
Some folks say
there's a little touch

197
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,336
of fairy dust in the air.

198
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,308
(grumbling)

199
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:05,313
Aw, crap. There's a clog
in the torso chute!

200
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,516
Leroy!
Get your ass in gear.

201
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,727
Shut your hole.

202
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,106
(grunting)

203
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,780
ANNOUNCER: <i>Malibu Stacy,</i>
<i>America's favorite</i>

204
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,074
<i>eight-and-a-half-incher.</i>

205
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:21,828
<i>In 1959, homemaker Stacy Lavelle</i>
<i>had a design and a dream.</i>

206
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,872
<i>The design? Malibu Stacy.</i>

207
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,706
<i>The dream?</i>

208
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,381
<i>To mass-market a fashion doll</i>
<i>that was also edible.</i>

209
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,341
<i>Kids didn't much like</i>
<i>the taste of dried onion meal,</i>

210
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,672
<i>but they loved the doll.</i>

211
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,758
<i>A second, plastic Malibu Stacy</i>
<i>took America by storm.</i>

212
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,604
<i>Just ask the owner of the world's</i>
<i>largest Malibu Stacy collection:</i>

213
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,601
<i>Waylon Smithers</i>
<i>of Springfield.</i>

214
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:47,193
<i>Hello, Malibu Stacy collectors.</i>
<i>I'll see you</i>

215
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,691
<i>At Stacycon '94, at</i>
<i>the San Diego Airport Hilton.</i>

216
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,395
ANNOUNCER: <i>And what does Stacy</i>
<i>think of her 35 years of success...</i>

217
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,447
<i>And millions of friends</i>
<i>worldwide?</i>

218
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,410
<i>Don't ask me.</i>
<i>I'm just a girl! (giggles)</i>

219
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,503
ANNOUNCER:
<i>(chuckles) She sure is.</i>

220
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,619
Well, that's the tour.

221
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,706
If you have any questions,
I'd be happy to answer--

222
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,502
-I have one.
-Yes?

223
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,705
Is the remarkably sexist drivel
spouted by Malibu Stacy

224
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,507
intentional, or is it
just a horrible mistake?

225
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,681
(chuckles) Believe me, we're very
mindful of such concerns.

226
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,682
(wolf whistle)

227
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,894
Hey, Jiggles! Grab a pad
and back that gorgeous butt in here.

228
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,435
Oh, you. Get away!
(chuckles)

229
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,769
Ah, don't act like
you don't like it.

230
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,898
(Lisa moans)

231
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,606
It's awful bein' a kid.
No one listens to ya.

232
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,866
It's rotten bein' old.
No one listens to ya!

233
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,409
I'm a white male,
aged 18 to 49.

234
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,913
Everyone listens to me,

235
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,374
no matter how dumb
my suggestions are.

236
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,996
(chewing noisily)

237
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,464
But I'm not gonna accomplish
anything just sitting here--

238
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,705
-And gripin', it's time for--
-Action!

239
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,627
I've got to talk to that woman
who invented Malibu Stacy

240
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,887
-and see if I can get her to--
-Come out of retirement!

241
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,849
I'm gonna get me a job!
A real Malibu...

242
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,061
And see if Stacy can help

243
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,193
invent me young.

244
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,571
Help!

245
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,938
-You're getting a job!
-Yes! I'm going where the action is!

246
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,857
-(radio static)
-Come in? Come in!

247
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,406
Mayday! I'm losing
your transmission!

248
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,830
-I said, "French fries!"
-(horns honking)

249
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,699
-What the--
-(horns honking)

250
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:30,036
Do we sell French fries?

251
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,670
Yes? I-- (chuckles)

252
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,054
Why, it's Homer Simpson's
daughter.

253
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,801
I thought you might be able to help me

254
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,973
get in touch with the inventor
of Malibu Stacy.

255
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,721
Whew! (chuckles)
That would be quite a feat.

256
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,684
Stacy Lavelle is
a total recluse.

257
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,015
She hasn't appeared
in public in 20 years.

258
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,650
Here, I'm writing an article on her
for my next Malibu Stacy newsletter.

259
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,689
It contains her last
known whereabouts.

260
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,534
-I'll, uh, print you out a copy.
-Thanks.

261
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,899
<i>Hello, Smithers.</i>

262
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,526
<i>You're quite good...</i>
<i>at turning... me on.</i>

263
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,235
Um, you probably
should ignore that.

264
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,866
(panting)

265
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,285
(tires skidding)

266
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,666
No, it couldn't be!

267
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,349
-(buzzing)
-Excuse me. Miss Lavelle?

268
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,732
I'd like to talk to you
about Malibu Stacy?

269
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,730
<i>Do you have any idea how many kids</i>
<i>have tried to track me down?</i>

270
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,685
-Am I the first?
<i>-Yes.</i>

271
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:43,566
I want you to hear what Malibu Stacy
is telling a generation of little girls.

272
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,736
<i>Thinking too much</i>
<i>gives you wrinkles.</i>

273
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,579
(gate rattles)

274
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:55,835
All right! I've been waitin'
nine years to get my frisbee back.

275
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,168
Oh!

276
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,760
<i>My name is Stacy.</i>
<i>But you can call me--</i>

277
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,643
<i>(wolf whistle)</i>

278
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,639
I see exactly what you mean.
This is a problem.

279
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,522
But what do you
expect me to do?

280
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,809
Change what she says.
It's your company.

281
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,943
(scoffs) Not since
I was forced out in 1974.

282
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,361
They said my way of thinking
just wasn't cost-effective.

283
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,611
-That's awful!
-Well, that, and...

284
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,824
I was funneling profits
to the Vietcong.

285
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,695
But you are Malibu Stacy.

286
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,792
And as long as she has your name,
you have a responsibility!

287
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,949
I'd be mortified if someone
ever made a lousy product

288
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,867
with the Simpson name on it.

289
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,456
I may have had things in common
with Stacy in the beginning,

290
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,883
but 30 years of living her lifestyle
taught me some very harsh lessons.

291
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,634
Five husbands:
Ken, Johnny, Joe,

292
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,098
Dr. Colossus, Steve Austin.

293
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,848
But if you can learn from Malibu Stacy's
mistakes, so can everyone.

294
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,642
I'm sure we can
think of something together.

295
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,516
-Come on!
-Not now. I'm too drunk.

296
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,185
No, you're not!

297
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,066
(slurping, swallowing)

298
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,612
Uh, I'll come back tomorrow.

299
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:11,827
We need some more secret sauce!
Put this mayonnaise in the sun.

300
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,421
Hey! Now that old man Peterson's
off our backs, let's have some fun!

301
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:21,668
(muffled) Ever see a sandwich
that could take a bite outta you?

302
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,554
(laughing)
Look at the sandwich!

303
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,382
It's gonna bite you!

304
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,845
-(biting sound)
-MAN: Ow!

305
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,470
Damn sandwich
took a bite out of me!

306
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,556
Oh.

307
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,136
I've got the solution.

308
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,227
You and I are gonna make
our own talking doll.

309
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,984
She'll have the wisdom
of Gertrude Stein

310
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,776
and the wit
of Cathy Guisewite.

311
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,609
The tenacity of Nina Totenberg

312
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,494
and the common sense
of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

313
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:53,492
And to top it off, the down-to-earth good
looks of Eleanor Roosevelt.

314
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,827
(exhales)

315
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,082
All right.

316
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,043
We'll make your doll!

317
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,673
-(pounding on door)
-(gasps)

318
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,052
Stacy, please.
I must have you back.

319
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,969
Just come for a ride with me
in my mobile command unit.

320
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,759
Joe, I told you.
It's over.

321
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,353
Release me from
your kung fu grip.

322
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,928
Fine.

323
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,893
I'll bomb your house
into the ground, missy!

324
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,654
Make sure you get
my mom's hair just right!

325
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,192
Um, I think we'll use someone
different for the hair.

326
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,486
How about me?

327
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,949
There's something
not quite--

328
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,779
-How 'bout me?
-(stammering)

329
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,784
-How 'bout me?
-You all have hideous hair!

330
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,946
(Simpsons gasping)

331
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,084
I mean, from a design
point of view.

332
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,791
-Oh, well, if you put it that way.
-Oh, well.

333
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,172
Talking doll, take eight.

334
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,750
"When I get married,
I'm keeping my own name."

335
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,797
Uh, you know,
that should probably be,

336
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,090
"if I choose to get married."

337
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,224
Look, little girl, we got other
talking dollies to record today.

338
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,933
All right, you poindexters.
Let's get this right.

339
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,055
One: "Hey, hey, kids,
I'm talkin' Krusty."

340
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,142
Two: "Hey, hey! Here
comes Sideshow Mel."

341
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,397
Again. "Here comes Sideshow Mel.
Sideshow Mel."

342
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,399
Three.
(laughing)

343
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,361
Bada-bing, bada-boom. I'm done.
Learn from a professional, kid.

344
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,324
(car door closing,
tires screeching)

345
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,115
Okay, Krusty. We are ready
to roll any-- What the--

346
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,460
LISA'S VOICE: <i>Trust in yourself</i>
<i>and you can achieve anything.</i>

347
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,462
All right!
Now all we need is a name.

348
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,554
How 'bout "Blabbermouth,
the Jerky Doll for Jerks"?

349
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,089
How 'bout Minerva, after
the Roman goddess of wisdom?

350
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,215
Mm, not enough
commercial appeal.

351
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,142
"Wendy Windbag"?
"Ugly Doris"?

352
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,141
"Hortense, the mule-faced doll"?

353
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,353
I think we should
name her after Lisa.

354
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,274
We'll call her
"Lisa Lionheart."

355
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:47,023
No, "Loudmouth Lisa!"
"Stupid Lisa Garbage Face!"

356
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,487
I can't stand this any longer.
Somebody please pay attention to me!

357
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,819
Hello! Pay attention to me.
Look at me!

358
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,025
I'm Bart, I'm Bart. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me. (blathering)

359
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,410
This is great! They're
really gonna sell our doll!

360
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,577
Well, it wasn't difficult. I just told
them who I was and who you were.

361
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,666
-They couldn't resist.
-Really?

362
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,962
Well, I didn't tell them
who you were.

363
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,761
Gentlemen, we've got to sink this
Lisa Lionheart doll and fast.

364
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,013
It's time to call in a favor
from Washington.

365
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,479
Yes. Yes, I understand.
I'll take care of it personally.

366
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,649
(chuckling)

367
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,323
-LISA: Dad, did you hear something?
-HOMER: I don't know.

368
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,532
-Dad?
-Mm-hmm?

369
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,953
My new doll's much better
than Malibu Stacy.

370
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,371
Do a newscast about her.

371
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,239
(laughing)
Oh, please, honey.

372
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,696
Daddy's job is to bring
people important news.

373
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,407
Right now,
I'm very busy preparing

374
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,707
a report about the 40th
anniversary of Beetle Bailey.

375
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,091
Oh, Daddy, that is boring.

376
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,548
Talk about the dolly!

377
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,419
Well, you were right
about the Berlin Wall.

378
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,216
<i>Though it was unusual to spend</i>
<i>28 minutes reporting on a doll,</i>

379
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,176
<i>this reporter found it</i>
<i>impossible to stop talking.</i>

380
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,398

382
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,225
<i>Oh, and the president</i>

383
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,737
<i>More on that tomorrow night.</i>

384
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,489
<i>Or you can turn</i>

385
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,242
<i>Oh. Do not turn</i>
<i>to another channel.</i>

386
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,704
Our one effort to put a stop to this
Lisa Lionheart thing has failed miserably.

387
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,036
Gentlemen, we have to reinvent
Malibu Stacy for the '90s.

388
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,383
We'll stay here all night,
if need be.

389
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,958
Can we order Chinese food?

390
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,174
Yes.

391
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,634
-(chattering)
-You know a good place?

392
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,098
I cut my tongue
on these pancakes.

393
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,599
These eggs are difficult
to digest.

394
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,891
I want soft-boiled eggs.

395
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,845
I told you-- We don't
have soft-boiled eggs!

396
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,397
If you a--

397
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,190
By gum, you're right.
We should have them.

398
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,485
I shouldn't be listenin'
to complaints.

399
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,739
I should be makin' 'em
with you guys.

400
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,071
The good Lord lets us
grow old for a reason.

401
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,328
To gain the wisdom to find
fault with everything He's made!

402
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:10,042
Mr. Peterson, you can take
this job and... fill it.

403
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,295
And one more thing.
I never once washed my hands.

404
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,469
That's your policy,
not mine.

405

She is better than ever.

Wait! Don't be fooled.

420
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,798
She's just a regular Malibu Stacy
with a stupid, cheap hat.

421
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,805
She still embodies all the awful
stereotypes she did before.

422
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,558
But she's got a new hat.

it'll all be worth it.

430
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,043
Yes. Particularly if that
little girl happens to pay

431
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,008
$46,000 for that doll.

432
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,628

-Oh, nothing. Kudos to you, Lisa.
