1
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,061
34, 35...

2
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:28,496
37?

3
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,730
No!

4
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,500
Oh, I have to go
all the way around again.

5
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,009
I had the locker dream again.

6
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,079
Oh, honey,
that's four nights in a row.

7
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:47,181
Stupid recurring dreams.

8
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:49,016
Why can't brains come up
with something new?

9
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,019
That's why they're losing
viewers to Netflix.

10
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,622
Maybe I should talk
to a therapist.

11
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,558
Sweetie, our insurance won't pay
for any more sessions.

12
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,960
Your father used them all up
on grief counseling

13
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,463
after the Halloween candy
ran out.

14
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,065
I've come to accept
that we were lucky to have it

15
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,034
while we did.

16
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,869
But I know a cheap place
where you can see

17
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,272
the therapists of tomorrow
today.

18
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,108
Behold,
Springfield Community College,

19
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:17,411
where the students practice
on you!

20
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:20,781
I only paid a student dentist
$12 for this brand-new crown.

21
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,416
See?

22
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,285
I don't think
it's supposed to come out.

23
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,287
That's why I paid
a student paralegal to sue him.

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,555
I lost!

25
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,568
TV must be a circle!

26
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:46,140
Give him the full flea dip
and deluxe under-worming.

27
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:47,308
I'm not a dog.

28
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,976
And I've been worm-free
for two weeks!

29
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,778
You better muzzle him.
He's a biter.

30
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,683
My name is Annette,
and I'm a therapist-in-training.

31
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,117
I'm also a mother-to-be,

32
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,019
so I know
there's nothing more beautiful

33
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,088
than a child's feelings.

34
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,424
You sound so caring
and professional.

35
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,993
When do I give you
the seven dollars?

36
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,661
There's a shoebox by the door.

37
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:10,631
So what does
my locker dream mean?

38
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,300
Am I stressed about school?

39
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,134
I mean,
schools are full of lockers.

40
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,370
Hey, who's
the almost-therapist here?

41
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,187
You know, I think you
might benefit from art therapy.

42
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,890
Draw in these empty panels

43
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,859
to tell the story
of a typical day

44
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,028
in the life of you,
Sophia Barnum.

45
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,798
Once again,
learn the patient's name.

46
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,033
Sorry, Professor.

47
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,468
Lisa Simpson.

48
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,303
Excellent. Continue.

49
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,905
Your light's still on.

50
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,342
Art therapy.

51
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,978
Okay, draw a typical day.

52
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,151
Horrible!

53
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,754
It looks like it was drawn
by an eight-year-old!

54
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:17,064
Oh, boy, I can't wait
to take you to the park.

55
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,233
The other owners
will be so jealous.

56
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,001
You're not my owner.

57
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,736
I kinda am.

58
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:40,388
I'm hearing
a lot of feelings in here.

59
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,391
You're hearing them
because I am not drawing them!

60
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,126
Sweetie, drawing is tricky.

61
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,129
But you just need to start with
something simple, like people.

62
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,064
Those are people.

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,936
It's easy, honey.

64
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,374
Add some eyelashes here,

65
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:03,043
some crosshatching
to show shadow,

66
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,447
vary the line width here
to accent the outline,

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,916
and voilÃ !

68
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,083
That's great!

69
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,419
Now in the next panel,

70
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,086
I want her to be looking out
a window,

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,988
wondering if she'll ever get out

72
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,591
from under the weight
of her own expectations.

73
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,928
Well, I could make the eyebrows
come down in a V.

74
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,130
That says it all.

75
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,735
Hey, Mom, what if I told you
the things I was feeling

76
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,303
and you drew them?

77
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,971
Okay. But I'm warning you,

78
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,140
I'm not good at drawing
turtle feet.

79
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,075
So if there are any turtles
in this,

80
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,810
they're gonna be wearing
sneakers.

81
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:37,978
Deal.

82
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,914
It starts with the story
of a regular day...

83
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,827
Gosh, I forgot how hard school
can be for a sensitive kid.

84
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,061
It's miserable.

85
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,998
But you captured my feelings
perfectly!

86
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,068
Annette, wait till you see
my art therapy!

87
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,837
You're gonna love it too.

88
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,006
Please try to pretend
I'm not here.

89
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,173
Okay, Stephen.

90
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,977
Hey, where did it go?

91
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,313
Best marriage counseling ever.

92
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,382
But we still need to discuss

93
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,484
your addiction
to unboxing videos.

94
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:54,688
Do not make me choose
between you and unboxing.

95
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,828
Manga!

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,871
It's been a week, and I still
can't find my therapy comic.

97
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,039
I'd be just mortified

98
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:15,075
if even one person saw
my private thoughts...

99
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,013
Mom, can I have
permission to swear?

100
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,249
Okay, as long
as it's a tier one.

101
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,250
Damn it!

102
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,685
That didn't work.

103
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,186
Can I go to tier two?

104
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,055
- I'm afraid not.
- Damn it!

105
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,360
And with that seal cut,

106
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,930
we have completed the unboxing
of the outer shipping plastic.

107
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,966
Indeed we have.

108
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,472
You published my private
art therapy as a comic book?

109
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,239
Actually,
it's a graphic novel.

110
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,875
The distinctions
are threefold...

111
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,042
- Shut up!
- Okay then.

112
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,111
In my defense,
my wife did it.

113
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,747
Kumiko, how could you?

114
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,982
I have acted shamefully.

115
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,651
I must commit furry cosplay.

116
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,657
There's nothing sexy
about shame!

117
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:06,594
Except in my native Japan,
where it's our whole thing.

118
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,797
Mr. and Mrs. Book Guy,
you had no right to do this!

119
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,965
These are
my daughter's feelings.

120
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,501
And my doodles.

121
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:14,935
I shall burn them on a pyre

122
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,937
and disperse them
to the seven winds.

123
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,405
That's all I ask.

124
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,243
One Sad Girl, please.

125
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,645
Sad Girl's the best!

126
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,947
It's tragically delicious!

127
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,016
Wait!

128
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,018
Maybe this isn't so bad.

129
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,454
My Lulus!

130
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,165
Oh, there she is.

131
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,333
Ask for her autograph.

132
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,668
You ask her, man.

133
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,036
I'm freakin' out.

134
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,871
Wow, Lisa, our cartoon book

135
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,640
seems to have really
captured the...

136
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,875
What's that word
I'm looking for?

137
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,544
Zeitgeist!

138
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,145
Oh, hi, Mel!

139
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,813
Say hi to Barbara for me.

140
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:03,483
I'm not your messenger boy!

141
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,620
What's so great
about graphic novels?

142
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,455
They're just comic books
with no superheroes

143
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,058
and no cool sound effects
like Thwam!

144
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,392
Ack-ack-ack-ack!

145
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,995
- And Fwwwip!
- Snag!

146
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,730
Lisa, Kumiko called.

147
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:20,000
She sold all her copies
and wants us to make a sequel!

148
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,571
That's like a prequel
but in the future.

149
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,838
What do you say, sweetie?

150
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,674
Do you have more sad in you?

151
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,076
I've got scads of sad!

152
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,079
<i>Oh, no, not again</i>

153
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,481
<i>There they go</i>

154
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,884
<i>With pad and pen</i>

155
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:40,253
<i>Collaboration</i>

156
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:44,091
<i>Ooh, collaboration</i>

157
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,061
<i>Collaboration</i>

158
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:51,431
<i>Collaboration</i>

159
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,768
Okay, now draw me
overhearing the other girls

160
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,770
talking about how
they're not gonna invite me

161
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:57,938
to a birthday party.

162
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,072
Like this?

163
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,741
Fantastic!

164
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,242
Now let's take a little break.

165
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,111
And you know what that means.

166
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,412
Hot Sharpie!

167
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,414
Hot Sharpie!

168
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,515
- Hot Sharpie!
- Hot Sharpie!

169
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,717
- Hot Sharpie!
- Hot Sharpie!

170
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,186
- You almost got me!
- How come we never bond like that?

171
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,188
I don't know,
you never make the first move.

172
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,423
Okay.

173
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,092
There is something I've
always wanted to do with you.

174
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,266
Hey, those guys stole
our fishing poles!

175
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,101
And my skipping stones!

176
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,790
Welcome to Chicks with Pix,

177
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,760
a panel discussion
with women writers and artists.

178
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,261
I'm your moderator, Roz Chast.

179
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,096
You may know
my New Yorker cartoons

180
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,765
that are both funny ha-ha

181
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,767
and funny aha.

182
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,136
Silence!

183
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,306
Joining me today
are Alison Bechdel,

184
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,141
Marjane Satrapi,

185
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,744
and the creators of Sad Girl,
Lisa Simpson...

186
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,948
We love you, Lisa!

187
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,116
And Marge Simpson.

188
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,754
We're wasting time!

189
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,656
Marjane, as the author
of Persepolis

190
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,758
and someone who grew up
in a repressive regime,

191
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,994
what advice would you offer
to young women?

192
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,996
Always remember
nothing is more valuable

193
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,831
than your own unique voice.

194
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,667
Also, when they promise you
a tote bag for doing a panel,

195
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:36,436
make sure it's not just
a reusable grocery bag.

196
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,438
Look at this.

197
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,107
Alison Bechdel, recently,

198
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,176
a lot of people have been
talking about the Bechdel Test.

199
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,679
Exactly what kind
of drinking game is that?

200
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,848
Actually, it's just
an observation I made

201
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,017
about how movies and TV
rarely show

202
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,452
two women talking about
something other than a man.

203
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,021
That's so interesting.

204
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,189
I'll have to tell my husband
about that.

205
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,395
Bechdel Test, Fail!

206
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,164
<i>Bechdel, Bechdel</i>

207
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,066
<i>Bechdel, fail!</i>

208
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,467
<i>Fail!</i>

209
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,469
<i>Fail...</i>

210
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,238
Okay. We have five minutes

211
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,006
before we have to clear
the room

212
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,008
for the
White Men in Comics panel.

213
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,810
I have a question for Lisa.

214
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,546
I have a question for Lisa
with a follow-up for Lisa.

215
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,749
I want to talk about myself
for a few minutes,

216
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,384
then at the end, pretend it
was all a question for Lisa.

217
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,987
Does anyone have any questions
for my mom?

218
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,056
She does draw every panel.

219
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,191
Yeah, I have a question
for Marge.

220
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,160
How lucky are you
to work with Lisa?

221
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,594
Lisa!

222
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,997
Lisa! Lisa!

223
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,032
Lisa win!

224
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,401
Marge fail.

225
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,673
Honey, I was thinking.

226
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,576
What if we did a chapter
from the mom's point of view?

227
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,212
I took a stab at writing it up.
Give it a read.

228
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,546
In front of you?

229
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,949
Okay.

230
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,890
What are you laughing at?

231
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,524
You left out a word here,

232
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,361
so it just says, I lonely.

233
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,597
So should I start drawing it?

234
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,400
Well, there's a lot
of great stuff here.

235
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,369
Really? Because that's
what I was going for.

236
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,873
But I'm not sure this is
a Sad Girl thing.

237
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,374
Maybe it's a separate book

238
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,543
and I could write the forward.

239
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,045
Oh, I get it.

240
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,647
This isn't a real
collaboration at all.

241
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,716
You agree with those girl
fanboys.

242
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,919
You think it's all about you.

243
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,553
Hey, you can't blame me

244
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,156
if people want to focus on
my contribution.

245
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,158
I can and I do.

246
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,660
I hate to say it, Mom,

247
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,130
but maybe we should
take a break.

248
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,632
Good idea. Hot Sharpie.

249
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,769
No. I mean,
maybe we should take

250
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,139
a real break.

251
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,941
- You mean...?
- That's right.

252
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,944
I want to see other
illustrators.

253
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,779
- I don't even know how you could say that.
- Stupid Lisa.

254
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,114
- It's my vision.
- She's acting like a real B.

255
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,783
Ladies, there's someone here
to see you.

256
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,754
My name is Guthrie Frenel,

257
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,991
visionary theatrical director
and impish genius.

258
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,194
And I want to make Sad Girl
into a smash Broadway show.

259
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,664
I think he came in
through the window.

260
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,500
Oh, tubby, you're a delight.

261
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:24,839
You want to make Sad Girl
into a stage musical?

262
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:28,809
If I may borrow a phrase
from my father, woo-hoo!

263
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,728
This is all very exciting,

264
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:31,895
but before we go any further...

265
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:34,664
and I ask this just
for clarification...

266
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:36,867
- What's your deal, weirdo?
- Dad.

267
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,037
Guthrie Frenel is a visionary
director and an impish genius.

268
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,139
He did a version of
Waiting for Godot.

269
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:45,508
- Where Godot appears in the first scene.
- What?

270
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,746
And that was nothing compared
to my vision for Sad Girl.

271
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,814
I want to do something new
and amazing,

272
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,050
like my all-dog version of Cats.

273
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,818
But I need something from you.

274
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,320
- Anything.
- I need your passion.

275
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:58,756
I need your joy.

276
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:01,825
Are we all together for this
three-person toboggan ride

277
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,927
down Mount Collabor-manjaro?

278
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:08,031
Well, Lisa and I did just have
a little spat.

279
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:11,568
Yeah, but conflict is part of
the creative process, right?

280
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,170
Not in my experience!

281
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:15,238
So are you in?

282
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,908
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

283
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,178
Oh, this is gonna take hours.

284
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:26,283
Bart, there's one thing I know
about Broadway shows,

285
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:28,118
they always make money.

286
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,553
So I'm already looking forward
to quitting my job.

287
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:31,889
Can I quit school?

288
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:34,925
I'd be a pretty lousy dad
if I said no.

289
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,595
It's our duty as artists

290
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,564
to rip up the contract between
audience and performers.

291
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:43,600
Cell phones will be turned on.

292
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,036
Candy will be unwrapped
during the show.

293
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:48,038
We'll hire performance artists

294
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:51,041
to make the line for the
ladies room extra long.

295
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:55,145
How closely
are we gonna stick

296
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:57,480
to the story
from my graphic novel?

297
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:58,982
Oh, yes, story.

298
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:01,051
All the gimmicky stagecraft
in the world

299
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:02,719
ain't worth a tinker's damn

300
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:05,488
without a compelling human story
at the center.

301
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:07,390
Your story,
the unique expression

302
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:09,226
of your heart and soul...

303
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,094
will be neatly summed up

304
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:13,630
in the narrator's first speech.

305
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,098
Once that's out of the way,

306
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:16,967
we can explore the dazzling

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,269
visual buffet of Marge Simpson.

308
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:20,770
Now feast.

309
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,841
Pass the wonderment, please,

310
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:26,476
but save room for the Tonys.

311
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,811
Oh, my God.

312
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,746
It's just how I drew it.

313
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,415
It's your artistic vision
writ large.

314
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:34,517
Or should I say, writ Marge?

315
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:35,986
You should.

316
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,154
He really shouldn't.

317
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,526
It's all in my style.

318
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,498
Mom, he's ignoring my story

319
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,934
and making this all about
your drawings.

320
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:52,936
I know.

321
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,604
I'm sorry, Lisa.

322
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:56,273
But I can't help it
if he wants to focus

323
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:57,841
on the visual part of...

324
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,711
Oh, my God.
It's Bart and Grampa.

325
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,646
But they aren't even in my book.

326
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,815
And where am I?
Where is Sad Girl?

327
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:08,151
Sad Girl will be represented

328
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:10,453
by a voiceless red light
projected into

329
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:12,956
an empty seat in the balcony.
Bold, no?

330
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,525
But how will they know
it's supposed to be me?

331
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,995
Storytelling.

332
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,333
That impish genius is really
cheesing me off.

333
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:26,236
All he's kept from Sad Girl
is Mom's drawings,

334
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:29,839
when it's supposed to be about
my writing and my feelings.

335
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,409
Oh, I'm so sick
of children's feelings.

336
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:33,810
Feed me. Burp me.

337
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,078
Don't sleep for six years.

338
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:37,347
You're forgetting the boundary

339
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,149
between patient and therapist.

340
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:41,919
And you're forgetting
that you did this to me!

341
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,022
Let me tell you something, Lisa.

342
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,924
When you give birth
to something,

343
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:48,758
you have no control over
what it turns into.

344
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,861
All you can do is surrender
to the nightmare.

345
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:54,664
Sorry. I'm just so happy.

346
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:02,339
Never do this.

347
00:17:02,372 --> 00:17:03,907
Here they are.

348
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:07,844
The official Sad Girl
The Theater Experience T-shirts.

349
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:12,415
$45 in the lobby,
of which we keep $1.35.

350
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,352
Oh, baby, we can use that money
to buy a sailboat

351
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,520
with a double-ended
spinnaker pole.

352
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,524
Looks good. I like it.

353
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,026
I like everything.

354
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,929
Really? You seemed a little
cheesed off earlier.

355
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,397
A mother notices.

356
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,200
Mom, Sad Girl was like our baby.

357
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:33,203
And you can't control
what your kid turns into.

358
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:35,138
If it becomes
a successful show,

359
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,906
that will be good
for our family.

360
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,408
Now if you'll excuse me,

361
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,277
I'm gonna go
sit on a swing alone.

362
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,145
Oh, okay.

363
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,880
Hello, Coast Guard?

364
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:46,984
Get ready to search for my body
in about a month.

365
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,993
- So you're okay with this?
- Sure.

366
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:58,495
It's an honor to have something
based on your life.

367
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,830
Even if it's nothing like
your life at all.

368
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,336
<i>Sad Girl</i>

369
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:24,621
What the hell does
any of this mean?

370
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:26,156
What? You don't get this?

371
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,925
It's so stimulating
and I love it.

372
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,130
- What is that?!
- D'oh!

373
00:18:53,516 --> 00:18:57,020
Guthrie, is it possible
we strayed

374
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:00,023
a skoosh too far from what
Lisa's book is about?

375
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:03,126
Marge, this isn't You're A Good
Man, Charlie Brown.

376
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,862
Or even my production of You're
A Good Man, Charlie Brown,

377
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,897
set in a doomed
Soviet submarine.

378
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,301
This is avant-garde theater,
and it is electric.

379
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:17,006
Okay, I guess.

380
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:27,184
Oh, Lisa.

381
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:29,919
I'm so sorry.

382
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:34,557
There, honey. Now you're
back in our show.

383
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,330
What the...? That's not
one of my brain babies.

384
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,811
Which one of us
is me?

385
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,787
Run for your cultural lives!

386
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:08,258
I'm haunted by visions
of Milhouse.

387
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,803
And now to read the reviews.

388
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:23,039
Greatest...
I like where this is going.

389
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:25,375
Disaster in theater
history.

390
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:28,545
Oh, those sons of Bs.

391
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:31,914
Honey, I'm sorry
I let Guthrie make the play

392
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:35,152
all about my drawings,
and also terrible.

393
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:38,888
And I'm sorry I wasn't more open
to your creative input.

394
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:41,057
I blame both of you
for this disaster.

395
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,125
More wine!

396
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,593
I've got another project

397
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:45,128
for us to collaborate on.

398
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,130
Getting your dad
in a cab.

399
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,267
Hello, Coast Guard?
I'm gonna live.

400
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:23,733
Well, I still think
it's good.
