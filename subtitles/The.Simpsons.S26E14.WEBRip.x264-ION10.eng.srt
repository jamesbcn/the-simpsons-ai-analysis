00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,182
some interesting conversation

177
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,761
from those two book clubs.

178
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,965
Well, we thought
<i>The Heaven Lovers' Club</i>

179
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,886
was rich and spiritual.

180
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,845
We thought it was maybe
a little slow.

181
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,396
Oh, well, maybe I can
liven it up for ya!

182
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,400
(grunts)

183
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,402
(screaming)

184
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,243
Let me help you up.

185
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,488
Ow!

186
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,490
MOE (moaning):
Oh, yeah.

187
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,657
Okay, stop here, please.

188
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,081
So this is the charming tavern
you've been telling me about.

189
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,331
Yep, nice and cozy and...

190
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:47,254
Wha...?

191
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,762
(gasps)

192
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,419
My crap hole!

193
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,467
My precious crap hole!

194
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,011
Anyone tries to stop me,

195
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,354
and you'll see her lovely bones
all over the floor!

196
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,888
This is nuts.

197
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,685
Tell me you still work,
Love Tester.

198
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,188
(buzzing)

199
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,770
Oh, I'm ruined!

200
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,015
Sorry, Moe.

201
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,226
I love losers,

202
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,776
but only after they've
bounced at the bottom.

203
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,990
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm the brassiest</i>
<i>piece of sass ♪</i>

204
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,411
<i>♪ In this whole...</i>
<i>damn... town! ♪</i>

205
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,121
Hyah!

206
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,371
You guys cost me my chance
with a woman of a certain age!

207
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,455
(sobs)

208
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,129
Hey, come on, all is not lost.

209
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,381
This coaster's fine.

210
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,303
(howling)

211
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,136
You are not my friends.

212
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,891
To me,
you're just mouths drinking beers.

213
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,394
You can't mean that!

214
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,136
We don't look at you that way.

215
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,359
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry
for snapping at you guys,

216
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,230
but... but I'm ruint!

217
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,487
I'll have to live
on my savings here.

218
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,360
All right,
who rubbed my nickels?!

219
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,953
Hey, wait a minute--
we can get you a job.

220
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,743
There's an opening
at the nuclear plant,

221
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,076
'cause of that guy
that defected to North Korea.

222
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,792
Good old Dae Ho.

223
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,792
Used to give me the pickles off
his sandwich.

224
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,134
And all I had to do
was let him copy some keys.

225
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,251
Moe, can you pass
a background check?

226
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,628
Um...

227
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,304
Eh...

228
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,643
Er, uh...

229
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,838
Eh...

230
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,008
Sure.

231
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,006
Well, then, you're in.

232
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,307
How far do they go back?

233
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,310
Six months.

234
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,142
Okay, I'm gonna apply in a week.

235
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,609
(text alert chimes)

236
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,979
Oh, Mom!

237
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,645
Someone wants you
to give them a ride.

238
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,323
At last! I'll earn money
for schlepping.

239
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,613
Wow, your mom has a job
and my dad still doesn't?

240
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,738
Just wait till winter comes, son.

241
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,615
There'll be driveways to salt!

242
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,082
Long, long driveways.

243
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,496
Thanks for the lift.

244
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,213
It's nice to know
I can get a ride

245
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,463
without having to put out.

246
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,955
You're welcome.

247
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,416
You know, if you really want
to get your belly button pierced,

248
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,257
go see a professional.

249
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,342
I'm ready for you, babe.

250
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,677
(clacking)

251
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,851
I'm gonna have
this done properly,

252
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,929
at a kiosk in the mall.

253
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,314
I'm Shauna.

254
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,847
Welcome to Springfield Nuclear,
Szyslak.

255
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,357
We'll start you off in Janitorial,

256
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,359
but there is room
for advancement.

257
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,741
Hey, I sure appreciate this,
fellas.

258
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,358
What you guys did to me,
then for me,

259
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,106
I'll never forget-slash-forgive,

260
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,657
so thanks a lot.

261
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,701
Also...
(angrily) thanks a lot!

262
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,754
What's for dinner, Mom?

263
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,618
I-I'm-I'm sorry,
but I'm not your mother.

264
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,496
Hey, <i>I'm</i> the one payin'.

265
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,463
Fine! There's meat loaf.

266
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,633
Mmm! What's meat loaf?

267
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,803
Left... left, left!

268
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,342
Left...

269
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,545
Left, left!

270
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,264
Left, left...

271
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,894
Eh... left!

272
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,181
Flamingos turn pink
from eating shrimp.

273
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,845
Cats have over
a hundred vocal cords.

274
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,393
The Golden Gate Bridge
is the longest span

275
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,017
between two towers.

276
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,773
Why are you telling me
all these things?

277
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,185
Isn't this <i>Cash Cab?</i>

278
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,193
No!

279
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,574
Oh! It's never <i>Cash Cab.</i>

280
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,991
Oh...

281
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,450
Faster!

282
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,360
Eh, slower.

283
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,778
Hard a-port!

284
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,946
Disco Stu says hang a "U"!

285
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,745
Make a louie up here at the...

286
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,328
-Stop sign!
-Blood bank!

287
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,663
Girl with big...

288
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,918
...punching bags?

289
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,089
So, for the love of God,
get me to Mexico!

290
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,209
Hey, swabbie,
you've missed spots there,

291
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,717
another one there,
and... there!

292
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,050
Every other spot is be-grimed!

293
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,255
It's called a checkerboard floor,
ya unwrapped mummy.

294
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,597
-You're f...
-Sir...

295
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,981
the NRC is here
for a surprise inspection.

296
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,309
We are gonna search this place
from top to bottom.

297
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,774
(shrieks)
That's where all the problems are.

298
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,065
I'll handle this, uh...

299
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,228
You're the head inspector, huh?

300
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,606
Yes, I am.

301
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,492
How come, on your badge,
you got a mustache,

302
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,239
but now you're not
wearing one, huh?

303
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,701
{\an8}Oh, I was Freddie Mercury
in a Queen cover band,

304
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,412
{\an8}but, uh, then I got demoted
to Brian May.

305
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,913
Yeah, well, I'm thrilled for your
musical career and everything,

306
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,405
but, uh, we got no way of knowing
if this is you.

307
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,868
I mean,
we gotta be careful here.

308
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,628
This is one of them, uh,
highly sensitive joints.

309
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,969
It'll take me weeks
to grow that mustache back.

310
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,968
Or years, to get a new badge!

311
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,890
Yeah, well,
that's your problem, ain't it?

312
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,759
You will see us again,

313
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,926
in God knows when.

314
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,442
Young man, how do you fit
such brilliance

315
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,571
into such an ugly, ethnic head?

316
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,398
Well, if you own a bar,
you either keep it clean

317
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,244
or learn to deal with inspectors.

318
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,819
And Moe don't clean.

319
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,784
Interesting attitude for a janitor.

320
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,905
What say we make you the new
supervisor of Sector 7G?

321
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,543
Me, a supervisor?

322
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,409
I feel like I overdosed
and went to heaven!

323
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,656
(laughs)

324
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,629
Those smart cars
are cutting into our business.

325
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,724
We used to get uber
amounts of work

326
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,129
giving people lifts.

327
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,427
(splutters)

328
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,510
I come to America to drive taxi.

329
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,096
Now my cab sits empty,
like Sochi Marriott.

330
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,851
Well, boss, the main problem
is Marge Simpson!

331
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,855
She's prompt, courteous
and a joy to ride with.

332
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,729
How do you know so much?

333
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,526
Oh, she, uh,
drives me to work every day.

334
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,531
And unlike the rest
of you cowards,

335
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,743
she's not afraid to parallel park.

336
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,870
(laughing, whooping)

337
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,207
Whoa, fellas,
that is not acceptable.

338
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,539
This is a nuclear plant!

339
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,789
Huh. No one was in there.

340
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:24,208
Look, Moe, the least you could let me do
is anything I want.

341
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,128
All right, let me be honest
with youse.

342
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,426
After all the money this plant lost
on that nitwit, Elon Musk,

343
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,851
they're looking for cutbacks,

344
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,140
so I've been going over your record.

345
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,063
(whimpers)

346
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,061
Yeah, the only reason
you haven't been fired

347
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,563
is because your file here

348
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,975
was holding up a sofa
that was missing a leg.

349
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,864
Well, that's the logic--
where's the affection?

350
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,572
Well, as supervisor,
I can't fraternize with the, uh,

351
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,113
what's the word...?

352
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,066
Scum.

353
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,945
Anyway, because I am your friend,
you are safe.

354
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,873
But...
you're gonna be reassigned.

355
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,712
Smithers, "what profit a man
if he gain the world,

356
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,829
and lose his soul?"

357
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,416
Seriously, I need an amount.

358
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,711
In round dollars.

359
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,754
(knocking on door)

360
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,916
Plant watering guy.

361
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,344
Yes, yes, go ahead.

362
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,132
Uh, and be careful
with the Venus flytrap.

363
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,336
All right.

364
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,219
They say you catch
more flies with honey.

365
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,394
I say, with flytraps.

366
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,933
(muffled)
What do I do now?

367
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,306
Just lean into it.

368
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,193
It'll be over soon,
one way or another.

369
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,899
(muffled)
Oh, all right.

370
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,771
D'oh.

371
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,952
Hey, guys, you mind if I join you?

372
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,991
They ran out of Beaujolais Cru
in the executive dining room,

373
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,286
and I ain't drinkin' white
with my coq-au-freakin'-vin.

374
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,251
I think I'd rather
sit somewhere else.

375
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,881
Yeah, I'm gonna take my lunch
back to the core.

376
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,289
Now they won't even
have lunch with me?

377
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:48,298
Well, you know, people <i>can</i>
kind of act like they're in grade school.

378
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,392
Oh, now you gotta throw your
grade school education in my face?

379
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,348
You know, Moe,
you're a real jerk!

380
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,639
I didn't mind so much
when it came with beer!

381
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,934
I don't need youse!

382
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,807
I'm all the company I need! Heh!

383
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,729
Oh! Oh!

384
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,404
I just lost my appetite.

385
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,737
Marge, which can
makes me look cooler--

386
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,530
the Drizzler or Mr. Drip?

387
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,573
(Marge groans wearily)

388
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,907
Aw, your leaves are drooping.

389
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,623

into bloom.

Working with those plants
is great!

394
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,006
It's helped you get in touch
with your feminine side.

395
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,011
Feminine?!

396
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,342
(shrieks)

397
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,257
I didn't mean
to use that word!

398
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,805
I-It's okay to have
a feminine side!

399
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,430
It's good, in fact.

if we quit our new jobs.

416
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,871
You know,
I think you're right there, Midge.

417
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,627
I'm gonna build my bar back up,
better than ever!

How hard can it be, eh?

420
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,591
Oh, God, this is so much worse
than I remember!

421
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:03,024
So, you drop off your lover
and go back to stealing our jobs.

422
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,560
He's not my lover.

423
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,193
Let the man speak!

424
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,600
Medallions!

425
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,531
Air fresheners!

426
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,318
(gasping)

427
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,543
Step away from
the social-media-enabled,

428
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,498
peer-to-peer
ride share platform.

429
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,499
(shouting fearfully)

430
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,830
Now, promise me you'll leave her be

431
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,075
and wipe down
your backseats annually...

432
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,498
Aw, come on!

433
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,746
(gunshot)

434
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,007
Okeydoke.

435
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,418
Now beat it.

436
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,717
Uh, I think it might
be time to hang up

437
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,602
the old beaded seat cover,
there.

438
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,849
Yep. And I know a place
that could use this smile.

439
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,024
Whew!
It's sure great to see you

440
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,812
jerking our suds again, Moe.

441
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,522
Yeah,
I figured out that the best way

442
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,567
for me to get along
with most people

443
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,740
is to be kept behind
a two-foot trunk of solid oak.

444
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,779
(chuckles)

445
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,782
Looks more like poplar to me.

446
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,874
Why, youse correcting me on
my knowledge of wood products?

447
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,540
Don't you slide me down the bar!

448
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,749
(thudding)

449
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,708
So good to be back.

450
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,208
MOE: Oh, shut up.

451
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,085
Well, I'm back where I belong, eh?

452
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,841
(deep voice)
You're not alone anymore.

453
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,973
What the hell was that?

454
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,509
Oh, you'll find out.

456
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,136
