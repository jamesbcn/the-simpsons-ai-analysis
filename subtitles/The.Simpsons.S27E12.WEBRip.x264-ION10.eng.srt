Well, the way we abandoned
our other brother.

157
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,644
What other brother?

158
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,472
All I remember on that boat was you,

159
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,807
the tiger, and the wise, old fox.

160
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,523

161
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,653

All right, my brother.

00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,597
Remember when we used to nod?

176
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,928
(crying) I do, I do.

177
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,104
It is down to just you and me now, store.

178
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,983
Together, nothing can stop us.

179
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,440
Unless they put another store
within three blocks,

180
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,441
which I hear they plan to do.

181
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:43,113
{\an8}And now to lower this photo
to see what is really there.

182
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,074
(gasps)

183
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,324
There,
we gave him one last look at it.

184
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,658
Roll away the photo.

185
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,792
(wheels squeaking)

186
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,078
APU: Quick & Fresh?

187
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,831
Who spells "quick" with a "Q"?

188
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,753
Hey, Uncle Apu.

189
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,082
Jamshed?

190
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,996
Come on, man, Jamshed
died at band camp.

191
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,165
I'm Jay now.

192
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,343
Yup. Check it.

193
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,841
I just bitch-slapped
your Kwik-E-Mart

194
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,842
into the 21st century.

195
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,135
An upgrade?

196
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,048
No!

197
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,773
I will just live in the happy past
one moment longer.

198
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,351
Ah!

199
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,396
Disco Stu is in denial with you.

200
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,409
-(sighs)
-Check it out, Uncle A.

201
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,868
I made this place healthy.

202
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,908
I added softer lighting.

203
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,161
We're even getting
a better class of robber.

204
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,253
I'm afraid I must relieve you
of your spare cash

205
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,658
and a nice bottle of gin.

206
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,747
Ah, Mrs. Peel, shall we?

207
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,094
Okay, those guys are cool,

208
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,760
but still, Jamshed--
I-I'm-I'm sorry, Jay--

209
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,260
I know my customers.

210
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,091
All they want is something
they can eat while driving.

211
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,007
I'd like a heat lamp dog,
please.

212
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,555
Somewhere between
two and six blisters.

213
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,599
I'm sorry,
we don't serve those anymore.

214
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,643
They're a heart attack
shaped like a penis.

215
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,097
Why, you, millennial...

216
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,477
Easy, brah.

217
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,483
Check out our olive bar.

218
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,824
Mmm!

219
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,902
Ha, see,
he doesn't care what he eats.

220
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,237
He just eats things
in that location.

221
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,993
Hey, quit talking like I can't hear.

222
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:13,905
This is my store.

223
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,083
Mine and Sanjay's.

224
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,501
My father's enjoying his retirement.

225
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,419
{\an8}Bubba Watson!

226
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,091
{\an8}You are no Vijay Singh.

227
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,920
Don't forget, my dad owned more
of this place than you did.

228
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,586
Oh, you, I can't... I...
(sighs)

229
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:33,095
Okay, can we move
this discussion into the restroom?

230
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,349
(gasps)
You have a restroom?

231
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,311
-No.
-No.

232
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,310
I saw the whole jam from my seat

233
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,653

Sorry, man, I'm retired.

A little part of me is glad

that Chalmers' crotch
isn't covered in bees.

271
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,243
Really?

272
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,328
Let's put this good Bart to the test.

273
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,254
Thank God, the Department
of Homeland Security

274
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,253
financed this cherry picker
to detangle the flag.

275
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,166
Extend, extend.

277
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,922

unlatch the brake,

289
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,709

rambling stories.

306
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,128
Oh, I guess I'll just have
to turn my hearing aid

00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,934

00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,422
Um, well, yes, a little.

325
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,590
You are ashamed of me?

326
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,998

328
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,587

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

351
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,274
uh, I came in
for the new issue of <i>Toes and Torsos,</i>

352
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,397
but, uh, that can wait.

353
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,193
What's going on here, my friend?

354
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,736
Oh, I lost my store and my identity,

355
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,911
and all I have left is my vest here.

356
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,739
330 million gods,
and not one of them listens to me.

357
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,867
What are you doing?

358
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,293
I leave for one second,

359
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,371
and you're talking like
a Mumbai riverboat pilot.

360
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,576
Bombay!
To me it will always be Bombay!

361
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,747
Not cool, man.

362
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,915
Give me your vest.

363
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,712
No, please, you can't take it.

364
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,586
This vest has a bullet hole
for every time I have been shot.

365
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,934
It is my lucky vest.

366
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,138
I love you, man, but you're fired.
"Fo-evah."

367
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,064
(grunts)
Amateur.

368
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Apu,
you need a visit to Moe's Tavern,

369
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,730
your downward spiral headquarters.

370
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,522
Hey, we're on the cover of this month's
<i>Giving Up Magazine.</i>

371
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,816
(laughs)
Check it out,

372
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,899
that was the last issue ever.

373
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,275
Hey, guys, this is too sad.

374
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,611
We-We gotta help Apu
get his store back.

375
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,117
Yeah, okay, let's see, uh,

376
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,408
-Homer, your boy's no good, right?
-Not much.

377
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,162
Well, why don't you ask him
to pull a prank to help Apu

378
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,365
turn his nice, new store here
back into a rat hole?

379
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,416
Well, I kinda straightened him out.

380
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,130
I was hoping he'd stay that way
till the Marines take him.

381
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,841
You can't think of yourself, Homer.

382
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,091
Apu's always been there for us.

383
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,973
Yeah, except for that hurricane
when he jacked up the prices.

384
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,641
Okay, so I got a little gouge-y,

385
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,220
but I-I don't hold the looting
against you guys.

386
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,056
(scoffs)
Some looting.

387
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,391
I got there late,
and all that was left was a bag of ice,

388
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,807
and they played the clip
on CNN for a week.

389
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,437
But I am one of you now.

390
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,153
I sponsor your Little League teams,

391
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,783
and I sell you Christmas gifts

392
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,820
at 9:00 a.m. on Christmas morning.

393
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,664
Yeah, that Hello Kitty
cell phone cover

394
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,449
really saved my ass with Marge,

395
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,832
and when I think of it,
what do we have children for

396
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,950
if not to sacrifice them
for our needs?

397
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:14,958
ALL:
Hear, hear.

398
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,459
Hear, hear.

399
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,290
Oh, gee, I guess you guys

400
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,126
are gonna have
to buy more beers.

401
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,758
{\an8}(snickers)

402
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,930
HOMER:
(drunkenly) Ba-Bart?

403
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,929
Bart...

404
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,600
Ba-Bart...

405
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,718
Oh, leave me alone.

406
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,555
Listen, boy,
I need you to do a prank for Apu.

407
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,982
I don't get it, man.

408
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,900
You told me to stop pranking,
and I did.

409
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,018
And you know what?

410
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,654
I don't miss it.

411
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,481
Without you strangling me,
my throat is finally healing.

412
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,737
I can sing again.

413
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,318
(clears throat)

414
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:50,163
<i>♪ Praise God</i>

415
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,530

00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,577
<i>♪ All creatures here below... ♪</i>

417
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,002
You know what, you're right.

418
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,000
What was I thinking?

419
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,581
Go back to sleep.

420
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,037
-Dad.
-Yes?

421
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,336
Say someone were to do this prank,

422
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,421
would the prankster
receive a later bedtime?

423
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,718
Say, 9:30?

424
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,722
No, no, you know something, boy,
I realized I made a big mistake.

425
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,385
I like the new,
well-behaved you.

426
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,893
I can stop saving up for that house
near the prison.

427
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,306
("Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary"
by Wendy Carlos playing)

428
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,696
Oh, I never should have bought
that <i>Clockwork Orange</i> video

429
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,280
for his fifth birthday.

430
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,235
I thought it would help him tell time,

431
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,405
and now I've awoken a monster.

432
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,414
LISA:
You awoke me, too.

433
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,576
I thought you were sleeping
over at Rachel's.

434
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,415
Rachel was my imaginary friend
when I was three.

435
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,091
Then when she was five,
she moved to White Plains, New York.

436
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,800
HOMER:
What? I never said good-bye.

437
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,090
Well, they wanted to leave quickly.

438
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,763
Her dad had been caught
in an affair.

439
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,802
Her brother took a semester off college,

440
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,505
and he never went back.

441
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,885
And her mother?

442
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,272
LISA:
Her mother's the really sad story.

443
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,768
Oh, I've-I've heard enough.

444
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,113
My return to prankdom is elegant
in its simplicity.

445
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,610
All we do is cut the power
in the store for 30 seconds.

446
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,994
There's no preservatives
in the food,

447
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,070
so everything will
immediately go bad.

448
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,986
Oh, it's an honor to be
the guy you explain it to.

449
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,996
(panting) Bart, wait!

450
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,578
I like the new you.

451
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,464
Listen,
before you flip those circuit breakers,

452
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,962
look deep in your sister's eyes
and tell me what you see.

453
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,467
I see... love.

454
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,640
Unconditional love.

455
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,059
Which means
I can do whatever I want.

456
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,139
D'oh!

457
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,813
-(power whirrs down)
-(shoppers murmur)

458
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,480
(flies buzzing)

459
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,482
(shoppers gasping, groaning)

460
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,822
Aah! Save us, chemicals!

461
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,242
(sighs)
At least the mushrooms are okay.

462
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,071
That is a wheel of brie!

463
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,077
(gasps)

464
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,908
(screams)

465
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,123
Come on,
this is the cleanest place in town,

466
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,504
and you know it.

467
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,746
Another failed millennial.

468
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,423
Who is a cliché now?

469
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,093
Now to remove all signs
of our presence.

470
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,262
(rattling)

471
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,345
(siren wails, tires screech)

472
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,636
Ah! We must have used it up
during the parade.

473
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,015
Mm, it was a great parade.

474
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,563

478
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,907
I am sorry, nephew.

479
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,580
I was jealous, and karma has exacted
a terrible price.

480
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,411
Word.
And I was kind of a douche wheel.

481
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,827
You know,
even your way of apologizing offends me.

482
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,206
What is this?

483
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,792
(haunting ethereal music)

484
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,837
My ruin and my redemption.

485
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,592
My last two dollars.

486
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,804
I have nothing to scratch it with.

487
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,046
<i>Use me, Apu.</i>

488
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,808
<i>Make my life worth something.</i>

489
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,233
No, Uncle A,
it's a clown move, bruh.

490
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,230
Or maybe, just maybe,
a genius clown move.

491
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,404
Ah!

492
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,732
Sheldon,

493
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,397
Sheldon...

494
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,735
(metal scraping)

495
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,236
Three Sheldons!

496
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,453
It is a winner,
and it is so much money,

497
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,615
which means so many more tickets.

498
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,624
Precious, precious tickets.

499
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,576
I... No, no, it's money.

500
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,996
(kisses)

501
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,169
(tires screech)

502
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,253
(doorbell dings)

503
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,257
Oh, it is so good to see you.

504
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,089
I have my store back, my friend.

505
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,425
But I have something that
I wanted even more, you know,

506
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,430
a feeling that I belong.

507
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,932
I'm glad I could help
by giving my son a little nudge

508
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,766
in the wrong direction.

509
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,231
And now, I have something very,
very special for you, my friend.

510
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:53,033
This is the legendary, jumbo,
golden Squishee cup.

511
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,568
It will be refilled by me,

512
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,901
for free, for the rest of your life.

513
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,657
Holy moly, all those Squishees?

514
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,530
How much is that gonna cost you?

515
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,327
Uh, about three bucks.

516
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,370
(glass shattering)

517
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,584
(chuckles)
This time it's 'cause I let Ralph drive.

518
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,285
I thought it was pretend.

519
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,256
Let it never be said
I cannot admit a mistake,

520
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,221
especially in the middle
of a recall campaign.

521
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,762
We will now destroy
the new Jebediah Springfield statue.

522
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,767
Chief, you may fire when ready.

523
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,599
(shell ricochets, whistling)

524
