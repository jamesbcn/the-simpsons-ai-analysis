Welcome
to the Springfield YMCA.

16
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,422
{\an8}Tonight you can sample
all of our classes for free.

00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,257
{\an8}and if you find one you like,

20
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,853
{\an8}(laughs) I know. We'll never see
any of you again.

to get the ball out of the peach basket.

26
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,697
{\an8}(muttering) I'll get a ball out
of your peach basket one of these days.

27
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,543
Welcome to gymnastics.

28
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,158
{\an8}I am Coach Lugash.

29
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:04,865
{\an8}I came to this country in '83
by cartwheeling over Berlin Wall.

(giggles)

31
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,915
-No giggling! It weakens the haunches!
-(students gasp)

32
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,174
{\an8}What a little angel.
How old are you?

33
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,678
{\an8}-Eight.
-Eight? Too old! Go home, Grandma!

34
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,682
{\an8}I am sorry, little girl.

35
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,734
{\an8}Lugash must go next door
to anger management class.

36
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,560
{\an8}Worthless anger
management class!

37
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:32,107
{\an8}I hate it so much!
I spit on it!

38
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,408
{\an8}Yo, boy, this class is tight.

39
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,778
{\an8}You go from "sloppa"
to "proppa."

40
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,116
{\an8}Cool.

-But the black man said--

43
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,666
{\an8}Are you accusing my husband
of misleading you? Good gracious!

44
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,593
I should bust a cap
in your ass!

45
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,092
Mmm, I'll pick, uh, Carl.

46
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,005
Lenny and Carl.
I kinda like the sound of that.

47
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,434
My turn, huh? Let's see.

48
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,354
{\an8}Pick me! Pick me!
I got hoop dreams, Coach!

{\an8}I got 'em bad!

50
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,099
{\an8}-OK. Homer!
-Yes!

51
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,977
{\an8}Losers! Losers, losers, l--

52
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,475
-You said "Homer," right?
-Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,737
Losers!

54
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,608
I'll take Professor Frink.

55
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,985
{\an8}Ah, you won't regret it,
my good man.

56
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,912
{\an8}What with the passing,
and the dribbling...

57
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,541
{\an8}and my shoes
made of the flubber!

58
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,909
{\an8}And away I go!
It's frightening.

59
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,826
{\an8}Ow, that was painful.
Oh, the flubber is burning my feet!

60
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,207
{\an8}Now before we begin...

61

{\an8}fitness buff Rainier Wolfcastle

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,670
would like to say a few words
about the Springfield YMCA.

63
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,086
(grunts) Oh, hello.

64
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,926
I have purchased
the Springfield YMCA.

65
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,644
I plan to tear it down and turn the land
into a nature preserve...

66
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,396
where I will hunt
the deadliest game of all... man!

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,270
Now let's play ball!

68
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,357
Ooh, and Lenny is taking off!

69
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,659
-(grunts)
-That's a foul.

70
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,988
I am taking the ball
and going home.

71
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,155
Hey! Hey, that's not your ball!

72
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,334
(rifle clicks)
The chase begins.

73
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,583
(gasps)

74
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:15,264
Whoo! You da man, Carl!
I believe you can fly!

75
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,548
Boy, I am so sick of everyone assuming

76
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,342
I'm good at basketball
because I'm African-American.

77
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,716
(grunts)

78
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,427
(chanting)
Go, Carl. Go, Carl.

79
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,846
It's my birthday.
It's my birthday.

80
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,645

You got mail, baby!

81

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,280
Willie tickles the twine
for two! Oy! Oy!

83
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,992
OK, guys. I got a secret play I've been
saving for the Olympics...

84
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,657
or possibly the Final Four.

85
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,995
And it goes something
like this.

86
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,881
(quietly) All right, Skinner,
I want you to block out Carl.

87
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,129
Moe, you can take
Professor Frink.

88
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,171
Homer, you take
Groundskeeper Willie.

89
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,085
No way am I taking
Groundskeeper Willie.

90
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,593
Yes, you are.
Are you a team player or not?

91
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,681
Oh, my goodness,
an untied shoelace.

92
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,387
I'll just get down on one knee
and re-tie that.

93
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,145
(grunts)
Eat my dust, mortals!

94
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,272
(groans) I'm OK.

97
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,622
Homer, I'm afraid
you've torn out

98
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,699
your anterior
cruciate ligament.

99
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,754
-Did you say "anterior"?
-Yes.

100
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,580
(screaming)

101
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,165
Now how did this happen?

102
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,170
{\an8}Maybe a little morphine
would refresh my memory.

103
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,375
{\an8}(chuckles, moans with pleasure)

104
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,296
{\an8}I don't know.
I'm still a little hazy.

105
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,215
{\an8}Ga! Oh, yeah.

106
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,175
{\an8}Now I remember it like
it was yesterday.

107
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,676
It happened today.

108
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,438
Hey, man,
you're harshing my buzz.

109
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,150
Anyway, it all started
when I was--

110
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,319
(straining)

111
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,994
You go, Homer.

112
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,286
-(grunt) Whoosh!
-(crowd cheers)

113
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,829
Ow! Jetson!

114
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,254
We've got to
get you into surgery.

115
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,633
{\an8}Maybe a little morphine
would get me there quicker.

116
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,961
(sighs)

117
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,506
{\an8}(moans)

118
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,350
So many times we've
seen our father go under the knife.

119
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,058
One more and I get
a free hysterectomy.

120
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,516
Now, Homer, you'll have a full recovery
from your spinal cord injury.

121
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,774
-What spinal cord injury?
-Oh, he fell off the gurney.

122
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,607
But it will take plenty of time and rehab
before you can go back to work.

123
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,534
Miss work? But my life would be nothing
without the nucleon plant.

124
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,035
Oh, you're also responsible
for this hefty hospital bill.

125
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,329
You shouldn't have
ordered all those

126
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,582
hospital haircuts
and porno films.

127
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,924
But Doctor Screwlittle
sounded like a delightful romp.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,250
{\an8}But you don't have to
worry about the bill.

129
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,836
{\an8}We've never welshed on a--
Look, a bear!

130
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,472
Run!

131
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,009
-(snapping)
-Ow.

132
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,560
(growling)

133
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,274
Now, Homer, I want you
to stay off that leg for two weeks.

134
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,065
Two weeks?
What am I supposed to do?

135
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,150
Just sit on my ass and watch TV?
That ain't my style, man.

136
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,697
Now, Homer, there are people
right through that door

137
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,781
that have it much
worse than you.

138
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,827
(sniff) No, they don't.

139
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:38,123
Mmm, everyone's
having fun but me.

00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:42,337

-Boingy, boingy, boingy, boingy, boingy.

141
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,130
Mrs. Simpson,
can Homer come out and play?

142
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,224
No, Homer won't be able to play
for a long time.

143
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,801

Would you make me some Jell-O?

145
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,348
(sighs) Well, I can still hang out
with you guys.

146
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,475
Sorry. I got a baseball game
in 15 minutes.

147

00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,629
{\an8}-(dog whines)
-No. That's not how you do it! (gasps)

171
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,174
-(yowls)
-Quitters!

172
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,048
-(dog yelping)
-Hey, Homer.

173
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,390
Oh, it feels so good to talk
to another human being!

174
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,222
Stupid Flanders.

175
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,847
Hey, Homer, I need
to ask you a favor.

176
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,314
My babysitter canceled, and I got tickets
to a Christian rock concert.

177
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,936
(laughs) It's gonna be
one wholesome evening.

178
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,994
So, you think Marge could take care of
Rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?

179
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,530
Well, Marge isn't here. She had
to identify a body at the morgue.

180
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,460
That's not my Uncle Lou.
And this man's not dead.

181
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,129
That's what I've been
trying to tell you!

182
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,999
-That's just gas escaping.
-(cries)

183
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,217
Would you mind watching the kids?
I'm kinda in a pickle here.

184
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,379
Well, they would
keep me company.

185
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,797
And this pickle you're offering
only sweetens the deal.

186
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,757
(cheering on TV)

187
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,177
(grunts)

188
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,521
Mr. Simpson, can we have another
jelly and candy sandwich?

189
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,186
Sure. Knock yourselves out.

190
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,034
-And call me Homer.
-(boys gasp)

191
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,649
Daddy said it's rude to call
grown-ups by their first name.

192
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:17,948
-Daddy's not here, is he?
-(all laugh)

193
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,075
(cheering on TV)

194
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,463
Now, my good man,
what do you like to play?

195
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,590
-Pokémon!
-Pokémon? Pokémon?

196
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,298
With the pokey and the man...
and the... (blabbering)

197
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,339
...the guy comes
out of the (blabbering)

198
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,059
-(all laugh)
-That is the darnedest thing.

199
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,019
So did you boys
have a good time?

200
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,639
Yeah. Mr. Simpson
was really funny.

201
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,107
He told us how the world
keeps screwing him over.

202
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,939
(laughs) Yeah. Well,
how was the concert?

203
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:55,065
Well, sir, I've never heard a preacher use
the "M-F" word so many times.

204
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,164
Anyway, thanks again.

205
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,869
Hey, it was fun.
My kids are sick of all my stories.

206
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,411
But they just can't
get enough of me.

207
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,536
Can Mr. Simpson
watch us every day?

208
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,343
{\an8}(laughs) Oh, Roddy,
he's not running a day care center.

209
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,838
Don't tell me
what I'm not doing.

210
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,630
So you are running
a day care center?

211
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,593
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

212
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,344
Oh, I sure would. It would give the boys
a place to go after school.

213
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,307
Then I'll do it,
just to see the look on your face.

214
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,805
That's the one.

00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,694
Why did you put
my name on the sign?

218
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,863
It's just a legal thing
to protect me.

219
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,243
Is your knee
really gross under there?

220
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,950
-See for yourself.
-Ew!

221
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,702
-Can I touch it?
-Sure. Go for the gusto.

222
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,325

It's healing over my hand.

00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,917
I would like to take
advantage of your baby prison.

226
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,386
-We're calling it day care.
-Yes, whatever. Just take them!

227
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,098
Aw, aren't they sweet?

228
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,139
-Any medical things I should know about?
-APU: Yes, probably!

229
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,020
Why, Homer, your surgical incision
is completely healed.

230
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,976
I owe it all to my rewarding work
with children.

231
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,437
And not picking at it.

232
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,487
Ah, yes, how is your
day care center doing?

233
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,611
Wonderful!

234
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,237
Being with those kids gives me a high
only morphine can top.

235
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,615
-You got any?
-(chuckles) Always with the morphine.

236
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,915
(chuckles) Mmm.

237
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,627
Peekaboo! Peekaboo!
Peekaboo! Peekaboo!

238
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,803
Dad's been doing that
for two hours!

239
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,052
I've never seen the baby
get tired of it before the adult.

240
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,774
-(chuckles) Peek... a... boo!
-(whines)

241
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,638
Uncle Homer, will you sing
that crazy song we love?

242
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,016

248
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,371
I can't remember the last time
Dad sang us a torch song.

249
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,366
Yeah!

250
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,667
Hey, Homer, I thought you were
only gonna do this day care thing

251
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,881
till your knee was better.

252
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,010
Yes. But then I discovered
the joys of raising children.

253
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,879
-What about us?
-Don't worry, honey.

254
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,217
You'll have children
of your own someday.

255
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,513
Then you'll know my joy.

256
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,228
Hey, Bart, your dad gave me
this temp tattoo.

257
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,443
{\an8}It's so cool!

258
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,694
(making motorcycle noises)

259
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,275
You have the "bestest" dad.

260
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,784
He read me
a story about Chinese food.

261
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,286
You haven't seen the real Homer.
It's all burping and neglect.

262
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,460
I think we know your dad
a little bit better than you do, Bart.

263
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,961
Is that my jacket?

264
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,672
-He said it looked better on me!

00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,891
(all laugh)

270
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,603
They're always laughing.
Laughing at nothing.

271
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,515
How come parents are always
nicer to other kids

272
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,943
than they are
to their own?

273
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,271
I guess Dad just
takes us for granted.

274
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,027
Well, don't worry.

275
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,029
This'll give his heartstrings
a much-needed plucking.

276
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,373
(laughs)

277
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,490
Huh?

278
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,866
Aw, what a beautiful frame.

279
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,576
Perfect for my day care permit.

280
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,337
Sweet.

281
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,249
Mm-hmm.

282
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,257
(both groan)

283
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:49,307
Hang on, everybody!
Three... two... one, blast off!

284
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,639
(screaming and laughing)

285
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,885
That was "tree-mendous!"

286
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,897
(chuckles) Where's Ralph?

287
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,019
I almost died!

288
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,071

is from the Good Guy Awards.

life better for the community.

291
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,735
-I contributed by not objecting too much.
-Aw, that's my girl.

292
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,457
Anyway, this film crew will shoot some
behind-the-scenes footage

293
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,118
of your amazing work.

294
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,076
-Is there a snack table?
-It's already set up.

295
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,207

296
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,335
{\an8}Don't film this!

297
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,846
Uh, excuse me.
This is a hot set. No visitors.

298
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,469
-It's my room.
-Well, if you want, you can sit on this.

299
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,557
(grumbling)

300
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,732
Teamsters are sleeping
in my room.

301
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,730
MAN:
We're just resting our eyes.

302
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,732
'Cause the thing is,
there are no bad kids.

303
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,935
Ow! You stepped on my arm!

304
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,816
Sorry. Daddy thought
you were a pile of cable.

305
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,994
Tell me about
the Homer Cares Program.

306
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,953
My kids wear these hearts
to remind them they are always loved.

307
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,615
Aww. Did you make 'em yourself?

308
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,334
Yes. Through the magic of caring.

309
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,955
Night will come soon.

310
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,502
There's gotta be a way
to get back at Dad.

311
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:06,298
Well, I've been cutting
the felt kind of crooked.

312
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,552
No. We've gotta show the world
what Dad's really like.

313
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,505
Then everything
will be back to normal.

314
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:16,476
(sinister laughing)
Back to normal.

315
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,938
BOTH: (laughing)

-(music stops)

319
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,660
One more line, and we have to pay
for the song!

320
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:38,212
-Now, is anyone here from Springfield?
-You know we are!

321
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,958
Oh, tough crowd.
(laughs)

322
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,712
So what's in the news?

323
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:48,924
Oh, right.
The bus disaster-- very sad.

324
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,548
Now our first award
is for biggest people pleaser.

325
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,176
You can walk all over
these doormats. (laughs)

00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,515
-And the nominees are...

327
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,560
{\an8}Ned Flanders,
Principal Seymour Skinner...

328
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,816
and Mother Teresa Junior.

329
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,645
And the winner is...
Principal Skinner!

330
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,703
-(grunts)
-(growls)

331
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:17,701
(chuckles) Now I'm told
there's a glitch in our Internet webcast.

332
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:23,666
So all of you out there, type Control,
backslash, semicolon, Alt, dot, Escape,

333
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,751
and you'll be fine.

334
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,086
-(grunts) Ah, perfect.
-(beeps)

335
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,472
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

336
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,640
We'd like to thank our sponsor,
Hansen's Hypno-Coins.

337
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,391
If you can find a sturdier
hypno-coin,

338
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,814
-you buy it.
-(applause)

339
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,652
Now, every year we find
one Good Samaritan so deserving

340
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,399
that not recognizing him

341
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,071
would make Santa Claus himself
vomit with rage.

342
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,401
(groans)
Who writes this stuff?

343
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,121
{\an8}(chimp chitters)

344
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,739
(growls)

345
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,333
This year's winner of The Saint Who Walks
Among Us Award...

346
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,003
Please let me win this, Lord,
'cause if you don't--

347
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,884
KRUSTY:
...Homer Simpson!

348
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,920
-Yes!
-(cheering and applause)

349
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,304
All my love has come back
in trophy form.

350
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,972
Now let's take a look
at Homer's wonderful work.

351
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,513
<i>MAN </i>(narrating): <i>It looks like</i>
<i>any other home in America.</i>

352
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,927
But this is the house
that love built.

353
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,726
KIDS: (grunting)

354
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,560
-(engine hums)
-(tires screech)

355
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,691
(laughs)

356
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:36,622
<i>MAN </i>(narrating): <i>His scabby red knee</i>
<i>became an infectious beacon of hope.</i>

357
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,078
Aww.

358
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,250
<i>MAN </i>(narrating): <i>I guess you could sum up</i>
<i>Homer in two words:</i>

359
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,290
-BART: Big phony!
-(gasp)

360
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,424
This is the real Homer Simpson-

361
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,671
-A beer-drinking meanie!
-(sniffs)

362
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,463
(groans)

363
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,628
Huh?

364
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,425
-And he gambles like crazy.
-(laughs)

365
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,676
-I'll call.
-Three nines.

366
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,143
Oh! I almost had a straight!

367
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,274
Come to new papa.

368
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,151
-(gasping, murmuring)
-Hey, what's the deal?

369
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,899
We just spliced in some home movies.
What do you think?

370
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,953
Well, I'd rather reserve
judgment until l-- Oh, my God!

371
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,198
<i>-I'll mace you good!</i>
-(screams)

372
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,622
-(gasps)
-That is completely taken out of context!

373
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,423
-Why you little--
-(both screaming)

374
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,168
Our children aren't safe
with that monster!

375
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,591
Yeah, keep away from him, Milhouse!

376
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,090
You too, Ralphie.
You're out of that day care center.

377
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,473
Oh! My polite indignation
knows no bounds!

378
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,891
(grunts) No! No!

379
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,430
No one is taking
my kids from me!

380
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,524
(grunts)
Run, children, run!

381
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,851
MAN: Come back here
with my young'un!

382
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:54,113
The term "soccer mom"
is thrown around all too often these days.

383
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,403
But the nominees in our next category...

384
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,156
-(chattering)
-Where are we going?

385
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,330
Uh, for frosty chocolate
milk shakes! (insane laugh)

386
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,700
Frosty chocolate milk shakes!

387
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,575
(tires screeching)

388
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,876
An award ceremony erupted
in kidnapping tonight,

389
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,090
as alleged "Good Guy" Homer Simpson
absconded with several children

390
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,922
in a stolen paddy wagon.

391
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,547
Now let's go to Arnie Pie
in the Sky.

392
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,505
-(sirens wailing)
-ARNIE: I can see them right below me.

393
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,925
I'm gonna try to nail the driver
with one of my shoes.

394
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,394
Arnie, please leave this
to the police.

395
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,225
I'm sick of being a reporter.
I want to make the news!

396
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,691
Arnie, this is not the time!

397
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,401
You're not the time, Kent!
You're not the time!

398
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,992
Where are we going, Mr. Simpson?

399
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,489
I'll tell you where we're not going.

400
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,701
-Jail!
-Then you better turn.

401
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,122
-Uh-oh! Aaah!
-(tires screech)

402
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,002
(groaning)

403
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,499
ARNIE: He's jumping
out of the car, Kent!

404
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,961
He's trying to climb
over the fence!

405
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,042
Now he's realizing
he's too fat.

406
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,707
-He's digging a hole like a dog.
-(Homer sobbing)

407
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,927
Now he's given up on that
and he's running back and forth.

408
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,508
He's climbing into a pipe
and he seems to be stuck.

409
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,845
His legs are dangling
in a comical fashion.

410
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,391
Oh, it's the saddest thing
I've ever seen.

411
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,435
KENT: Arnie, Arnie,
how are the children?

412
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,689
ARNIE: I can't see through metal, Kent!

413
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,232
All right, Fatty.
Out of the pipe!

414
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,450
Why did you rat me out, kids?

415
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,409
Was it because I showered love on those
other children while ignoring you?

416
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,871
-Yep.
-Pretty much.

417
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,581
Well, I learned my lesson.

418
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,291
From now on, you two are the only kids
I'll care about.

419
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,332
Oh, and Maggie.

420
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,955
Now let's all enjoy
the snack table while we still have it.

421
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,553
The teamsters said
they'd pick it up by 5:00.

422
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,379
Yeah. That'll happen.

423
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,684
(all laugh)

424
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,889
HOMER: Teamsters.

425
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,010
(theme music playing)

426
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,973
-BILL COSBY: <i>Pokémon? Pokémon?</i>
-Shh.

427
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,684
With the pokey and the man...
and the... (blabbering)

428
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,725
where if a guy
comes out of... (blabbering)

429
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,058
