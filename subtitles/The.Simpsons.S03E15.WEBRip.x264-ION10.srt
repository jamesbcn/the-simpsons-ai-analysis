So, if I could just have
my yo-yo back...

160
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,272
Bart, if I were you,
and you were me,

161
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,891
would you give back
the yo-yo?

162
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,687

00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,368
Huh?

185
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,870
"One plus one equals two?"

186
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:44,924
"Write Edna K. Box 402."

187
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,087
Hmm.

195
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,780

196
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,947
Oh, Woodrow!

197
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,246
(yeowling)

198
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,879
Maybe we should
let the dog in.

199
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,549
Marge, dogs love the outdoors.

200
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,089
(whimpering)

201
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,594
MARGE:
I think he needs a doghouse.

202
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,005
Yeah, but what
are ya' gonna do?

203
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,143
I bet we could buy
a nice doghouse for $50.

204
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,352
Marge, you're a tool
of the doghouse makers.

205
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,603
I am not.

206
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,854
Yes, you are.

207
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,096
You've been brainwashed

208
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,147
by all those doghouse
commercials on TV.

209
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,732
I know. I'll build
him a doghouse.

210
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,107
Oh, I don't know.

211
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,034
Don't worry.

212
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,032
I just drew up
a little blueprint.

213
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,874
Let me walk you through it.

214
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,330
This is a door.

215
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,989
He goes through that--

216
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,788
This is a roof.

217
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,251
And this happy character here
is the Sun.

218
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,002
He shines down
on the house, see?

219
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,085
How was detention
today, dear?

220
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,669
Oh, not bad.

221
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,014
I'm starting to get
the hang of the floor-waxer.

222
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,764
Yes!

223
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,433
MRS. KRABAPPEL:
<i>Dear Woodrow,</i>

224
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,932

<i>You're not like</i>

00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,523
<i>the other men I've met.</i>

226
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,848
Yeah, I'm the 28th president
of the United States.

227
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,185
<i>But I've had some bad</i>

228
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,771
<i>So, I'd like to learn more about you,</i>
<i>please write back soon.</i>

229
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,897
<i>Here's a photo that will</i>
<i>get your pencil moving.</i>

230
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,657
You've got a date
with the Xerox machine.

231
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,319
(grunting and groaning)

232
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,658
Stupid lumber.

233
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,042
Damn it!

234
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,159
D'oh! I--

235
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,365
Oh, the hell with this!

236
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,665
A fellow came in to the store today,
asked for change for a dollar.

237
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,250
Well, sir, I gave him three
quarters by mistake.

238
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,336
Took me the whole afternoon
to track him down.

239
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,882
Todd, would you like
some mixed vegetables?

240
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,875
Hell no.

241
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,876
(gasping)

242
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,387
What did you say?

243
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,258
I said, I don't want
any damn vegetables.

244
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,965
All right, that's it, young man!

245
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,965
No Bible stories for you
tonight.

246
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,267
(crying)

247
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,852
Weren't you
a little hard on him?

248
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:05,897
Well, you knew
I had a temper

249
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,230
when you married me.

250
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,225
Ned Flanders
is on the phone.

251
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,358
Oh, if this is about
that stupid quarter again, I...

252
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,616
Hello, Ned.

253
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,288
Sorry to bother you, Reverend Lovejoy,
but I'm kind of in a tizzy...

254
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,078
Our son Todd just told us

255
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,582
he didn't want to eat
his "damn vegetables."

256
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,253
Well, you know
kids and vegetables.

257
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,543
What was it, asparagus?

258
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,706
No, no, Reverend.

259
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,253
The point is he said a bad word.

260
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,917
Oh. Oh, right.

261
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,085
Well, kids usually pick
these things up from someplace.

262
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,795
Find out who's doing it
and uh, direct them to the Bible.

263
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,217
Where in the Bible?

264
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,595
-Uh... page 900.
<i>-But, Rev--</i>

265
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,305
Damn Flanders.

266
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,016
Hey, Lis,
a moment of your time.

267
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,435
Yeah?

268
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,033
Suppose I was writing
a second letter to a girl

269
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,818
and I already used up
my "A" material.

270
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,362
What should I say?

271
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,945
Ooh, could it be
there's a special someone

272
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,160
you're not
telling me about?

273
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,279
Oh please!

274
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,276
-Is it Teri?
-No.

275
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,617
-Is it Sheri?
-No!

276
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,411
Is it that girl
with the lazy eye patch?

277
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,745
No!

278
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,249
Is it that exchange student
Mix-pa?

279
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,251
No! It's not for me.

280
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,333
It's... homework.

281
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,787
Sure it is.

282
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,457
Hey, Bart,

Is this all he watches?

289
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,057
He used to watch
"Davy and Goliath"

290
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,607
but he thought the idea
of a talking dog

291
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,651
was blasphemous.

292
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,735
Hey, Mom, did you save
the love letters Dad sent you?

293
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,031
Of course I saved them.

00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,695

<i>three-eighths of your beauty.</i>

358
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,676
Whoa, slow down, Frenchy.

359
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,345
This stuff is gold.

360
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,273
Wow! "A million poets working
for a million years..."

361
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,864
You're so lucky.

362
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,939
When are you
going to meet him?

363
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,533
First, I ask him
to send a photo.

364
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,609
If he's got everything
where it should be

365
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,614
I'm reeling him in.

366
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,065
(laughing)

367
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,910
Strap on your skates, Gordie.

368
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,204
You're going in.

369
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,828
Hey, Marge, do you want
to hear something funny?

370
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,585
Flanders thinks
I swear too much.

371
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,548
(giggling)

372
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,008
Marge, you're not laughing.

373
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,798
Well, you know,
maybe he's right.

374
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,682
Well, what a surprise.

375
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,388
Marge sticks up
for Flanders.

376
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,468
Can we have
one conversation

377
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,184
where you don't bring up
your hero Ned Flanders?

378
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,635
Actually Homer,
you brought up Ned Flanders.

379
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,765
Look, we're past that.

380
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,271
Marge!
Maybe I do curse a little,

381
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,363
but that's the way God made me,
and I'm too old to stop now.

382
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,770
No, you're not.

383
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,478
When my father got
out of the Navy,

384
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,568
he used to curse
a blue streak.

385
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,113
It almost cost him his job
as a baby photographer.

386
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,947
So my Mom put a swear jar
in the kitchen.

387
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,785
Every time he said
a bad word,

388
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,290
he put in a quarter.
What do you think?

389
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,792
Well, Marge,

390
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,714
self-improvement has always
been a passion of mine.

391
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,013
Bring on the swear jar.

392
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,048
Do I have to pay
if I hit my hand with a hammer?

393
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,092
Yes, Homer.

394
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,835
-What if I catch on fire?
-No, Homer.

395
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,677
What if I see something
really weird in the sky?

396
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,762
Yes, Homer.

397
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,886
-What about when we snuggle?
-Hmm... that's okay.

398
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,854
MISS KRABAPPEL:
<i>"Dear Woodrow, it's time for us to meet.</i>

399
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,017
<i>"Why don't we go out to dinner?</i>

400
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,855
<i>And afterward, we can go to</i>
<i>my apartment for some home cookin'."</i>

401
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,612
Huh?

402
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,033
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

403
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,911
<i>"Hungrily yours, Edna."</i>

404
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,239
Well, she's dangled
on the line long enough.

405
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,744
It's time to boat this bass.

406
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:57,916
<i>"When I read your letters, I feel</i>
<i>as if you are right here watching me."</i>

407
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,208
-Bart! Eyes down.
-Yes, Ma'am.

408
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,592
BART:
<i>"Edna, every second until we meet</i>

409
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,920
<i>"stabs me like</i>
<i>a thousand needles.</i>

410
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,875
WOODROW: <i>"Join me at</i>
<i>the Gilded Truffle this Saturday at 8:00.</i>

411
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,086
<i>"Perhaps later</i>
<i>we will smooch up a storm.</i>

412
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,807
<i>Sexily yours, Woody."</i>

413
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,685
(laughing)

414
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,655
(laughing)

415
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,778
(Bart sighing)

416
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,744
Huh?

417
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,500
(crying)

418
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,089
Oh, I can't help but feel
partly responsible.

419
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,593
-Homer, that was a 20.
-Da--

420
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,060
Oh, you son of a--

421
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,361
Homer, I owe you one, buddy.

422
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,609
No sooner had I shaved off
the old cookie duster

423
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,821
than a lady cast me
in a commercial.

424
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,951
I tell ya' the way these checks
keep coming in-- it's almost criminal.

425
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,070
You dirty bast--

426
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,158
What do you think,
Lisa?

427
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,163
How's the dog
supposed to get in?

428
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,825
Well, he just goes...

429
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,833
Ohh!

430
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,792
(snoring)

431
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,706
(screams)

432
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,763
(sighing)

433
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,391
Oh, Woodrow,
how could you stand me up?

434
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,099
Mrs. K., whoever this guy is,
you don't need him.

435
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,850
There are plenty
of good men around.

436
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,141
Name one.

437
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,314
What's wrong
with Principal Skinner?

438
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,102
Seymour? Hmph.

439
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,766
Let's just say his mommy
won't let him out to play.

440
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,855
What about Coach Fortner?

441
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,230
Glug, glug, glug, glug...

442
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,987
Wow.

443
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,319
What about Groundskeeper Willy?

444
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,034
Ugh! I'm not even gonna tell
you what that guy's into.

445
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,945
Bart, you are the closest
thing to a man in my life.

446
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,996
And that's so depressing,
I think I'm going to cry.

447
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,752
(sobbing)

448
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,915
(groaning)

449
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,047
Aah..!

450
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,011
Oh, fudge... that's broken.

451
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,763
Fiddle-dee-dee.

452
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,684
That will require
a tetanus shot.

453
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,644
I'm not going to swear

454
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,144
but I am going

455
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,386
to kick this doghouse down!

456
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,808
(ranting)

457
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,147
Dad, this is not
a commentary on your skills,

458
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,363
but we bought you
a new doghouse.

459
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,033
Where'd you get the money?

460
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,322
There was more than enough
in the swear jar,

461
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,945
and if you look inside the doghouse,
there's a little surprise.

462
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,200
Maggie.

463
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,286
Oh, cute.

464
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,831
No, behind her.

465
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,834
(gasps)

466
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,875
Beer!
How did you know?

467
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,670
Where's Maggie?
Where's Maggie?

468
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,415
There's Maggie!

469
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,717
(makes raspberries
on her belly)

470
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,512
Mom, this is a little
ahead of schedule

471
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,965
but I need help
with my love life.

472
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:04,686
Oh, my special little guy
has a sweetheart.

473
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,728
(snickering)

474
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,191
I knew it!

475
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,981
Alright Bart,
who's your girlfriend?

476
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,024
Mrs. Krabappel.

477
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,857
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

478
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,192
(whistles)

479
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,317
Bart, this is your teacher?

480
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,614
I should start going
to parent's night.

481
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,618
(growls)

482
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,909
Homer!

483
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,872
Bart, you did a
very cruel thing.

484
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,912
Boy, you've got to go
to your teacher

485
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,326
and tell her
the truth.

486
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,964
No, Homer. The truth
would humiliate her.

487
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,881
Oh Marge, I only said it because I thought
that's what you wanted to hear.

488
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,131
Maybe we should
write her another letter

489
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,013
One that says good-bye,
but let's her feel loved.

490
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,551
Step aside, everyone.

491
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,724
Sensitive love letters
are my specialty.

492
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,604
"Dear Baby,
Welcome to Dumpville.

493
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,233
Population: you."

494
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,690
We'll all help.

495
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,360
"Though I'll be inoculating
babies in Kampuchea,

496
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,980
my heart will
always be with you."

497
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,226
That sucks.

498
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,028
How about "crocodiles
bit off my face"?

499
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,952
That's disgusting,
and besides,

500
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,741
when a woman loves a man,

501
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,954
it doesn't matter that
a crocodile bit off his face.

502
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,575
I may hold you
to that, Marge.

503
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:09,672
Okay, okay. "I cannot see you
for the next five years,

504
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,380
for I will be farming
the ocean floor."

505
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,670
(buzzes)

506
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,553
"I must finish
this letter quickly,

507
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,260
for I have only
four minutes to live."

508
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,221
Three simple words:
"I am gay."

509
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,933
Homer, for the last time,
I am not putting that in.

510
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,354
"And anytime I hear
the wind blow,

511
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,063
it will whisper the name...
Edna."

512
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,104
Oh, that's very good, Lisa.

513
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,068
"P.S.: I am gay."

514
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,818
(both groaning)

515
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,400
How shall we end it?

516
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,025
How about, "With a love that
will echo through the ages."

517
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,452
-Aww.
-Ooh!

518
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,700
That's sweet.

519
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,952
Homer, you old
honey dripper.

520
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,374
Why, you little...
hee, hee.

521
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,923
Huh?

522
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,967
Wait!

523
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,220
Wait!

524
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,224
WOODROW:
<i>"Dearest Edna, I must leave you.</i>

525
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,097
<i>"Why? I cannot say.</i>

526
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,984
<i>"Where? You cannot know.</i>

527
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,732
<i>"How I will get there?</i>

528
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,984
<i>"I haven't decided yet.</i>

529
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,146
<i>"But one thing</i>
<i>I can tell you,</i>

530
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,355
<i>"any time I hear</i>
<i>the wind blow,</i>

531
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,025
<i>it will whisper</i>
