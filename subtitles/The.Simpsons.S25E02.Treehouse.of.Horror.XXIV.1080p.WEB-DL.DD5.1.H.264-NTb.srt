to lengthen Bart's life for a year

172
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,685
while shortening yours by 30.

173
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,645
I thought I was donating blood.

174
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:52,823
You are. Along with lymph, spinal fluid,
and all the trimmings. (chuckles)

175
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:55,588
But, Lisa, your brain is
still in complete control.

176
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:59,108
I could do what
I want to Bart's head?

177
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:02,623
Aw, geez. 
Strangle me out of this, Fatso.

178
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,867
Why you little...! I'll teach you 
to make medical history!

179
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:08,829
Oops.

180
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:12,670
Ah, all good.

181
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:13,683
D'oh!

182
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,680
(neck cracks)

183
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,941
(humming)

184
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,839
(spits)

185
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:24,611
Hey, boy, since you don't need a bedroom
anymore, I finally get my man cave.

186
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:26,575
♪ Man cave!

187
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,729
♪ Everyone's welcome
to my man cave! ♪

188
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:39,458
I assure you, we've spared no effort to
accommodate your special-needs student.

189
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:41,264
And... done.

190
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:44,469
So, in conclusion,
my show-and-tell is...

191
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:45,954
this!

192
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:49,043
Excellent, Lisa.
A-plus.

193
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:50,562
Bart, your turn.

194
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,392
Well, my show-and-tell is
that I'm on Lisa's body.

195
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:56,982
Derivative and repetitive!
F-minus.

196
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,762
- Aw!
- (giggles)

197
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,065
Bart, I expected more
from a fourth-grade head.

198
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:04,068
(gasps)

199
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:07,578
You're rotating it
in the wrong direction!

200
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:09,821
(both grunting)

201
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,651
That was gonna be
my show-and-tell!

202
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,722
Bart, Lisa, I'm afraid you two are
going to be together for a long time.

203
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:20,706
Why don't you try to say
something good about each other?

204
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,198
Well, she's pretty healthy for someone
who's been living with cooties.

205
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:26,537
Bart, aren't Lisa's ears clean?

206
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,406
Yeah. It's like looking
down a Canadian tunnel.

207
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,056
- What else?
- Well...

208
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:33,644
now I always have
someone to eat lunch with.

209
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,210
Great!

210
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,629
That's as much therapy
as your parents can afford.

211
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,800
I think we've made
some progress here.

212
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,569
Great...

213
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:45,492
Oh, and I have this 
"two heads for one" coupon.

214
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:46,733
Well, that's for lettuce.

215
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,877
How about this one? "One random disorder
free with every schizophrenia."

216
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:53,050
That's mine, but it's expired.

217
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:53,863
D'oh!

218
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:56,558
(playing "When the
Saints Go Marching In")

219
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,564
Should've chopped off
Bart's head long ago.

220
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:10,710
Sleep well, Lis. Somehow, sewing my head on
your shoulder brought us closer together.

221
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:11,718
Rainbow...

222
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,108
oh, Rainbow...

223
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,960
Oh... not the pony dream again.

224
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,992
(gasps)

225
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:19,973
Hey, <i>I</i> did that.

226
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,719
Yep, that's me.

227
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,953
When she's asleep, I'm in control.

228
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,912
Lis, I'm gonna make
sure you stay asleep.

229
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:32,152
(laughs evilly)

230
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:38,612
Ooh, mix-ins!

231
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:41,365
Mmm.

232
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:42,753
(snores)

233
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:44,612
(falls down stairs,
grunts, shouts)

234
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,762
Son of a...

235
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:46,803
(grunts)

236
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:47,846
(snoring)

237
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:53,327
(engine sputters, dies)

238
00:12:53,345 --> 00:12:56,571
You start a car as well
as you start a family.

239
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:59,506
You wait here while I go
get the jumper cables.

240
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:04,046
MRS. SKINNER:
Oh, a panic attack, huh?

241
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,937
Well, I'll give you
something to panic about!

242
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:08,286
(grunting)

243
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:10,312
(groans)

244
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:15,529
Now I'll just cut off her annoying
head and this body will be all mine.

245
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:16,754
Or we both die.

246
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,902
Not really sure
what the rules are.

247
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:19,738
(gasps)

248
00:13:19,818 --> 00:13:22,901
Why, Bart?
I thought we were friends.

249
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,047
A brother can never
be friends with his sister.

250
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:28,139
- Are you really, really sure?
- I'm afraid I am.

251
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,274
Well, then, I guess
I have no choice.

252
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,620
(yells)

253
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,647
How could this go wrong?

254
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,882
'Cause in a head-to-head battle,
the one with the most brains wins!

255
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:38,137
(groans)

256
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:41,635
(groans)

257
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:45,430
Well, wherever I am,
it's gotta be an improvement.

258
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:46,886
Guess again.

259
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:48,180
(moans)

260
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,864
Now I can always
sing karaoke duets.

261
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:52,387
- ♪ Mock...
- Yeah.

262
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:53,943
- ♪ Ing...
- Yeah.

263
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:55,725
I feel your pain, brother.

264
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:59,727
Now, I need you to memorize these
10,000 setups by next week.

265
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:00,931
Help me, Doctor.

266
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:04,381
So this is what successful
post-op looks like.

267
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:10,508
(circus music plays)

268
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:14,537
BURNSUM: <i>Step right up.</i>
Step right up, only two bits!

269
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,594
(snickering)

270
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:21,239
(slurps, growls)

271
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:23,646
Thrill as...

272
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:28,240
Thrill as Marguerite
conquers the air!

273
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:36,882
(cheering)

274
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,924
Laugh at the clown's buffoonery!

275
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:42,791
Seriously, folks, I really think
we should stop this Hitler guy.

276
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,649
(laughing)

277
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:49,468
Disbelieve, as the Strong Man pulls
a wagon with his bare tongue!

278
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,601
♪ This is the song that
you hear at the circus ♪

279
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:53,745
♪ Sung by a guy that you
see at the circus ♪

280
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:55,809

281
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:56,958
♪ Do-do-do...

00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:57,959
D'oh!

00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:01,643
Or gape in terror at Almighty
God's whoopsy-daisies...

284
00:15:01,663 --> 00:15:02,997
the Freaks!

285
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,695
(crowd exclaims)

286
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:07,375
The Human Donkey.

287
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:08,910
Hee-haw!

288
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:10,956
The Terrifying Callback.

289
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,460
- ♪ Mock
- Yeah.

290
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:14,138
- ♪ Ing...
- Yeah.

291
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,291
Creatures from another galaxy!

292
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,938
Actually, it's more
of a globular cluster.

293
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,085
Not the dark, not the dark!

294
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:22,953
Ah!

295
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:26,079
And now... I must ask 
that small children leave,

296
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:30,106
good women avert their eyes, and men
take a stiff slug of circus whiskey.

297
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:34,127
Behold, the most hideous
creature of all.

298
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,996
- How ya doin'?
- (audience screams)

299
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,328
So, uh, anyone here
from New Jersey?

300
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:40,783
I'm goin' there next week.

301
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,379
(screams)

302
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:44,615
(humming)

303
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,269
(humming continues)

304
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:49,230
Whoa!

305
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:51,266
(grunting)

306
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,735
(humming)

307
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:55,786
- Hey, torso! What's with the cookies?
- Huh?

308
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:58,202
Even the human snail
would've been done by now.

309
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:03,127
I am so sick and tired of people assuming
that the human snail is, in some way, slow.

310
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:04,636
Good day!

311
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:06,783
(grunts)

312
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,014
All of you! Get back out there with your
flippers flapping, and your stumps a-stumping!

313
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:15,951
Joe and Jane Normal expect some
entertainment for their nickel!

314
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:20,490
Mr. Burnsum! You should treat
these poor people with respect!

315
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:22,460
Marge! Get away
from those freaks.

316
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:25,990
You belong to me!
The dumb, hairless brute.

317
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:29,596
Well, you are the best
this circus has to offer.

318
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,490
(laughing)

319
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:34,218
Taste the strength
of your fiancé.

320
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,619
Ooh!

321
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:39,622
Ooh...

322
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:42,046
With the mighty tongue
God's given you,

323
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:45,676
why can't you speak kindly
of these imperfect angels?

324
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:48,499
Marge, they knew what
they were getting into

325
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,035
when their parents sold
them to the circus.

326
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:55,441
Enough! You will comport yourself with the
dignity expected of a traveling freak show.

327
00:16:55,787 --> 00:16:56,787
(grunts)

328
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:03,429
Excuse me, ma'am, but, uh, I ain't
never seen a normal stand up for us.

329
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:04,447
(sighs)

330
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,142
I, too, am a freak.

331
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,429
One eye is blue,
and the other a pale brown.

332
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,380
I wouldn't want to be you, lady.

333
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,937
Never give up hope, my friends.

334
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:20,434
Of all the kisses I have ever gotten
in my life, that was the first.

335
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,363
Hey, you should
ask her out, Moe.

336
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:24,785
Ah, but she's sweet
on the strong man.

337
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:28,476
You're fine unless Rabbit Ears
hears and tells Big Mouth.

338
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:30,717
(whispering)

339
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:32,677
Wha...?!

340
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:35,508
I ain't got no chance with
the strong man's girl.

341
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:38,792
He makes ten dollars a week plus
all the sawdust he can eat.

342
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:40,631
Well, you've got an emerald ring.

343
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:43,151
My mother's ring.

344
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:43,858
(sobs)

345
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:45,966
She gave it to me
on her deathbed.

346
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:48,084
She also acquired it
on her deathbed.

347
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,965
That was a very busy deathbed.

348
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:53,039
With an emerald that big,
I could buy anything.

349
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:57,130
A jalopy, an icebox, a steamer
trunk full of fedoras!

350
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,662
But how do I get my hands on it?

351
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,922
Oh, I'm an idiot! Of course!

352
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:05,501
I get Marge to marry Moe, 
then I kill Moe, then she gets the ring,

353
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:07,393
then I marry her
and the ring is mine.

354
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:10,527
And the brilliance of my
plan is its simplicity.

355
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:14,024
You're gonna be sorry
you said that.

356
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:17,356
<i>You're</i> gonna be sorry
you said that.

357
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,681
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

358
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,833
I just lost my keys!

359
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,533
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

360
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:29,523
What do you know?
I <i>am</i> gathering moss!

361
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:30,894
(owl hoots)

362
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:33,287
Hey, Marge, you want
to marry Moe?

363
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,616
I'm engaged to you, my love.

364
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:39,649
- The poor, lonely fellow is about to die.
- Really? How?

365
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:41,545
Well, let me worry about how.

366
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:44,516
But you know, you could make
his last day a happy one.

367
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,949
And the ring is just
the icing on the cake.

368
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:51,217
- What ring?
- The ring that'll get me out of this lousy circus

369
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,614
and into a good circus.
Now, let's get you married.

370
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,612
But wouldn't you
be jealous, my love?

371
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:56,275
(laughs)

372
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,343
Dear, I am not the jealous type.

373
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:03,551
And from you, I have learned to feel
compassion for these disgustos.

374
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,002
Aw...

375
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:08,262
(solemnly):
♪ She's a superfreak

376
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:10,649
♪ Superfreak

377
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:13,449
♪ She's superfreaky

378
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,049
♪ Yow.

379
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:16,412
"Yow" indeed.

380
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,830
And so, with the conclusion of
our traditional wedding song,

381
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,755
I now declare you
husband and wife.

382
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,941
Moe, whatever small time together
we have will be wonderful.

383
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:27,939
(laughs)

384
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:29,727
A very small time!

385
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:31,766
Those are strange
things to say,

386
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:35,883
but a wedding is no place to worry about
threats from the bride's former lover.

387
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:38,474
Now, the toast.
To you, Marge.

388
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:40,093
Now you are one of us.

389
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,846
FREAKS (chanting):
One of us! Gooble goo!

390
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:47,571
One of us! Gooble goo!

391
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:49,998
Why is it company parties
always get weird?

392
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:51,545
(cork pops)

393
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,935
God, you are so beautiful
in that peignoir there.

394
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,294
I, uh, better freshen
up a little bit.

395
00:19:58,672 --> 00:19:59,939
(humming)

396
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:01,722
Set it to "massage," Jumbo.

397
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:06,053
(humming)

398
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,035
Hmm? What are you doing?

399
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:13,249
Oh! Trying to kill Moe so
we'll get his emerald!

400
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,882
By the way, I haven't checked,
but emeralds are valuable, right?

401
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:16,607
(gasps)

402
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:18,232
Strong Man!

403
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:23,927
Moe may be ugly on the outside,
but inside, you are the true monster.

404
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:25,842
Leave my trailer forever!

405
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:27,358
<i>You're</i> rejecting <i>me?</i>

406
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,565
But I'm in the best shape
anyone is in the 1930s.

407
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:32,685
I said go!

408
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:34,067
(whimpers)

409
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:39,550
(chanting): 
One of us! Gooble goo!

410
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:41,781
One of us! Gooble goo!

411
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,969
What the hell does
"gooble goo" mean?

412
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,235
(chanting): 
We don't know! Gooble goo!

413
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:48,776
We don't know! Gooble goo!

414
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:51,132
(gasps)

415
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:52,621
You killed Burnsum!

416
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:55,107
Now who is gonna say,
"Step right up"?

417
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:57,608
FREAKS:
Gooble goo! Gooble goo!

418
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,033
Tar and feather him!

419
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:01,212
Tear off his drumsticks!

420
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:03,476
Make him... one of us!

421
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:04,860
FREAKS (chanting):
One of us!

422
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:08,928
- One of us!
- This is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting!

423
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:12,759
And that, kids, is how
I met your mother.

424
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:15,129
