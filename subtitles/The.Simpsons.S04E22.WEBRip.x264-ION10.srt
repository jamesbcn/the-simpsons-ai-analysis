<i>for another patented</i>

176
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,770
<i>Gabbo Crank Call.</i>

177
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,179
<i>Oh, I love these.</i>

178
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,347
I can't believe it.

179
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,185
He stole this bit
from Krusty.

180
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,730
Yeah, well, Krusty stole it
from Steve Allen.

181
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,114
Oh, everything's
stolen nowadays.

182
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,942
Why, the fax machine
is nothing

183
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,737
but a waffle iron
with a phone attached.

184
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,241
<i>It's ringing.</i>

185
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,533
<i>Hello. Is this</i>
<i>Krusty the clown?</i>

186
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,617
{\an8}KRUSTY: <i>Is this the callback</i>
<i>for that porno film?</i>

187
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,082
<i>Look, I was a little nervous</i>
<i>that day, but I'm all man.</i>

188
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,124
<i>I can assure you.</i>

189
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,128
<i>No, I represent</i>
<i>a Japanese camera company.</i>

190
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,211
<i>We'd like to pay you</i>
<i>two million dollars</i>

191
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,666
<i>to do a camera commercial.</i>

192
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,676
KRUSTY:
<i>Whoa! Me rikie vely much.</i>

193
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,889
<i>Oh, I hope</i>
<i>I didn't offend you.</i>

194
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,640
<i>I need this bad.</i>

195
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,061
<i>Bad enough to hit yourself</i>
<i>over the head with the phone?</i>

196
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,850
KRUSTY: <i>Oh, you got it.</i>

197
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,274
<i>(Krusty yells)</i>

198
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,022
<i>Ooh, blood.</i>

199
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,944
<i>(laughter)</i>

200
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,152
KRUSTY:
<i>What the-- Oh.</i>

201
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,744
<i>If this is anyone</i>
<i>but Steve Allen,</i>

202
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,819
<i>you're stealing my bit.</i>

203
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,114
Somebody ought
to ruin Gabbo's career

204
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,697
the way he ruined Krusty's.

205
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,662
Two wrongs don't make
a right, Bart.

206
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,952
-Yes, they do.
-No, they don't.

207
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,285
-Yes, they do.
-No, they don't.

208
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,500
-Yes, they do.
-Dad!

209
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,710
Two wrongs make a right, Lisa.

210
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,670
Ah, Rex Morgan, M.D.

211
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,250
You have the prescription
for the daily blues.

212
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,299
We'll be back
after this commercial

213
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,632
for Gabbo Airlines.

214
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,797
And... cut.

215
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,545
That ought to hold
the little S.O.B.s.

216
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,257
Gabbo, quiet.

217
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,597
Oh, I wouldn't want to
offend the little S.O.B.s.

218
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,813
I wish you'd stop
saying that.

219
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,015
Hmm.

220
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,653
(chuckling)

221
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,650
Hey, boy-o.
What's so funny?

222
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,902
Well, it's--

223
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,153
Nah, you wouldn't
be interested.

224
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,284
It's too low-brow.

225
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,700
No, I'm quite low-brow.

226
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,818
Well, somebody just
wrote a bawdy limerick

227
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,275
on the men's room wall.

228
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,235
This I got to see!

229
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,959
All the kids in Springfield
are S.O.B.s.

230
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,500
Gabbo's kind of language
has no place on or off TV,

231
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,495
and that's my two cents.

232
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,094
That ought to hold
those S.O.B.s.

233
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,335
What the--

234
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,719
(gasps)

235
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,095
Oh, no.

236
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,142
Krusty, are you
making any money?

237
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,267
Nah. That guy's
giving it away for free.

35 years in show business,

242
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,578
and already no one
remembers me, just like...

243
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,042
what's his name

-Yeah.

Know him? He's my worthless
half-brother.

248
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,008
He's a big TV star.

249
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,304
Yeah, on Fox.

250
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,434
Elizabeth Taylor.

00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,976
Hey, Bart, if we get
all these big stars

255
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,645
to appear on
a special with Krusty,

256
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,613
it might get
his career going again.

257
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,026
Here's my address book.

258
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,827
Go get those stars.

259
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,246
It won't be easy,

260
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:50,539
but I'm going to claw
my way back onto TV.

267
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,189
Miss Midler,
I can't believe

268
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,984
you do this
all by yourself.

269
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,107
We're Americans.
We deserve clean highways.

270
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,164
You pigs!

271
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,867
Oh, no.

272
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,332
Bette Midler.

273
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,502
(grunts)

(loud crash)

276
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,631
Now where were we?

277
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,012
We were asking you
to appear

278
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,508
on Krusty's comeback special.

279
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,681
Okay. Tell Krusty
he can count me in.

280
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,021
It's time to
take out the trash.

281
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,185
MAN: I'll get you
for this, Midler!

282
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,241
MAN: <i>And off to your left</i>

283
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,359
<i>is Hugh Hefner's</i>
<i>Shelbyville pad.</i>

284
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,356
A lot of people know
about the grotto

285
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,488
-and the game room.
-Of course.

286
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,035
But few know about the laboratory--
The biosphere.

287
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,209
The alternative energy
research center.

288
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,208
Fascinating.

289
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,513
Desalinization plant?

290
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,761
Yes. The grotto uses
so much water.

291
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,683
The bunnies felt
we should go this way.

292
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,062
{\an8}Smart bunnies, Hef.

293
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,348
{\an8}I can call you Hef,
can't I?

294
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,311
No.

295
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,935
You told our agent this place
holds 30,000 people.

296
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,441
It does. We had 30,000 here
last night.

297
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,534
Now play! The audience
is getting restless.

298
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,199
We want Chili Willy.
We want Chili Willy.

299
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,158
Hey, Red Hot
Chili Peppers,

300
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,371
would you guys
like to appear

301
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,290
on a Krusty
the clown special?

302
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,079
Sure, if you can get us
out of this gig.

303
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,582
No problemo.
Hey Moe, look over there!

304
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,165
What? What am I looking at?

305
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,880
I don't see nothing.

306
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm gonna stop looking soon.

307
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,798
What?
What, is that it?

308
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,550
Hey, Moe,
can I look too?

309
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,342
Sure, but it will cost you.

310
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,635
My wallet's in the car.

311
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,393
He is so stupid.

312
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,681
And now back to the wall.

313
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,187
(humming)

314
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,401
Miss Taylor,
a couple of grade school kids

315
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,071
wanted you to be
on a Krusty special.

316
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,109
I told them to buzz off.

317
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,193
Good.

318
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,738
(humming)

319
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,992
(banging door)

320
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,913
Krusty, we've got
great news.

321
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,162
BOTH: Ahhh!

322
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,541
(groaning)

323
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,371
Krusty, what have you
done to yourself?

324
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,827
I thought
I'd get into shape

325
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,167
so I've been drinking
nothing but milk shakes.

326
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,963
-You mean those diet milkshakes?
-Uh-oh.

327
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,377
Now you can stay with us

328
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,625
until you lose
that weight.

329
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,927
You can sleep
on the sofa.

330
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,390
It folds right out.

331
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,599
(groaning)

332
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,970
(grunting)

333
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,767
Oh, wait.
That was the old sofa.

334
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,347
(cat screeching)

335
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,404
Oh, I'll never get
my aim back.

336
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,606
You got to keep
working on it.

337
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,573
Ahh!

338
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,577
(screaming)

339
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,949
Mmm... delicious.

340
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,292
Oh, why am I bothering?

341
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,674
It's hopeless.

342
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,881
<i>Hi, kids. It's me.</i>
<i>Gabbo.</i>

343
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,802
<i>(laughing)</i>

344
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,590
(grunting)

345
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,350
<i>Pork prices rose in</i>
<i>early trading today.</i>

346
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,770
(grunting)

347
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,482
But you've got to
come back, Mel.

348
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,476
We're a team.

349
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,857
No, Krusty.

350
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,654
You always treated me
rather shabbily.

351
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,567
On our last show, you poured
liquid nitrogen down my pants,

352
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,527
and cracked my buttocks
with a hammer.

353
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,577
Oh, come on.

354
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,910
Do you want
to waste your life

355
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,914
hanging out with a bunch
of dorky teenagers?

356
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,666
Here's your taco, mister.

357
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,668
Whoops.

358
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,669
It fell in the fryer.

359
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,670
I'll get it out.

360
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,631
Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow!

361
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,513
Sorry, Krusty,
I like it here.

362
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,720
Mr. Johanssen treats me
with dignity.

363
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,511
Is this clown
bothering you, Mel?

364
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,934
That's all right,
Mr. Johanssen.

365
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,682
I'll handle it.

366
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,684
Here's your taco, sir.

367
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:15,925
I don't want it.

368
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,346
But this comes out
of my salary.

369
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,444
If I had a girlfriend,
she'd kill me.

370
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,310
MAN: Okay, Krusty, let's
rehearse the balloon bit.

371
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,399
Look, kids!

372
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,534
A horsey!

373
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,991
And what are you making,
Sideshow Luke Perry?

374
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,827
A 19th century carousel.

375
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,254
(yelling)
Upstage me, will you!

376
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,791
Get the hell out!

377
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,504
Look, there must be something
I can do on the show.

378
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,625
Please, for Mom's sake.

379
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,923
Well, maybe
we can find something.

380
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,433
(screaming)

381
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,224
(evil laughing)

382
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,613
I don't like it.

383
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,151
He's got Johnny Carson,
Bette Midler,

384
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,574
and Hugh Hefner.

385
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,742
What do we got?

386
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,530
Ray Jay Johnson.

387
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,083
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

388
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,498
Now boys, the network
has a problem

389
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,959
with some of your lyrics.

390
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,619
Would you mind changing them
for the show?

391
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,247
Forget you, clown.

392
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,793
Hey, our lyrics are
like our children, man.

393
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,247
No way.

394
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,336
Well, okay.
But here where you say,

395
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,762
"What I got you got to get
and put it in you."

396
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,011
How about just, "What I'd like
is I'd like to hug and kiss you."

397
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,014
Wow.
That's much better.

398
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,677
Everyone can enjoy that.
