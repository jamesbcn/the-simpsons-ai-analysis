1
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,660
D'oh!

2
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,232
Is she gonna be okay, Doc?

3
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,833
She's just fine.

4
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,769
And here's the baby.

5
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,405
I know how to hold
one of these.

6
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,273
D'oh!

7
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,288
You're watching
The Learning Network,

8
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:55,556
where minds grow.

9
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,425
Stay tuned for...

10
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:06,167
But first...

11
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,741
The following film,
made in 1982,

12
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,376
was thought to be lost forever.

13
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,611
Actually, it was misplaced
in a box

14
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,114
for the comedy Doctor Detroit.

15
00:01:20,148 --> 00:01:23,284
But its predictions are
more terrifying than ever.

16
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:26,920
Hello, I'm Orson Welles,

17
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,556
director of Citizen Kane...

18
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,823
Boring.

19
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,625
As well as the lower
left-hand square

20
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,060
on Hollywood Squares.

21
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,229
Ooh, right next to Ruth Buzzi.

22
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:38,766
In 1555,
the prophet Nostradamus

23
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,602
foretold a terrifying series
of predictions,

24
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,771
all of which came to pass.

25
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,774
First, his own death.
Second,

26
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,977
large wars in Europe,
similar to the large wars

27
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,279
he observed in Europe.

28
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,981
And the breakup
of Fleetwood Mac.

29
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,984
But Nostradamus's
final quatrain contained

30
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:59,987
one more prediction
yet to come...

31
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,824
that shortly after the
Antichrist becomes president...

32
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,299
This champagne is terrible.

33
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,434
It tastes like dryer sheets.

34
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,504
But what does
said mushroom signify?

35
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:20,007
Nothing less than World War III.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,676
Who'd fall for this malarkey?

37
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,712
Smithers, I'm scared.

38
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,114
Release the comforting hounds.

39
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,451
Oh, excellent.
Now, make them into rugs.

40
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,023
Anyone left alive will surely
find themselves envying...

41
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,125
Who?
Who could we possibly envy?

42
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,000
The dead.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,062
Smithers, the end is nigh,
and we must prepare.

44
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,565
Round up this town's
greatest minds.

45
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,200
Should I order pizza?

46
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,302
One large cheese, double-cut.

47
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,641
Attention, fellow members

48
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,176
of the Springfield chapter
of Mensa.

49
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,078
Mr. Burns has called us here

50
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:02,516
to solve an unknown problem
of global importance.

51
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,486
But first, Tri-Ominoes!

52
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,555
I say we write and solve
our own acrostics.

53
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,557
Yes, after we recite
all the words

54
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,191
in the Declaration of Independence

55
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,860
in alphabetical order.

56
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:16,096
A, A, A, A, A, A.

57
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,000
Abdicated. Abolish. Abolishing.

58
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,569
Absolute. Absolved.

59
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,371
Silence, you thinkertons.

60
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,906
I summoned you here because
the world is about to end.

61
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,075
No, it isn't.
What are you afraid of?

62
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,077
Global warming?

63
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,113
A.I.?
Some sort of plague?

64
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,786
As smarty-pantalones,
I am asking you to help with

65
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,054
the Montgomery Burns
Doomsday Ark.

66
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,757
This space vehicle will lead
humanity's best and brightest

67
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,027
to a better life
under my stern rule.

68
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,962
Oh, gee heavens.

69
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,599
Will there be someone for
your more personal needs?

70
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,201
Concubines.
Many concubines.

71
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,603
I'll work my way in.

72
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,471
I need you to tell me
who is worthy

73
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,807
of surviving
the apocalypse with me.

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,377
I only want the sharpest razors
in this town's Halloween candy.

75
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,414
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Burns,
this is what Mensa does best...

76
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,282
make everyone else feel stupid.

77
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:10,050
The only word in English

78
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,053
with three consecutive
double letters is...

79
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,088
Gooseberry.

80
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,057
No, coffee. Coffee-oo.

81
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,460
- Balloon-an-ing.
- Bookkeeper.

82
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,528
Damn it.

83
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,796
It's simple.
All we need to do is

84
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,998
give everyone in town
an IQ test.

85
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,067
The highest scores
get on the ark...

86
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,102
Mensa members grandfathered in.

87
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,304
Sounds good to me.

88
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:31,739
Grandfathered!

89
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,274
Not so fast. Flavin.

90
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,977
Being intelligent people,
I am quite sure

91
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,178
that you will take this well.

92
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,448
IQs are meaningless.

93
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,582
Heresy!

94
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,484
I have the ultimate test

95
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,520
that measures something
far more significant.

96
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:50,090
Your overall worth as a human.

97
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,425
Impossible.

98
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,260
Intelligence
is the only quotient

99
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,028
that tells you
how important you are.

100
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,899
Ask any of us who did well on
a test we took when we were six.

101
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,805
Well, you may be the brightest,
but you are not the best.

102
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:08,275
Your worthiness as a human being
is best measured, people,

103
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,212
by the Personal Value Quotient.
That's P.V.Q.

104
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,882
Oh! Ow! All right,
enough with the pelting

105
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,984
and the bonking
and the compass in my neck.

106
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,786
Garvik.
In order to defuse

107
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,220
your obvious hostilities,

108
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,990
I will make my presentation
entertaining, all right?

109
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:26,694
With a one, and a two,
and a 3.14159.

110
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:30,197
Forgive me if it seems like
I'm attacking,

111
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,801
but I find the old IQ test
badly lacking.

112
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,804
If you want to find out
just what someone can do,

113
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:41,575
you need to learn
that subject's P.V.Q.

114
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,680
<i>It tests for</i>

115
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:50,217
<i>Sympathy and empathy
and group collaboration</i>

116
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,021
<i>Artistry and neatness
and complex socialization</i>

117
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:57,357
<i>And every single aspect
of a personality</i>

118
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,493
<i>Hey, the P.V.Q.</i>

119
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:03,597
<i>Is A.O.K. with me</i>

120
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,002
<i>It tests for sarcasm
and prudence</i>

121
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,204
<i>Not if you're Isaac Newton</i>

122
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,873
<i>Confidence, ambition</i>

123
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,608
<i>And the teams for whom
you're rootin'</i>

124
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:16,777
<i>So it's all
the little foibles</i>

125
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,345
<i>That can make a person whole</i>

126
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,581
<i>Trust the P.V.Q.</i>

127
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:24,485
<i>The yardstick for the soul</i>

128
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,861
<i>Now, people,
you're all geniuses</i>

129
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,563
- Oh, please...
- My, my, well, thank you.

130
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,465
<i>You can see this is no lark</i>

131
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:40,968
<i>Emotional intelligence
is needed for the ark</i>

132
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,946
<i>You mean earnestness
and ego</i>

133
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,815
<i>And if they make
a mean burrito</i>

134
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,584
<i>And the social grace to know</i>

135
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,819
<i>When not to wear a Speedo</i>

136
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,955
<i>Every trait that integrates
a winning personality</i>

137
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,924
<i>Yes, the P.V.Q.</i>

138
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,461
<i>Is what we'll do
to find out who</i>

139
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,597
<i>Will see us through</i>

140
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,398
<i>Yes, the P.V.Q.</i>

141
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,067
<i>Is A.O.K.</i>

142
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,304
<i>With me...</i>

143
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,407
Oivik!

144
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,743
Anyone have a song in rebuttal?

145
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,412
<i>You got to have hear...</i>

146
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,914
Oh, balderdash.

147
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,181
We're going with
this man's test.

148
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,317
- Oh, wonderful.
- To determine who is worthy

149
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,985
of a seat on my ark.

150
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,087
But, sir, how do we get
everyone in town

151
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,490
to take a test without
telling them what it's about?

152
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,628
Mandatory test.

153
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,429
Mandatory test!

154
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,966
Mandatory for everyone
not ringing a bell.

155
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,970
What's the point
of this test again?

156
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,539
The way I look at it,
the more things

157
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,107
secret corporations know
about us, the better, huh?

158
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,943
I like when drones show up
bringing me things

159
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,511
I needed but didn't know.

160
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,314
Wow, I am out of deodorant.

161
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,550
We all knew.

162
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,785
Remove all stray marks.

163
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,987
Number two pencil only.

164
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,156
And for God's sake, relax!

165
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,825
This question asks about
the price of underwear,

166
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,695
as if I were some
landed aristocrat.

167
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,630
Hey, can I copy off you?

168
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,931
Be my guest.

169
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,072
Day is to night
as early is to...

170
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,541
Late. Booyah!

171
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,645
Booyah!

172
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,049
Booyah!

173
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:41,855
The one test I don't
bring my earmuffs.

174
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,156
The results are in.

175
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,058
The newest
and most accurate measure

176
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,761
of our intelligence
on a scale from one to 500...

177
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,763
500 being best.

178
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,165
- Boring.
- Don't shut it off.

179
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,767
I need my score.

180
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,537
Thank you.

181
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,940
Now we'll run everyone's scores
past the screen really fast,

182
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,875
from best to worst,
trusting that you'll pause

183
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,811
at only your name.

184
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,347
Pause it!

185
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,517
475, my sweet spot. Excellent.

186
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,052
But room to improve.

187
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,591
What?!
I am one below Ralph? Ralph?

188
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,227
Honey, it doesn't mean
Ralph's smarter than you.

189
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,031
It just means he's
a more valuable person.

190
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,466
- Ralph?
- Keep scrolling.

191
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,070
Ooh, 311.

192
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,606
Above average, but not enough
to make people mad.

193
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,943
And, it's the number you call
to complain about potholes.

194
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:40,080
Ooh. H. Simpson, 265.

195
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,715
Exactly the number
of days in a year.

196
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,085
Well, that's good.
Let's change the channel.

197
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,787
But we don't know your score.

198
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,056
Like I said, that's good.

199
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,325
Hmm, not there.
Not there. Not there.

200
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,504
I don't need any test.

201
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,339
I'm street-smart.

202
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:15,949
I refuse to accept that
my little guy has no future.

203
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,451
He can learn how to
put in adding machine tape.

204
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,187
That's how I got through
the Depression,

205
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,823
and letting the FBI know
which bugle boys

206
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,858
were about to turn
boogie-woogie.

207
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,694
We're not giving up on Bart.

208
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,528
And I'm not giving up
on you, Homer.

209
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,630
What, you're still trying?
In what way?

210
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,366
My will is 38 pages
of me yelling at you.

211
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,035
Ooh, I'm in the will.

212
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,008
Charles. Listen to me, Charles.

213
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,876
Not now, Satan.

214
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,978
I'm not Satan, I'm Orson Welles.

215
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,181
Satan would sell wine
before its time.

216
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:52,019
Yes. Now, have you taken
my warning seriously?

217
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,987
Oh, but I did.
I've already started the ark.

218
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,455
Very good. Now I must go.

219
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,825
God commissioned me
to direct a rainbow,

220
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,060
and I've spent half
my budget on indigo.

221
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,963
The only answer
is to play red myself.

222
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,065
Smithers. Speed up production
on the ark.

223
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,700
Put everyone on it.

224
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:09,169
Ply them with all the rum
and salt it takes.

225
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,912
There's no nap
like a scaffold nap.

226
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,750
Hey, what do you think
we're building, anyway?

227
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,985
I'm betting it's a new
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

228
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,854
Maybe this one
will keep somebody out.

229
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,057
How can Ralph score higher
than me?

230
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,259
That's just wrong.

231
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,995
But all my self-esteem comes
from tests.

232
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,866
Should I really be pulling
on this string?

233
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,734
I am not worse than Ralph!

234
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,073
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Ralph.

235
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,074
Hi, Ralph.

236
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,110
I miss the string
through my ears.

237
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:52,746
All right, Lisa.

238
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,082
Watch, do not judge.

239
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,285
What makes him superior?

240
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,391
I'm okay.

241
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,695
You have
reached the Wiggum residence.

242
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,431
If Ralph is stuck in something,
press one.

243
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,134
If something is stuck in Ralph,
press two.

244
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,805
If this is Ralph,
Daddy is not in the phone.

245
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:20,774
Do not open the phone
looking for me.

246
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,142
What are you doing?

247
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,210
The only thing I'm good at.

248
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,311
Nothing.

249
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,745
That tears it.

250
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,447
We're going to see
Professor Frink,

251
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,383
and find out exactly
what happened on that test.

252
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,885
Got a little present
for you, Bart.

253
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,155
It's called
The Bible For The Slow.

254
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,656
He's not going to take it.

255
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,458
Okily-dokily.

256
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,095
Professor Frink, your stupid
test ruined my son's life.

257
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,064
Hey, that test
is like a son to me.

258
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,999
I raised it from a quiz.

259
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,634
I've known my son
since he was born,

260
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,170
and he's not anywhere
near as stupid

261
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,072
as your stupid test says he is.

262
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:56,076
And if you think so,
you're stupid, stupid, stupid!

263
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,845
Wow, Marge.

264
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,080
You really love Bart.

265
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,415
All right, all right,
let me recheck it.

266
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,184
Rechecking, rechecking.

267
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,652
Put-upon sigh.

268
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:06,820
Oivik.

269
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,022
Rechecking... Here we are.

270
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:10,257
Simpson, B.

271
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,094
That's not a B.

272
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,462
Well, yes, it is,
you see, the two...

273
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,964
Oh, my garvik!

274
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,999
There was a mistake.
Well, your son

275
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,134
has above-average intelligence.

276
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,302
You did it, boy.

277
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,670
No, that just looks like a B.

278
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,039
The real unfortunate
is H. Simpson.

279
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,008
I mean, what a clod!

280
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,178
Worst handwriting
and brain in town.

281
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,179
- D'oh!
- Hey!

282
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,680
I'm H. Simpson.

283
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,348
Oh, well, it's very nice
to meet you.

284
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,649
Would you like some water?

285
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:37,684
- Smartwater?
- No.

286
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:43,492
- Homie, aren't you coming?
- Bye-bye.

287
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:46,226
I can't. I'll be a laughing
stock when everyone finds out

288
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,328
I'm the stupidest man in town.

289
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,629
How are they gonna find out?

290
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,031
I just tweeted it.

291
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,201
Marge, you have to get ahead
of these stories.

292
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,707
I'm sorry, sir, you belong here.

293
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,983
Look thou be true.

294
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,384
Do not give dalliance.

295
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,520
Too much of the rein.

296
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:18,325
Why does Oscar skate
in his trash can?

297
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,726
It makes no sense!

298
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,796
I'll cheer up here.

299
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,067
One stupid, please?

300
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,102
Okay, you gave me $40.

301
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,370
Here's two dollars back.

302
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,405
Unless you want
splash insurance.

303
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,174
- How much is that?
- Another ten.

304
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,408
Here's $20.

305
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,310
And two more for you.

306
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,084
Insurance doesn't
cover entryway splashes.

307
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,352
D'oh!

308
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,956
Hey, Homer, we was watching
Jeopardy! But...

309
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,025
tell you what, we'll just talk
about shapes and colors now.

310
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,294
I like blue rectangles.

311
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,096
Rectangles. You know, Homer.

312
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,431
The ones with four sides.

313
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,200
Listen, you.

314
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,070
I've known my shapes
since I was 16!

315
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,073
Put him down, Homer,
and I'll give you a cookie.

316
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,707
That's a coaster.

317
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,242
Dummy's wising up.

318
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,278
I'll take the cookie.

319
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:15,282
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm too depressed for Moe's.

320
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,922
Heya, Homer.

321
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,959
I'm sorry. I know I'm taking up
too much of the bed.

322
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,128
Oh, sweetie.

323
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,264
What the entire world thinks
doesn't affect how I see you.

324
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,066
Well, how do you see me?

325
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,004
The hair and body
of a dashing Friar Tuck.

326
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,508
But what about my brains?

327
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,011
My favorite character
in The Wizard of Oz

328
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,946
was always the Scarecrow.

329
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,481
I knew it. Thanks to that test,

330
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,417
you see me as stupid first
and Homer third.

331
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,851
I mean, second.

332
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:52,952
I know second.

333
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,021
I won't let you give up.

334
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,323
We're going to start
improving you.

335
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,291
Oh, Marge. No one ever did
anything useful

336
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,093
after the age of 39.

337
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,961
George W. Bush sobered up.

338
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,330
And became president.

339
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,098
Too huge mistakes.

340
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,699
Homie, this whole mix-up
happened

341
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,868
because of
your sloppy handwriting.

342
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,704
We'll start with that,
improving your handwriting.

343
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:15,475
Right now, my hand just wants
to crawl in my pocket and cry.

344
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,778
Now this hand is jealous.

345
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,948
I know where this is going.

346
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,785
I do too,
but you say it first.

347
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,287
Snuggling.

348
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,895
What is his secret?
What is his secret?!

349
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,964
I'm going to Dizzyland.

350
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,707
Want to see me do a cartwheel?

351
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,576
- No! No, no, no!
- Good point.

352
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,379
On the other hand, whee!

353
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,083
Don't worry, Lou,
I've seen that in cartoons.

354
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:59,086
Swee'Pea, Mr. Magoo,
they were fine.

355
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,820
What about Sylvester the Cat?

356
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,190
Never be a cat
in a cartoon, Lou.

357
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,191
Never.

358
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,665
The beam must have
a fulcrum I can move to

359
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,866
that would stabilize it.

360
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,103
Think, Lisa, think.

361
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,147
Two for two.

362
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,552
Young man, didn't I tell you
to sit and stay in that house?

363
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,554
I thought you were talking
to the dog.

364
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,089
We don't have a dog.

365
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,957
Then what's been pooping
in my bedroom?

366
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,095
Professor, how on Earth did he
get a higher score than me?

367
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,932
Okay, Lisa, I am going
to give you ten more points

368
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,201
for one of the most important
skills of all...

369
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:51,938
Discovering huge flaws in
my test without telling anyone.

370
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,243
You mean, after all this,
after all I've gone through,

371
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,946
you're just gonna fudge my score
and I should be happy?

372
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,449
Well, after all,
that's how I got into...

373
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,117
Oh, I can't say it.

374
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,585
The lowest of the Ivys.

375
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,120
Oh, God, help me, Cornell!

376
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,321
Cornell! God!

377
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,556
It's okay, you're fine.

378
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,124
Oh, gloyvik.

379
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,959
Okay, Homie, buckle up.

380
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:16,629
Because there's no limit to how
neat your handwriting can get.

381
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,097
Marge, I don't know.

382
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,966
You can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

383
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,904
I'll help you.

384
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,809
<i>My love...</i>

385
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,579
Lisa, turn off
that oldies station!

386
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,147
<i>My darl...</i>

387
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,805
Dearest Marjorie,

388
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,774
what words are adequate
to describe your beauty?

389
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,178
Like, a bowling ball,
fresh out of a polisher.

390
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,680
I've always dreamed

391
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:11,551
Homie would write me
cursive love letters.

392
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:20,393
You are as beautiful
as your sisters are hideous.

393
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,537
Oh, Homie.

394
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,641
I'm married to a writer.

395
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,042
I really am.

396
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,984
Welcome, all of you.

397
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,986
You are the chosen people.

398
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,389
Chosen to be my slaves.

399
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,358
I am no one's slave.

400
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,692
Well, doesn't matter
what you think.

401
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,060
The doors are sealed.

402
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,095
Not this one.

403
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,031
Wait, wait, you haven't heard
about the retirement plan.

404
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,501
There isn't one.

405
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,902
Fine, I don't need them.

406
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,571
I don't need anyone.

407
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:11,344
Why did you have me go back
for your slippers?

408
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,880
How could you turn on me
so quickly?
