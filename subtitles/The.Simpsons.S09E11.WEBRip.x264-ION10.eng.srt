00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,165
(theme music playing)

00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,423
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,342
(bell ringing)

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,098
(tires screeching)

5
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,602
D-oh!

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,772
(screams)

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,396
Ooh!

8
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,619
{\an8}(frustrated grunting)

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,583
{\an8}Stupid heater!

10
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,213
{\an8}Don't make me come in there.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,540
{\an8}Why do you always wait until Christmas Eve

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,835
{\an8}to do your shopping?

13
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,128
{\an8}The crowds are just beastly.

14
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,132
{\an8}You know me, Marge.

15
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,173
{\an8}I crave the hustle and bustle.

16
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,837
{\an8}(grunting)

17
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,965
{\an8}(spitting)

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,263
{\an8}(grunting)

19
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,816
(growling)

20
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,069
(indistinct chatter)

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,610
Homer, look at this mob.

22
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,784
{\an8}The good toys are probably all gone.

23
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,913
{\an8}(chuckling)

24
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,659
{\an8}Oh, Santa's got a little trick
up his sleeve.

25
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,328
{\an8}Attention, shoppers.

26
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,711
{\an8}Register nine is now open
for your shopping convenience.

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,370
Sorry. These are for display only.

28
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,628
This has been recalled.

29
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,249
Ooh! Bart would like this.
We're out of these.

30
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,246
Out? But I just--

31
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,087
Register nine is now closed.

32
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,472
(bell dinging)

33
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,969
(Homer giggles)

34
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,809
Hey, kids,

35
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,812
I made your favorite cookies.

36
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,564
Christmas trees for the girls,

37
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,476
and bloody spearheads for Bart.

38
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,654
Ah, thanks, Mom.

39
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,613
{\an8}(grunting)

40
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,953
(dramatic groan)

41
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,371
{\an8}This year's tree is just perfect.

42
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,619
{\an8}That old aluminum one was so fake.

43
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,621
{\an8}I couldn't agree more.

44
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,623
{\an8}From now on, it's plastic all the way.

45
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,956
{\an8}(boinging)

46
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,581
{\an8}(thumping)

47
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,628
{\an8}Bart, did you hear that?

48
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,001
Could it be?

49
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,801
(screaming)

50
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,802
(yelling)

51
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,846
(laughing)

52
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,022
(screaming)

53
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,394
(door opening)

54
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,187
Come on, kids, let's try the lights.

55
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,323
(buzzing)

56
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,820
It's crap-tacular.

57
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,372
Moo!

58
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:49,668
Hocus-pocus, mucus-pukus.

59
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,462
My powers of deduction tell me

60
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,176
you're getting a handmade sweater--

61
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,428
Possibly... Yellow.

62
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,260
Mom, make him stop!

63
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,055
Bart, put down that yellow sweater.

64
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,809
Nobody's going near their presents

65
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,311
until 7:00 tomorrow morning.

66
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,853
(all groaning)

67
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,606
7:00 a.m.

68
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,688
No earlier.

69
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,232
And you can't set your alarm clocks

70
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,686
'cause I've got them.

71
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,816
For once, we're gonna celebrate
Christmas as a family.

72
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,025
(knocking)

73
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,784
Hello! Anybody home?

74
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,162
(gulping)

75
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,575
Ah!

76
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,207
Twelve glasses of water.

77
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,714
That'll wake me up nice and early

78
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,415
and I'll have a big head start
on opening presents.

79
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,716
Pure genius.

80
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,219
You didn't invent that, Bart.

81
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,641
The Indians used to drink water

82
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,969
to wake up early for their attacks.

83
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,635
(groans) It's always about
the Indians, isn't it, Lis?

84
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,395
Dear Santa, if you bring me
lots of good stuff,

85
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,809
I promise not to do anything bad

86
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,438
between now and when I wake up.

87
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,484
Amen.

88
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,107
Ow! Ooh! I'll kill you!

89
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,987
(grunts)

90
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,276
(water dripping)

91
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,667
(screaming)

92
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,472
(thunder rumbling)

93
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,598
(indistinct chatter)

94
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,898
(crowd cheering)

95
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,904
(chanting): Go, go, go!

96
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,316
We're number one!

97
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,784
Give me a "P!"

98
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,323
(all together) "P!" go! Go! Go!

99
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,368
<i>"P"! "P"! "P"!</i>

100
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,327
(chuckling)

101
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,794
Worked like a charm.

102
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,541
Oh, oh, oh!

103
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,799
(toilet flushing)

104
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,259
Ah!

105
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,179
How sweet it is!

106
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,760
Oh!

107
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,177
(fiendish chortling)

108
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,936
Oh! Aunt Selma.

109
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,614
Always good for a fin. (muah)

110
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,318
Who-ho-ho!

111
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,742
Here we go.

112
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,826
(gasping) The inferno buster 3000!

113
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,160
Ho-ho! I knew Santa wouldn't have time

114
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,866
to check that list twice.

115
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,421
(fire engine bell ringing)

116
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,747
Oh, yeah!

117
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,415
Cool!

118
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,756
(buzzing)

119
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,881
(siren wailing)

120
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,218
Uh-oh.

121
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,524
Eep.

122
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,941
(screaming)

123
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,400
(panting)

124
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,609
Who designed this house?

125
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,748
(gurgling)

126
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,295
Homer? Homer, I think I heard a noise.

127
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,474
(mournful mooing-like snore)

128
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,886
(quiet breathing)

129
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,064
Knock it off!

130
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,402
(groaning)

131
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,452
Snow covers all.

132
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,990
Pure, white snow.

133
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,327
(straining)

134
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,745
(gasp)

135
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,632
(gulping) I got to get back to bed.

136
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,836
(Marge gasping)

137
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,421
What happened?

138
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,336
(whimpering)

139
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,135
Where's Christmas?

140
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,888
Lisa, where's Christmas?

141
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,022
Bart, what were you doing outside?

142
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,774
I don't know how to tell you this,

143
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,113
but I came down a little early

144
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,648
and... um... well...

145
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:28,907
Uh... I saw a burglar
and he was-- he took--

146
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,870
(sobbing) He got all our stuff!

147
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,620
Including the tree.

148
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,083
(blubbering)

149
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,674
We were robbed?

150
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,668
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!

151
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,790
(gasping)

152
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,837
How could somebody...

153
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,209
I know!

154
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,956
(sobbing)

155
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,795
Can... we... skip... church?

156
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,216
(blubbering)

157
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,349
Now, um...

158
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,095
What did this, uh,
Christmas thief look like?

159
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,898
Well, he had a glass eye, a wooden leg...

160
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,073
Um, a big scar on his cheek...

161
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,112
Anything unusual?

162
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,446
Hooks for hands.

163
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,990
Um, oh, he was wearing
a striped convict shirt

164
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,454
and he was carrying a big sack
with a dollar sign on it.

165
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,745
(blowing raspberry) Classic burglar.

166
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,869
Ah, cheer up.

167
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,285
We'll catch this guy.

168
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,833
Uh, chief...

169
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,877
What? You can't rule it out.

170
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,303
(door closes)

171
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,549
Well, there's no easy way to say it, kids.

172
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,342
God hates us.

173
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,675
Hey, since when is Christmas

174
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,350
just about the presents?

175
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,558
Aren't we forgetting
the true meaning of this day--

176
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,720
The birth of Santa?

177
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,677
Bart's absolutely right.

178
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,888
This is the one day

179
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,147
that shouldn't be about material things.

180
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,110
Hey, why don't we walk over to Grampa's

181
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,570
and cheer up the old folks?

182
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,280
That'll make us feel better.

183
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,490
Um...

184
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,989
OK, but they'll have

185
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,371
to be pretty damn miserable
to make me happy.

186
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,369
(Christmas carol playing)

187
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,173
Looks like the Flanders'
are having a nice Christmas.

188
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,880
Oh, yeah? We'll show them.

189
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Come on, kids.

190
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,004
Pretend we got new cross-country skis.

191
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,101
(snow bike honking)

192
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,644
Merry Christmas, Simpson!

193
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,766
(chuckles)

194
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,772
(all laughing)

195
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,991
That's not as fun as it looks.

196
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,278
Nothing could be as fun as that looks.

197
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,072
Hey, look what I got, Bart!

198
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,865
A "tickle me krusty."

199
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,489
(chuckles) <i>Hey, kid, get your</i>
<i>finger out of there.</i>

200
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,827
Ow!

201
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,121
{\an8}MARGE: Homer!

202
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,825
<i>♪ Jingle bell, jingle bell... ♪</i>

203
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,915
Lisa, you promised they'd be miserable.

204
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,291
What the hell's going on?

205
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,587
Oh, the pharmaceutical man come by

206
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,592
and he shot us full of Christmas cheer.

207
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,295
(laughing)

208
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,925
I can't feel nothing below my chin.

209
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,520
(music continues to play)

210
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,483
(squeaking)

211
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,771
Sounds like you're having
a rough Christmas, Homer.

212
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,316
You know what I blame this
on the breakdown of?

213
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,440
Society.

214
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,776
Yeah.

215
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,491
You're right, Moe.

216
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,241
You're always Moe.

217
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,243
Homer, look! Your house is on TV.

218
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,696
You take that back, Barney.

219
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,036
Nah, he's right, Homer.

220
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,831
Stay out of this, old man.

Ah, that's my girl.

00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,892
I love you, Marjorie.

229
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,435

Homer, you won't believe what's happened.

246
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,774
It's a miracle.

247
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,564
Oh, Marge, I don't want to hear anymore

248
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,358

People saw our story on the news

252
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,079
and they've opened their hearts to us.

253
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,999
Arrgh. We just gave what we could.

254
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,039
Does anyone have change for a button?

255
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,173
Wow. This really restores your faith in...

256
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,591
Lisa, do you have to practice
that stupid song now?

257
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,131
Sorry, Daddy.

258
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,594
Hey, heard some no-goodnik
stole your tree.

259
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,005
Well, we got a 30-footer

260
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,933
so you can have the top of ours.

261
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,721
Thanks, Ted.

262
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,643
Bart, this is Patches.

263
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,807
And what was your name?

264
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,984
Poor Violet.

265
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,402
Hmm. I don't like where this is going.

266

Your story made everyone
at the orphanage so sad.

We want you to have
this dollar we were saving.

Please, I don't deserve this.

Hey, listen up, everybody.

270
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,656
The Simpsons are
the best friends I ever had.

271
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,456
So I'm giving them
the tip jar from the bar.

273
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,673
My goodness.

274
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,215
There is over $15,000 here.

00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,799
15,000 missoulians!

What are you going to do with
all that Kablingie?

278
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,888
Well, if you mean the money,

279
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,983
I suppose we'll just replace the items

00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,058

281
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,983
Boring! Spend it on something fun.

Go wild. Ha!

283
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,361
Right, Seymour?

284
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,979
(woodenly): Yes. Something wild.

285
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,145
Yeah, enjoy, huh?

286
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,283
Get something fun.

287
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,609
Something stupid.

288
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,364
You only live once.

289
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,696
Hey, speak for yourself.

290
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,371
Marge, kids,

291
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,409
let's go buy some happiness.

293
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,423
God bless you, Bart Simpson.

294
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,039
I'd kiss you, but doctor says I'm sick.

295
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,207
(coughs)

296
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,217
Is this car $15,000?

297
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,763
Yeah, it is now.

298
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,346
And because of your loss, folks

299
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,731
I'll throw in the undercoating for...

300
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,139
200... No...

301
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,147
490 bucks.

302
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,559
What a deal.

303
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,187
I'd be a sucker not to get it.

304
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,693
I don't know about this, Dad.

305
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,525
Shouldn't we give the money
to charity or some-- Ow!

306
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,781
Oh, I'm sorry.

307
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,032
I jabbed you with my pen.

308
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,163
-Ow! You're still doing it.
-Yeah, I know.

Out of my way, snow-poke.

Slow down, Homer.

318

Don't worry, Honey.

319

00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,812
Oopsie.

321
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,903
Tap the brakes. Tap the brakes.

322
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,769
-Turn into the skid.
-No, away from the skid.

323
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,396
-Hit the brakes! Stop!
-(all speaking together)

324
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,782
To the left!

325
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,189
Shut up! One at a time!

326
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,702
-Lisa?
-Bail out!

327
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,528
(all scream)

328
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,579
Huh. That was close.

329
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,583
(cracking)

330
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,589
Oh, I knew this would happen.

331
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,683
Well, at least the burglar's
having a Merry Christmas.

332
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,810
MARGE: Bart, you're up early.

333
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,812
I couldn't sleep.

334
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,103
What's wrong?

335
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,855
(sighs)

336
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,149
There was no burglar.

337
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,612
What does he mean, no burglar?

338
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,863
I accidentally burned up the tree,

339
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,952
and the presents.

340
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,368
I'm really sorry.

341
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,199
Why, you little...

342
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,156
HOMER: Lisa, no!

343
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,576
Your hands are too weak.

344
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,754
Bart, you little...

345
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,882
(gasping)

346
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,879
-I'm going to kill you!
-Stop that!

347
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,421
-I'm killing him first.
-Stop that!

348
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,054
(all shouting)

349
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,221
(doorbell rings)

350
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,353
Kent Brockman here for a follow-up

351
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,810
with Springfield's favorite
hard luck family,

352
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,851
The Simpsons.

353
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,774
Folks, any words for the Christmas thief

354
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,812
if he's watching?

355
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,765
Uh... Yes, Kent.

356
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,856
(stiffly): Uh, hello, jerk.

357
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,032
We may never find you

358
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,899
and we should probably all stop looking.

359
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,857
But one thing's for sure--

360
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,908
You do exist.

361
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,281
Strong words.

362
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,038
Strong, bewildering words.

363
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,710
Also, we want to thank the whole town

364
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,079
for their generosity.

365
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,785
(growling)

366
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,915
Hey, look!

367
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,801
It's little Bart's fire truck.

368
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,759
(Brockman gasps)

369
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,470
Little Lisa's sweater.

370
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,760
Little Homer's sausage.

371
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,143
What in the name of holy hell
is going on here?

372
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,601
Oh, it's true.

373
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,931
We weren't robbed.

374
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,765
That part we made up,
but the rest is true.

375
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,021
(sobbing)

376
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,773
Wait. He's just covering for me.

377
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,605
I destroyed the presents,
then I buried the evidence

378
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,902
and I acted alone.

379
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,315
So the family never knew
about any of this?

380
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,664
Well the boy told us

381
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,529
but that was after we filed
aphony police report.

382
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,947
And after we spent all
the townspeople's money.

383
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,536
So you can see why my husband
had to lie to you a moment ago.

384
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,963
So this was all a scam.

385
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,803
And on Christmas.

386
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,378
Yeah. Jesus must be spinning in his grave.

387
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,514
We gave them our vitamin money.

388
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,763
(coughs)

389
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,965
Hey, hey, shoo, you lousy freeloaders!

390
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,715
Come back when you get some parents!

391
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,347
In my long career,

392
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,104
I've seen some pretty shabby things,

393
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,646
but this putrid fraud outstinks them all.

394
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,743
MAN: And... cut.

395
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,360
(scoffs) I just want
to thank you folks so much.

396
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,066
This has turned out to be
a great, great story for me.

397
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,958
(sighs) I think they're
running out of tomatoes.

398
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,254
Yeah, but they still got

399
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,296
plenty of pumpkins.

400
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,629
(groans) Oh, Homie, I'm so ashamed.

401
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,256
Relax, Marge.

402
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,762
This will all blow over.

403
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,304
(window shatters)

404
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,807
(reeling)

405
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,018
(window shatters)

406
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,729
(groaning)

407
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,858
Oh, no. Look at the line.

408
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,363
Oh, there they are.

409
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,195
Ah, it's the swindlers.

410
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,410
The Simpsons.

411
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,280
Ah, them stinkir liars.

412
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,076
Well, there goes Christmas dinner.

413
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, head of the line.

414
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,289
A family could get
used to being shunned, huh?

415
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,923
Hey, look, sean.

416
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,924
It's that family everybody hates.

417
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,416
Whatever.

418
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,804
Um, Miss Hoover...

419
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,807
Miss Hoover.

420
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,968
Forget it, Lisa.

421
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,966
I'm not teaching you anything

422
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,597
until I get my money back.

423
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,693
Now turn your desk around
and stop learning.

424
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,483
Ohh...

425
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,574
All the way.

426
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,242
(grunts)

427
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,648
Hi, liar.

428
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,162
Run for your lives, everyone!
This is not a drill!

429
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,792
-(snickers)
-Oh, right. Yeah.

430
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,709
Then while we're gone, you take our snacks

431
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,249
just like you took our money.

432
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,542
You tell him, Lenny.

433
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,916
MARGE: "You'll all get yours in hell

434
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,133
you lying, thieving..."

435
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,086
(clears throat) "blanking blankers.

436
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,335
Sincerely, Moe."

437
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,426
Oh, great.

438
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,181
Now we have to send him a card.

439
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,603
I know you're used to getting
hate mail, but I'm not.

440
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,233
There's only one way out.

441
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,059
We've got to give this greedy town

442
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,015
its money back.

443
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,824
But we don't have $15,000.

444
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,688
Unless...

445
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,355
("Final Jeopardy" theme playing)

446
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,036
Aren't we forgetting something, Marge?

447
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,121
You were down $5,200 hundred dollars.

448
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,286
But Mr. Trebek--

449
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,174
I asked you before the
game if you knew the rules

450
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,711
and you said you did.

451
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,134
Judges.

452
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,882
Run, Mom!

453
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,758
She ain't getting the home version.

454
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,805
(moaning) Guess we better get used

455
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,232
to being pariahs.

456
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,770
There's no shame in being a pariah.

457
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,860
Oh, no. There's that angry mob again.

458
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,113
(indistinct chatter)

459
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,525
Hey look who's here everbody.

460
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,704
(all) Oh, hi.

461
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,831
(all) Hi.

462
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,830
Oh my! They've forgiven us.

463
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,793
It's a miracle.

464
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,593
You know deep down people are pretty...

465
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,918
Hey. Wait a minute.

466
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,920
They're taking our stuff!

467
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,013
Good Lord!

468
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,431
(humming)

469
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,311
Hot, hot, hot.

470
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,604
Hmm. Hmm.

471
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,767
If your heading for the medicine cabinet

472
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,105
Iv'e already been there.

473
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,855
Huh!

474
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,315
What the hell's going on?

475
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,534
Well, we hated being mad at you, Homer,

476
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,575
so we've decided to make things right.

477
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,869
Consider your debt repaid neighbor.

478
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,873
And then some.

479
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,747
(door slams)

480
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,878
Look, I know this has been a
stressful holiday,

481
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,887
but in a way having nothing

482
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,510
reminds us how lucky we really are.

483
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,597
What?

484
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,022
We still have each other

485
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,890
and isn't that the best gift of all.

486
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,058
But we would have had each other anyway.

487
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,646
Yeah, plus lots of other stuff.

488
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,071
Maybe so.

489
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,109
But there is one thing they forgot

490
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,283
to take away from us.

491
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,449
This washcloth.

492
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,871
Hey! That's my washcloth.

493
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,909
The hell it is!

494
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,992
Hey, give me that!

495
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,581
Give me that wash cloth.

496
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,212
Stop this this madness!

497
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,289
It's just a wash cloth.

498
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,044
Besides it's mine. Yoink.

499
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,996
HOMER: Hey, she's getting
away the washcloth.

500
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,586
