of you saying that

172
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,572
I put beans in your bindle!

173
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,034
It just makes me so--"

174
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,744
(as Jake): "Do you ever shut up?"

175
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,535
(as Tillie): "Kiss me, you fool!"

176
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,498
(kissing noises)

177
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,461
{\an8}Uh, could we hear another tall tale?

178
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,253
-In a sec.
-(kissing noises continue)

179
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,340
All righty.

180
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,054
Here's a story just for you, little girl.

181
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:40,255
It's the tale of Johnny--
No. Connie Appleseed.

182
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,928
Oh. (chuckles)

183
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,598
HOBO: <i>Back around 1840...</i>

Whoopsie. (chuckles)

192
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,576
Dad, you just killed
a poor defenseless buffalo.

193
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,825
A poor, delicious buffalo.

194
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,627
He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.

195
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,128
(buffalo moos, thuds)

196
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,723
-Why'd you kill another one?
-Dessert.

-Ow!

198
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,887
Hey, I found a bullet.

-(buffalo moos, thuds)
-(chuckling)

200
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,363
-Man, buffalo are easy to kill.
-LISA: People,

201
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,689
if you don't stop this slaughter,
you'll wipe out the buffalo.

202
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,316
Wipe out an entire species?
Why, that's impossible.

203
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,405
(all laughing)

204
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,411
(groaning)

205
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,174
Why is it we have ladders
that can put a man on the roof

206
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,843
but we can't find a renewable

207
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,091
-source of food?
-(vulture screams)

208
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,262
Think, Connie. Think.

209
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,011
-(man's voice) Connie.
-Wha--

210
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,724
Connie.

211
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:06,725
(gasps) That tree! It seems to be
calling to me.

212
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,191
Of course! Apples!

213
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,567
No, Connie, over here!

214
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,242
Help me! (gurgling)

215
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,161
Mom, Dad, look what I found!

216
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,451
(gasps) Oh, boy! Buffalo testicles!

217
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,288
-Mmm!
-No, Dad, they're apples.

218
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,423
(groans) Yuck! Yuck!

219
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,921
Well, that's it. I don't want anything
to do with this wagon train of death.

220
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,966
Either switch to apples,
or go on without me.

221
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,300
-Hmm!
-(whip cracks)

222
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,854
You'll be sorry!

223
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,057
-(buffalo moos)
-(thud)

224
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,194
Oh!

225
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,227
HOBO: <i>So Connie roamed the prairie alone,</i>

226
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,857

227
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,624
<i>She even changed</i>

228

(yawning)

231
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,889
I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge,

232
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,298
how about whipping up
some buffalo sausage,

233
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,767
huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed
buffal-O.J.?

234
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,689
The buffalo are gone.
I think you shot them all.

235
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,650
(birds screeching)

236
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,650
{\an8}Oh! Connie was right!

237
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,573
We wiped out the entire species!

238
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,493
What have I done? What have I done?

239
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,493
{\an8}Calm down, Pa. There's two left.

240
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,372
-(gunfire)
-(both moo)

241
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,957
What have I done? What have I done?

HOBO: <i>With the buffalo gone,</i>

243
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,011

(whimpering)

245
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,087
You're the fattest, Bufflekill.

246
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,176
OK, everybody, dig in!

247
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,182
-(all moaning)
-(screaming)

248
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,175
Stop! I've got apples!

249
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,267
Delicious, nutritious apples.

250
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,272
And there's enough for everyone.

251
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,942
Sweet!

252
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,531
It's like a hootenanny in my mouth!

253
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,623
-We're saved!
-It's a miracle!

254
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,659
-Hooray for Connie Bufflekill!
-What?

255
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,370
So now we're not eating Homer?

256
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,746
And thanks to that little girl...

257
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,213
today you can find apples
in everything that's good.

258
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,415
Apple wine, apple whiskey,

259
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,085
apple schnapps, apple martinis...

260
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,764
uh, Snapple with vodka in it...

261
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,854
apple nail polish remover...

262
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,809
Don't forget applesauce.

263
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,270
Yeah. I suppose you could
grind some pills into it.

264
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,352
Aw.

265
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,281
Whoa, look out there, folks.

266
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,950
-That's the mighty Mississippi.
-Big deal.

267
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,370
Reminds me of a tall tale
about two scalawags

268
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,120
rafting down the Big Muddy...

269
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,712
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.

270
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,998
That's not a tall tale.
It's a book by Mark Twain.

271
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,343
Look, let's just do this thing.

272
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,675
Whitewashing sucks, Tom.
It powerful sucks.

273
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
-(humming)
-Morning, friend.

274
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,682
Want your turn at whitewashin'?
It's powerful fun.

275
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,935
Why, you ain't
fooling me again, Tom Sawyer.

276
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,098
-If I may.
-(grunts)

277
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,227
Now get to work!

278
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,610
(chuckles) I still got it.

279
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,074
(humming)

280
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,865
Now, Huckleberry Finn,
you get down from there.

281
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,160
A body could break his neck.

282
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,453
I ain't afeard of that.

283
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,956
-I'd just get a new neck, off'n a cat.
-(gasps)

284
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,250
{\an8}-Huck!
-(groaning)

285
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,884
Oh, Huck, you gave your bones
an awful rattling.

286
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,973
Yeah. But I'm feeling better right now.

287
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,299
{\an8}-HOMER: Aha!
-Papa!

288
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,558
Hold my daughter's hand, will ya?

289
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,980
I was gonna let go by-and-by.

290
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,270
Well, I guess there's no harm done

291
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,824
as long as it was going to be by-and-by.

292
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,228
But just to play it safe...

293
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,486
We're gathered here today
to force this man

294
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,369
Huckleberry Finn, into holy matrimony.

295
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,118
How romantic.

296
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,701
This reminds me of our shotgun wedding.

297
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,002
Grandpa, we've been married for years.

298
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,871
When are you gonna put down that gun?

299
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,998
Well, I reckon you're right.

300
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,048
Hang it all!

301
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,879
Do you, Huck, take Becky as your wife?

302
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,296
-(squealing)
-Whoa!

303
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,307
Hey, they done switched
the groom with a pig!

304
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,559
-No wonder he was pooping so much.
-NELSON: Ha-ha!

305
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,022
(snorting, laughing)

306
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,483
Come on! Let's get those polecats!

307
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,864
{\an8}-(all clamoring)
-(squeals)

308
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,451
Oh, d'oh!

309
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,160
Now, we'll never catch 'em!

310
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,584
I reckon we're safe now.
There's the state line.

311
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,588
Uh-oh! Rapids!

312
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,550

319
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,453
I'm considerable hungry.
We got any food left?

320
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,492
Hmm. Looks like we're out of corn pone,

321
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,366
fatback, hardtack, fat pone, "corntack."

322
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,124
-Any "tackback"?
-"Tackback"?

323
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,956
-I mean "backtack."
-Plumb out.

324
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,554
One jug of whiskey, three plugs of tobacky

325
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,801
and some extra-strength opium.

326
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,973
-That will be two cents, boys.
-(gasps) Two cents?

327
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,523
Hey, if you think my prices are high,
go across the street.

328
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,854
-Thank you. Come again.
-(groans)

329
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,896
He put the lard pone

00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,703
(both screaming)

344
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,241
Well, I see President Fillmore
is in the news again.

345
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,906
-Glug, glug, glug.
-(all laughing)

346
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,499
What'll it be, boys?

347
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,883
-Just three X's for me.
-Give me five.

348
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,635
This ain't no five-X whiskey.
I can still see.

349
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,640
That barkeep's a no-good cheat!

350
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,932
ALL: Cheat?

351
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,022
Eh. All right. We've all got derringers.

352
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,567
Now let's just put 'em away.
Nobody here is a cheat.

353
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,702
ALL: Cheat?

354
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,361
Aw, geez.

355
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,500
Man, those derringer bullets are weak.

356
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,869
Powerful weak.

357
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,001
Light out, and stay lit out!

358
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,713
(both yelling)

359
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,045
(gurgling) Aw, catfish.

360
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,599
{\an8}Let us pray for the souls
of these dearly departed young men,

361
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:26,058
Huckleberry Finn and Thomas Sawyer.

362
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:33,189
Now for the traditional
lowering of the bodies into the coffins.

363
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,033
(organ playing)

364
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,409
And that was Tom and Huck's
last adventure.

365
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,541
I liked that story, 'cause I was a judge.

366
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,251
MAN: Delaware!

367
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,369
Well, this is our stop.

368
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,786
Would you like to come
sightseeing with us?

369
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,915
We're going to visit the place
where J.C. Penney

370
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,802
sends their damaged merchandise.

371
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,509
No, thanks. I'm gonna keep on
ridin' the rails

372
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,471
swappin' stories for sponge baths.

373
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,851
{\an8}(all laughing)

374
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,431
(Hobo clears throat)

375
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,104
I believe I told three stories.

376
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,055
Oh! I'll meet you in Wilmington.

377
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,396
(train horn blares)

378
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,654
Close the door.

379
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,371
HOMER: Raise your arm. OK, the other one.

380
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,578
HOBO: You know, I do, uh,
400 sit-ups a day.

381
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,450
HOMER: Oh, it shows.
I was gonna say something...

382
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,577
but I thought it might sound,
you know, weird.

383
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,674
HOBO: Oh, not at all.

384
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,668
I like when people
say nice things about my body.

385
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,961
HOMER: And it's important
to feel good about yourself.

386
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,165
OK, spread your toes.

387
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,466
Oh!

388
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,679
You know how much glass is in here?

389
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,717
(theme music playing)

390
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,259
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

391
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,514
HOMER: Oh, boy! Buffalo testicles!
(chomping sound)
