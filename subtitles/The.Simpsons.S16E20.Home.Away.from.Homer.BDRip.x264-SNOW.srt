346
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,250
Relax, dumbass.

347
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,245
By the way.
I borrowed some gas
from your car, you dumb-ass!

348
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,085
But I siphoned that
gas from Flanders.

349
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,605
Flanders.

350
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,763
What are you doing,
reminiscing?
Like a woman?

351
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,401
Like a woman
who's made the biggest
mistake of her life!

352
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,960
(WAILS)

353
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,370
(MUSIC PLAYING)

354
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,681
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(GRUNTS)

355
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,765
(GASPS) Homer?
What are you
doing here?

356
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,242
I was just driving around
the Mid-Atlantic states,

357
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,369
ringing doorbells
at random.
And I just...

358
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,721
(WAILING)

359
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,167
Who am I fooling
with my awesome lies?

360
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,050
I want you to come
back to Springfield!

361
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,930
Why? So you can make me
a laughingstock again?

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,890
No. I want
to make you
a respecting-stock.

363
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,570
I don't know
if you've noticed.

364
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,291
But I borrowed
a lot of your stuff
over the years.

365
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,169
Well, that is true.
In fact...

366
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,526
Shut up, Flanders.

367
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,570
But some things
I could never
take from you.

368
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,564
Your kindness,
your gentle spirit,

369
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,645
and your infinite patience
with a big, dumb jerk like me.

370
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,200
Ned, I don't deserve you
as a neighbor,

371
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,887
but will you forgive
a young, handsome fool
and come home?

372
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,485
Homer, that's really touching.

373
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,847
But my boys and I
are trying to make
a new start,

374
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,406
and people here
are a little bit
more my cup of...

375
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,481
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

376
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,600
Are there letters
to pick up or no letters
to pick up?

377
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,842
I can't tell and I'm
looking right at it.

378
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,403
Ooh, that tears it!

379
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,403
Boys, put on
your goody two-shoes.

380
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,926
We're moving
back to Springfield!

381
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,525
But l have
a girlfriend.

382
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,011
Now you've got
a pen-pal.

383
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,081
Yay!

384
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,521
So you see,
Mr. Roberts,

385
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,523
I really would
like my house back.

386
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,729
Really? Well,
that's too bad
because I'm not leaving.

387
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,404
See, I like this place,

388
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,642
and I've already
got fatso, here,
broken in.

389
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,808
Ain't that right,
fatso? Huh?
(GRUNTS)

390
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,602
Yeah. lam a little pudgy.

391
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,921
You got me. Yeah.

392
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,726
Now, Coach,
I've tried to be
Christian and respectful.

393
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,007
But l guess
I'm just gonna
have to point out

394
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,162
your $200,000
check bounced.

395
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,402
Legally, I still
own this house.

396
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,403
Yeah? Tell it
to the Marines!

397
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,568
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(GROANS)

398
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,282
Okay! Okay, I give. Ow!

399
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,761
(GRUNTS)
Ow!

400
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,242
Why did you do that?
I was begging for mercy!

401
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,209
I saw my advantage
and I took it.

402
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,169
That's what heroes do.

403
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,681
Okay, Ned. Get ready
for your welcome
home surprise!

404
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,801
(GASPS)

405
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,523
Homer, did you steal
the organ from
the church?

406
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,409
Maybe. We don't know
that for sure.

407
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,845
Well, you gotta
take it back.

408
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,126
After the party.

409
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
(PLAYING)

410
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,690
It sure is great
to look down my nose
at everybody again.

411
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,250
Mind if I waggle
my finger a little bit?

412
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,890
Go nuts.

413
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,803
Flanders? Okay, that's it.

414
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,484
It's really irritating!

415
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,846
