D'oh.
(screams)

12
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,988
(Homer screams)

13
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,803
{\an8}Now, remember,
we have to leave nature

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,340
{\an8}just the way we found it.

15
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,763
{\an8}Everything we pack in, we pack out.

16
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,592
{\an8}What if I have to do my business?

17
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,007
{\an8}Use this plastic bag.

18
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,136
{\an8}Oh, how come bears
can crap in the woods

19
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,143
{\an8}and I can't?

20
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,601
{\an8}(grunts)

21
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:48,112
{\an8}Ah, we're so lucky to have
this untouched piece of paradise

22
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,571
{\an8}so close to Springfield.

23
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,648
{\an8}-(buzzing)
-(gasps) Bees!

24
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,487
{\an8}They sound angry and Africanized.

25
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,954
{\an8}OK, nobody panic.

26
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,543
{\an8}There's plenty of spray for me.

27
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,633
{\an8}-(tires squealing)
-That doesn't sound like bees.

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,165
{\an8}Oh, my god!

29
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,705
{\an8}It's a racetrack.

30
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,144
{\an8}(gasps)
The bird sanctuary.

31
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,388
{\an8}They ruined it.

32
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,009
{\an8}HOMER: No, they didn't.

33
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,266
{\an8}They just surrounded it
with something wonderful.

34
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,769
{\an8}Like a raisin covered in chocolate.

35
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,062
{\an8}Or a monkey in a cowboy suit.

36
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,861
{\an8}-HOMER: Hmm.
-LISA: Whoa!

37
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,437
{\an8}-HOMER: Hmm.
-LISA: Whoa!

38
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,067
{\an8}See?
Animals can get used to anything.

39
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,987
{\an8}(grunting)

40
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,702
{\an8}(squawks)
Start your engines!

41
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,867
{\an8}Show us your boobs.
Show us your boobs.

42
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,206
{\an8}Oh, you better do
what he says, Marge.

43
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,592
BART: Cool!

44
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,592
{\an8}Way to adapt, little guy.

45
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,303
Why do jerks think everyone wants

46
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,136
to see their stupid name?

47
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,774
(screams)

48
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,111
(grunts)

49
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,690
Sorry to break up your picnic, folks.

50
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,074
I'm two-time
fast car champ Clay Babcock.

51
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,492
You're on fire!

52
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,780
Yeah, I have won a lot of races,

53
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,623
but it's all thanks to my crew, really.

54
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,488
Eh! Ah! Hoo! There it is.

55
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,285
Mr. Babcock, can I take a ride
in you car?

56
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,998
Well, my "A" car was just incinerated,

57
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,658
but, uh, you could ride in my "B" car.

58
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,827
{\an8}I don't see why not.

59
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,090
Bart, these are the time trials

60
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,170
that determine the pole position.

61
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,965
Shouldn't you be keeping
your hands on the wheel?

62
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,339
Oh, sure, if you want to drive

63
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,215
the traditional way.

64
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,216
-Whoa!
-Sorry.

65
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,808
Boy, these cars are surprisingly roomy.

66
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,430
Yeah, we like to bring
our families along

67
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,726
on the longer races.

68
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,939
If I get tired, I let my wife drive.

69
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,980
She's good.

70
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,153
Get your feet off the upholstery.

71
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,364
(tires screeching)

72
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,652
Folks, I got some spare tickets

73
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,275
if you'd like
to stick around for the race.

74
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,322
{\an8}That's very sweet,

75
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,494
{\an8}but we have a full day
of hiking planned.

76
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,873
We can hike anytime.

77
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,450
This is our chance to see cars driving.

78
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,405
-LISA: Oh.
-HOMER: Hmm.

79
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,541
Hi-diddly-ho,
pedal-to-the-metal-o-philes.

80
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,335
Flanders? Since when do you like
anything cool?

81
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,839
Well, I don't care for the speed,

82
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,261
but I can't get enough
of that safety gear.

83
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,300
Helmets, roll bars, caution flags.

84
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,844
I like the fresh air

85
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,177
and looking at
the poor people in the infield.

86
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,683
(cheering)

87
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,773
Dang, Cletus!

88
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,640
Why did you have to park
by my parents?

89
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,727
Now, honey, they's my parents, too.

90
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,113
ANNOUNCER: <i>Gentlemen,</i>

91
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,946

00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:39,858
(engines start)

93
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,356
Daddy, can we move closer?

94
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,117
Abso-not-ly, hot-roddy.

95
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,739
We're up here out of range
of the crashes

96
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,076
and the drivers cussing.

97
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,830
-Move your damn butt!
-Bite me!

98
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,495
(all gasping)

99
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,254
(disappointed groaning)

100
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,588
(all gasping)

101
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,379
(disappointed groaning)

102
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,636
Come on! Somebody crash!

103
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,469
Be patient, son.

104
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,854
A watched car never crashes.

105
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,101
-(crash)
-Oh, I missed one!

106
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,556
MAN: Let's go! Let's go!

107
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,110
The dice! The dice! The dice!

108
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,071
Eight seconds. Great job, boys.

109
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,866
Let's go! New tires! Come on! Come on!

110
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,124
We're going as fast as we can.

111
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,166
Hey, who are you?

112
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,079
{\an8}Oh, how rude of me.
My name is...

113
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,626
My bad.

114
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,466
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now,</i>

115
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,679
<i>here's something for the guys.</i>

116
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:44,973
Finally.

117
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,603
ANNOUNCER: <i>Let's hear it</i>

118
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,429
<i>for Fan-demonium!</i>

119
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,306
Hey, racing fans,

120
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,153
who wants a free t-shirt?

121
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,396
-(all yelling)
-Me, me.

122
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,572
(speaking in Spanish)

123
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,979
I do, I do.

124
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,485
Wait. No, I don't.

125
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,697
Hmm. A Ford
urinating on a Chevrolet.

126
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,749
Don't you usually laugh at everything?

127
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,380
Yes. Yes, I do.

128
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,668
Come on! Right here!

129
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,291
-Ow!
-(all gasping)

130
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,798
I'm OK, folks.

131
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,259
(disappointed groaning)

132
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,419
I need a shirt!

133
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,587
Give me a shirt!

134
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,304
Mommy has bosoms like that.

135
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,795
Yeah, I wish.

136
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,176
Neddy, I've had about all I can take

137
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,773
of Homer Simpson's torso.

138
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,928
I'll get some hot dogs.

139
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,176
No foot-longs.

140
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,187
I know.

141
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,518
-They make you uncomfortable.
-(Homer humming)

142
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,147
Well, I guess no one else

143
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,732
wants a t-shirt.

144
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,857
That's a damn lie and you know it!

145
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,074
Give me a shirt!

146
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,993
You heard him, girls.

147
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,743
Hey, t-shirt, t-shirt, t-shirt!

148
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,081
Fire!

149
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,077
Ooh! A bobby pin.

150
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,213
(screaming)

151
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,384
(gasping) Maude?

152
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,474
(speaking indistinctly)

153
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,344
Oh, my lord! She's dead.

154
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,388
(gasps) Ah...

155
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,599
It's hard to believe

156
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,895
we're never going
to see Maude again.

157
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,979
And poor Ned didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

158
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,435
Well, from now on, I'm never going
to let you leave the room

159
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,396
without telling you
how much I love you

160
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,486
and how truly special--

161
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,242
This is really eating up a lot time.

162
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,533
Maybe just a pat on the butt.

163
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,027
Yeah, that works.

164
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,658
Now, Homie, you know
Ned and the boys need us

165
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,366
and you know what that means.

166
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,497
I know.

167
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,213
No more being a jerk.

168
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,253
That's right.

169
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,342
(sniffs)

170
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,727
In many ways, Maude Flanders
was a supporting player

171
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,271
in our lives.

172
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,194
She didn't grab our attention

173
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,363
with memorable catch phrases,

174
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,442
or comical accents.

175
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,857
-Aye.
-Arrgh.

176
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,655
(speaking gibberish)

177
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,330
But whether
you noticed her or not,

178
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,159
Maude was always there.

179
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,035
And we thought she always would be.

180
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,543
My friends, life is about change.

181
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,916
Just yesterday,
Apu was a lonely bachelor.

182
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,214
(babies crying)

183
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,257
Yes, thank God, those days are over.

184
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,341
And the Van Houtens were enjoying

185
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,176
a storybook marriage.

186
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,141
Yeah. Lots of storybooks
have witches.

187
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,773
-Shut up, Kirk.
-Sorry.

188
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,769
And now the good people
at Fan-demonium,

189
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,021
as part of a generous settlement

190
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,612
will fire a 21 t-shirt salute.

191
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,225
(trigger cocking and gunshot)

192
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,815
{\an8}(piper piping)

193
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,071
{\an8}(trigger cocking and gunshot)

194
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,742
{\an8}(trigger cocking and gunshot)

195
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,868
{\an8}Finally!

196
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,174
Ned, my friend, please know
that the Kwik-E-Mart

197
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,422
is there for you 24 hours a day.

198
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,554
Oh, thank you, Apu.

199
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,011
And I'm going to give you

200
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,181
all of Maude's
frequent-squishee points.

201
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,300
The boys at headquarters
will not like it,

202
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,097
but I'm getting pretty sick
of them and their Bombay attitude.

203
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,431
Yeah, that's enough there, 'pu.

204
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,266
Look, Ned, I know
we ain't hung out much,

205
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,271
uh, what with your insane fear
of drinking,

206
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,313
and me being banned
from the church and all,

207
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,227
but, uh, but that Maude,
she was really something.

208
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,896
Oh, wasn't she? Thank you, Moe.
I appreciate that.

209
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,026
No, I really mean it, though.

210
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,532
I mean, if it was you that died,

211
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,203
I would have been on her so fast.

212
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,242
What are you saying?

213
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,704
What? Nothing. She was hot!

214
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,044
What, you can't take a compliment?

215
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,159
You said "hot." You monster!

216
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,246
(grunts)

217
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,920
That's good. Now, let it out.

218
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,039
That's it. Let it out.

219
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,035
Send me to Maude.

220
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,336
That's it! Ah.

221
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,249
Oh, here I come, baby! Oh, yeah!

222
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,588
(Bart chuckles) Mmm.

223
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,296
Bart? Honey, I think you should go play

224
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,715
with Rod and Todd.

225
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,925
Aw, man, why does everything bad
have to happen to me?

226
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,271
When I'm feeling low,

227
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,062
you know what always cheers me up?

228
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,806
Is it love?

229
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,937
Kindness?

230
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,686
Ooh, tough room.

231
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,896
Video games! What do you got?

232
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,066
"Billy Graham's Bible Blaster"?

233
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,615
Keep firing! Convert the heathens!

234
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,240
(video game music plays)

235
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,713
-Got him.
-No, you just winged him

236
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,249
and made him a Unitarian.

237
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,173
Look out, Bart! The gentle Baha'i!

238
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,014
-(fanfare music plays)
-All right! Full conversion.

239
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,799
Thanks, guys.
This really cheered me up.

240
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,893
(male computerized voice)
Second coming. Reload, reload.

241
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,718
Can we play now?

242
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,563
You are playing. We're a team.

243
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,271
-Yay!
-Yay!

244
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,439
Now, if there's anything,
anything at all

245
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,861
I can do to help out.

246
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,019
Quit hogging Flanders.

247
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,277
I want to comfort him.

248
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,319
(laughs)
That's nice of you, Homer,

249
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,862
but... (sniffling) I think
I'll just go to bed.

250
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,026
Then I insist on walking you home.

251
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,326
Homer, this really isn't necessary.

252
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,500
Those feelings are normal, Ned.

253
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,158
They're part of the process.

254
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,246
Watch the sprinkler.

255
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,171
Hey, that's my sprinkler.

256
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,089
It's natural to feel that way,

257
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,708
but the sprinkler is gone.

258
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,875
It's time to let go.

259
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,632
I just bought that.

260
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,134
I know, I know.

261
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,676
It's never easy.

262
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,009
Do you want anything else?
Water? Chili fries?

263
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,095
How about some white noise?

264
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,059
-(imitating white noise)
-Oh, Homer...

265
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,519
(yawning)
...you don't have to...

266
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,730
(snoring)

267
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,519
Sleep tight, Neddie.

268
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,645
(groans)

269
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,395
(door closes)

270
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,857
(rock clanging)

271
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,867
-Ah... What the...
-(rock clanging)

272
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,619
{\an8}Oh, you want a rock fight, eh?
(chuckles)

273
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,874
No, Homer! I just need to talk.

274
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,536
OK, be right down.

275
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,708
(laughs)

276
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,094
I just keep replaying
the whole thing in my head.

277
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,972
I can't believe
my last words to Maude

278
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,010
were "no foot-longs."

279
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,054
Yep, it would have been a lot better

280
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,428
if you'd said "I love you"
or "you're special".

281
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,845
You know, something sweet
instead of that hot dog crap.

282
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,944
If I'd only been a gentleman

283
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,110
and got the hot dogs myself,

284
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,978
she'd still be here.

285
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,145
Now, now, now,
don't beat yourself up.

286
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,324
I'm the one
who drove her out of her seat.

287
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,413
I'm the one who provoked
the lethal barrage of t-shirts.

288
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,409
I'm the one who parked
in the ambulance zone

289
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,661
preventing any possible resuscitation.

290
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,874
Ah, but, uh, there's no point
in playing the blame game.

291
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,115
Eh, you're right.

292
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,750
I just got to work
through the grief. (sighs)

293
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,964
There's not going to be
an easy answer.

294
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,924
Easy answer, eh?

295
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,139
Oh, yeah, that's it, baby.

296
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,259
{\an8}That's the money shot.

297
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,805
{\an8}Yeah, the camera loves you.

298
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,309
{\an8}Oh-ho-ho, you tease, you.
(chuckles)

299
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,351
Why are you taping Flanders, Dad?

300
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,685
You'll see.

301
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,610
Do you even have a job anymore?

302
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,358
I think it's pretty obvious that I don't.

303
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,857
{\an8}OK, I finished
the gardening sequence.

304
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,324
OK, from here, we star-wipe

305
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,994
to a glamor shot of Flanders

306
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,822
-paying his bills...
-(speaking indistinctly)

307
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,368
...then we star-wipe to Flanders
brushing his...

308
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,832
Dad, there are other wipes
beside star-wipes.

309
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,294
Why eat hamburger
when you can have steak?

310
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,254
I'm taking my name off this thing.

311
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,551
So, how you doing, Ned?

312
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,339
Oh, it's been
a hard couple of months,

313
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,132
but I feel like I've turned a corner.

314
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,876
Well, that's all going to change,

315
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,387
-thanks to this tape.
-Tape?

316
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,850
Now, the audio needs
some tweaking

317
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,720
and there's some footage
of Maggie being born

318
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,807
that I couldn't get rid of...

319
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,931
Anyway, enjoy.

320
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,095
HOMER: <i>Single women of Springfield,</i>

00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,321
-Is this a dating video?
-Shush.

00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,363

(chuckles)
Yeah.

00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,004
<i>Ned does everything with class.</i>

337
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,894
{\an8}<i>Oh, I would date Ned in a second</i>

339
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,604
{\an8}<i>He looks like a cuddler, that Ned.</i>

340
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,808

00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,357

00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,606

Eww...

352
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,169
Now, we'll just send this
to the dating service,

00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,672
the chicks'll fall for you, and bam!

The healing begins.

355
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,505
Homer, you obviously went
to a lot of trouble, but dating?

356
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,724
It just feels way too soon.

357
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,274
Oh-ho-ho, that's great!

358
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,478
Chicks really dig sensitivity.

359
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,439
Did you get that, Bart?

360
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,058
-Got it.
-Beautiful. And star-wipe

361
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,856
and we're out.

362
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,822
Hmm...

363
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,776
Well, with triple word score, that's 90.

364
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,775
(laughs) I guess my luck
is starting to even out.

365
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,576
Ah, I'm just a Q without a U.

366
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,540
Mm.

367
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,092
(chuckling)

368
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,047
(chuckling continues)

369
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,509
Hello?

370
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:32,852
Mailman?

371
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,227
These are the women
who saw your videotape

372
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,274
and are interested.

373
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,437
And feel free to root around
In the one-nighter bin.

374
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,855
The bin is spoken for.

375
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,525
Are you going to call all those women?

376
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,283
No, the tapes will do just fine,
thank you.

377
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,736
Homer, I'm having second thoughts.

378
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,115
This feels so disloyal to Maude.

379
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,703
Oh, wake up, Ned.

380
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,538
You think Maude
isn't dating in heaven?

381
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,463
You think she would?

382
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,630
How could she not.

383
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,958
The place is full of eligible bachelors.

384
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,804
John Wayne, Tupac Shakur,
Sherlock Holmes...

385
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,051
(chuckles) Sherlock Holmes
was just a character.

386
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,343
He sure is.

387
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,757
(sexy growl)

388
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,264
FLANDERS: OK, here goes nothing.

389
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,216
(inserts videotape)

390
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,637
WOMAN: <i>If you select me,</i>

391
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,603
<i>you'll get a lot more</i>
<i>than a Wharton MBA</i>

392
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,234
<i>pulling in 200K.</i>

393
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,810
You'll get a woman
who's poised, articulate,

394
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,396
sophisticated, confident,

395
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,821
and highly sexual.

396
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,029
Hang on, I'm getting a fax.

397
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,452
Damn, I've just been indicted.

398
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,109
Looks like we're going to have
to reschedule.

399
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,657
-How's your July?
-Well, I--

400
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,490
Mine's terrible. Let's talk in August.

401
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,124
(sighs)

402
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,752
Mmm...

403
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,667
Dinner was delicious, Edna.

404
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,419
But I can't shake the feeling

405
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,671
that you're just using me

406
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,462
to get Principal Skinner jealous.

407
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,006
Oh, please.

408
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,839
I don't care what
Mr. Engaged-to-be-engaged thinks.

409
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,756
Hear that, Seymour?

410
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,184
SKINNER (over phone):
<i>Edna, this is childish.</i>

411
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,222
Fine, then hang up.

412
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,184
SKINNER (over phone):
<i>I will hang up when he leaves.</i>

413
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,385
(sighs)

414
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,147
Well, Diane,
I've sure enjoyed chatting with you

415
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,728
about your problems
with your mother.

416
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,978
Did you hear that, Foofie?

417
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,855
Sounds like somebody loves us.

418
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,442
-(chuckles)
-DIANE: Yes, he does.

419
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,567
Yeah, well, maybe
I'll call you again sometime.

420
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:15,155
Ooh, Foofie doesn't like
the sound of that "maybe"

421
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,582
'cause him's a commitment dog.

422
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,911
Isn't him?

423
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,746
(panicks)

424
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,379
{\an8}So how'd you do tonight, Romeo?

425
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,423
Well, I just can't relate
to the women of today, Homer.

426
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,801
Ah, it's probably me.

427
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,054
I'm about as exciting
as a baked potato.

428
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,056
You're darn right you are.

429
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,558
And you've got lots
of other great qualities, too.

430
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,810
That's right, Ned.

431
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,982
Those floozies we married
in Vegas were crazy about you.

432
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,982
What floozies?
What are you talking...

433
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,404
Marge, we're trying to help Ned.

434
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,032
Lord, I never question you,

435
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,940
but I've been wondering

436
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,278
if your decision to take Maude was...

437
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,203
well, wrong.

438
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,411
Unless this is part of your divine plan.

439
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,124
Oh... could you just give me
some kind of sign?

440
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,616
Anything?

441
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,212
Oh, and after all that
church chocolate I bought,

442
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,045
which by the way, was gritty

443
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,631
and had that white stuff on it.
(sniffles)

444
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,547
Well, I've had it.

445
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,350
Daddy, get up.
You'll be late for church.

446
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,056
Well, you boys can go
with the Simpsons.

447
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,436
I'm not going to church today.

448
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,073
-(both gasping)
-That's right.

449
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,151
And I may not go
to church tomorrow.

450
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,735
(both screaming)

451
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,356
No, I'm not kidding.

452
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,697
I am going to sit right here
and miss church.

453
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,162
You just watch.

454
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,584
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry...

455
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,957
While our organist
is on a much-needed vacation,

456
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,554
we thought we'd try something new.

457
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,839
So get down
and put your knees together

458
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,973
for the Christian Rock Stylings
of... Kovenant.

459
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,099
Hey, isn't that
the bass player from Satanica?

460
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,813
I think it is.

461
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,097
(tires screech)

462
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,612
(gasps)
Electric guitars in church?

463
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,612
Oh, my gosh.

464
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,903
Some dropouts must have
overpowered the reverend.

465
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,236
This is a love song about a dude
I met in a sleazy motel.

466
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,746
-(gasps)
-A dude named God.

467
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,249

00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,698
I'll be right back, boys.

495
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,030
I'm going to go help that lady.

496
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,157
Homer, you help, too.

497
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,742
I toileth not on ye sabbath, woman.

00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,787

-Hmm.

{\an8}(grunting)

500
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,250
Ah, that was a lovely song.
(chuckles)

501
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,091
It really got to me.

502
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,972
Been through
some rough times yourself?

503
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,009
I... I recently lost my wife.

504
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,603
(gasps)
I'm real sorry to hear that.

505
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,099
We just lost our drummer.

506
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,220
{\an8}To a Pentecostal ska band.

507
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,887
{\an8}Uh, I mean I know
it's not the same but...

508
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,136
No, I hear what you're saying.

509
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,057
It's always hard to replace someone.

510
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,266
Yeah.

511
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,855
My name's Rachel Jordan.

512
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,860
If you feel like talking,
maybe we could grab a coffee.

513
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,613
Well, that... that sounds
real nice, Rachel, but, uh...

514
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,948
I'm (clears throat)
I'm not quite...

515
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,371
{\an8}I understand.

516
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,739
{\an8}Listen, we're heading out on tour

517
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,827
{\an8}with the Monsters of Christian Rock.

518
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,162
Maybe when we get back,
you and I could get together.

519
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,418
(chuckles) Maybe we can.

520
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,503
My name is Ned Flanders

521
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,094
And I'm here every week.

522
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,553
