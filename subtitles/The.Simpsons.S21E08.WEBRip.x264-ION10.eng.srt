00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,999
a real-life Jaws bit
off my dad's wiener.

353
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,670
Come on, I'd be an awesome
big brother!

354
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,539
I've got video games!
A tree house!

355
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,876
A garage stuffed to the rafters
with illegal fireworks!

356
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,877
Oh, sweet Meerschaum,

357
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,636
take me away.

358
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,928
Uh-oh.

359
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,931
I'm sorry, kid.
It's not gonna happen.

360
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,973
I'd give my brother
everything I have!

361
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,057
He could be the race car
in Monopoly!

362
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,062
(sobbing):
Monopoly!

363
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,114
The race car!

364
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,947
Wake up!

365
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,409
I'm Bart Simpson.

366
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,659
Who the hell are you?

367
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm your new brother!

368
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,405
Are you from the orphanage,

369
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,333
or do I really
not understand

370
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,712
how babies are born?

371
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,207
So, Charlie, how did you escape
the island of misfit boys?

372
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,757
Shinnied down
a drainpipe.

373
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,970
You like to shinny?
I like to shinny.

374
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,930
Where do you see yourself
in 20 years?

375
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,181
One-armed drummer
in a prison rock band.

376
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,853
Nice! Favorite Beatle?

377
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,681
Dung.

378
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:52,975
Me, too!

379
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,188
There must be some reason
no one ever adopted you.

380
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,769
Is one of your
feet a hand?

381
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,524
People only want
to adopt babies.

382
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,437
Babies?

383
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,574
We've got one of those.

384
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,070
(scoffs) Overrated.

385
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,162
Shop it somewhere
else, sister.

386
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,081
(groans)

387
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,116
(humming)

388
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,206
Dad, this is Charlie,
my new, um,

389
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,964
-best friend.
-Hello, sir.

390
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,046
You're going to be seeing a lot
of him around the house.

391
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,222
Well, welcome,
Charlie!

392
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,260
Nice to meet ya!

393
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,473
No glasses--
way to go!

394
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,813
(whispering):
This one's a keeper!

395
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,139
-(children playing)
<i>-BART: Yo!</i>

396
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,523
Check out my brother, Charlie!

397
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,810
Brother?

398
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,063
What are you talking about?

399
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,314
How come I've never
seen him before?

400
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,266
Uh, he was born
with two noses

401
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,477
and we hid him away

402
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,856
till we could afford
to cut one off.

403
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,243
Oh, yeah!

404
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,239
-Yeah.
-Two noses!

405
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,450
You deserve
a brother, Bart.

406
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,120
(crying):
You deserve
good things!

407
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,504
♪♪

408
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,254
When poking a
dead animal,

409
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,206
don't go straight
for the eye.

410
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,626
Build up to it.

00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,927

413
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,518
My son, afraid
of water.

(chomping)

415
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,227
So, Lisa, how do you like
sharing a bathroom

416
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,396
with two brothers?

417
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,694
Two brothers?

418
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,947
Bart, who is
this kid?

419
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,158
Be cool, be cool--
he's an orphan.

420
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,449
You know,
just like Annie,

421
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,332
except he's a dude
and he hates tomorrow.

422
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,159
I hate it so much!

423
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,754
Bart, you have to take him back!

424
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,170
You're just jealous 'cause now
I've got what you've got

425
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,499
with Maggie, only better because
we're dudes with 'tudes!

426
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,344
(humming)

427
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,382
(both humming)

428
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,965
Kids, calm down! Here.

429
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,011
Have a Not Very Berry Blast.

430
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,755
It goes great with our
"notton candy."

431
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,139
Awesome, they made
a sequel to <i>Sever IV.</i>

432
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,557
This movie's going to be
great, full of blood and gore

433
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,016
and torture and guts and...

434
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,316
Two kid's tickets for

435
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,439
<i>The Diversity Kittens.</i>

436
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,396
...and murder and swears
and brains and basements

437
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,317
and bones and saws and lungs
and faces worn as hats.

438
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,328
(spooky music plays)

439
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,409
Hmm.

440
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,584
Now, you probably think <i>Sever V</i>
is a rip-off of <i>Sever IV,</i>

441
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,916
but it's actually based

442
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,211
on the rich history
of Hong Kong torture films.

443
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,836
(shuddering)

444
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,923
Uh-oh.

445
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,223
The boogeyman's going
to eat my brain!

446
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,814
(shuddering)

447
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,849
I'm sorry. I guess having
a little brother

448
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,482
is more responsibility
than I thought,

449
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,519
especially
'cause I thought

450
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,942
it'd be no
responsibility at all.

451
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,520
-(rustling)
-Aah, it's the
boogeyman!

452
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,976
There is no such thing
as a boogeyman.

453
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,187
Boogie, boogie,
boogie, boogie, boogie!

454
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,606
(both scream)

455
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,872
Simpson, step away
from the orphan. Do not
give him any more love.

456
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,000
I repeat, do not give him
any more love.

457
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,580
Mr. Policeman,
please take me home.

458
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,995
That mean boy took me
to a scary movie

459
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,415
and he covered
his sister's doll

460
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,423
in peanut butter
and bird seed.

461
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,965
Charlie, you'd rat on me?

462
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,552
Hey, no, no, what do
you think you're do--?

463
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,058
(screaming)

464
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,431
My snout,

465
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,268
my beautiful snout!

466
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,978
(both laughing)

467
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,274
(grunts)

468
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,567
Sorry, dude, I didn't see you.

469
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,650
(sobbing):
How could you not see me?

470
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,195
My arms are like hams.

471
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,699
Hams!

472
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,664
Hey!

473
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,122
Go ahead, leave.

474
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,952
That's what you're good at!

475
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,037
(gulps)

476
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,582
(both panting)

477
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,706
Where are we going
to hide?

478
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,133
(mutters)

479
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,183
The same place Eskimos
hide from penguins.

480
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,518
Now, Charlie,
we'll have to live

481
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,559
off what we find
in the garbage--

482
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,892
banana strings,
muffin liners--

483
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,518
but it'll be cool
'cause it's just you and me.

484
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,475
LISA:
Hello, Bart.

485
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,435
(gasps)

486
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,654
How did you find us?

487
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,823
You left a trail
of lost winter clothes.

488
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,113
Are you gonna turn us in?

489
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,196
No, I'm gonna convince you
to turn yourselves in.

490
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,493
-Never.
-Never, huh?
What are you going to eat?

491
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,367
Snow-- God's cotton candy.

492
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,543
Huh, snow, hmm?

493
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,832
Better change
your mind quick, Bart.

494
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,955
A snow plow is coming
to seal us in.

495
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,092
The Plow King lives!

496
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,460
And Bart, maybe Charlie
can't be your little brother,

497
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,877
but you'll always be
a big brother to me.

498
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,966
Please don't send me
back, Bart.

499
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,101
This was
the best day of my life.

500
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,135
Oh, no!

501
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,191
You took too long to make
an obvious decision!

502
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,734
Don't worry,
me and Charlie have

503
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,937
one thing
you'll never have.

504
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,738
Point and shoot, bro,
point and shoot.

505
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,075
Oh, gross, gross,
gross, gross.

506
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,793
Hey, you're alive,
aren't you?

507
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,253
I wish I weren't.

508
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,754
I'm here to visit Charlie.

509
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,085
Charlie?
He's gone.

510
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,340
A nice new family
adopted him.

511
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,342
Now he has six
wonderful sisters.

512
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,545
He's so cute.

513
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,675
Let's do his nails.

514
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,721
He's my baby.
He's <i>my </i>baby.

515
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,224
-Mom!
-I'm telling.

516
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,346
Dad!

517
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,392
I want ice cream.

518
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,055
I'm a princess.
No, <i>I'm </i>a princess.

519
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,273
She got juice
on my sweater.

520
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,103
-Big cheater.
-You're the cheater.

521
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:31,938
Ugly.

522
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,272
So many sisters.

523
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,938
Save me, Bart.

524
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,067
I know
you miss him, boy,

525
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,874
so let's you and me spend some
quality father and son time.

526
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,580
(suspenseful music plays)

527
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,450
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,495

00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,329
That's so fake.

530
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,424
<i>That's </i>so fake.

531
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,329
I don't know how they--

532
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,036
(character, Bart,
and Homer scream)

533
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,706
Too real! (shudders)

534
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,255
-(laughing)
-(chainsaw roars,
character screams)

535
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,628
-(metal scraping)
-Oh, come on.

536
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,764
(both scream)

537
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,470
-Look out!
-(both laugh)

538
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,090
-Why would that guy--?
-(chainsaw roars)

539
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,547
-(both scream)
-Look out!

540
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,927
-(both laugh)
-That's fake.

<i>DICK:</i>
<i>Take it, Tom!</i>

543
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,515
<i>Take it, Tom!</i>

544
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,234
<i>Hey, wait a minute.</i>
<i>Wait, hold it, hold it.</i>

545
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,444
-(music stops)
<i>-I said, "Take it, Tom."</i>

546
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,404
<i>Did you hear me say,</i>
<i>"Take it, Tom"?</i>

547
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,404
<i>TOMMY (stammering):</i>
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>hear you say, "Take it."</i>

548
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,106
<i>Well, what did you</i>
<i>think you heard?</i>

549
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,447
<i>I didn't, I didn't think</i>
<i>I heard what you think you</i>
<i>said.</i>

550
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,083
<i>Well, what do</i>
<i>you think I said?</i>

551
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,199
<i>Well, I...</i>
<i>I, I heard...</i>

552
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,537
<i>-It sounded like you said</i>
<i>"naked bacon."</i>
<i>-"Naked bacon"?</i>

553
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,372
<i>-Sounded like "naked bacon."</i>
<i>-It sounded like I said...</i>

554
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,957
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Did somebody say "naked bacon"?</i>

555
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,172
<i>-Yeah, see?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

556
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,462
<i>We all thought</i>
<i>it was "naked bacon."</i>

557
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,375
<i>Yeah, it sounded like</i>
<i>"naked bacon" to me.</i>

558
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,673
<i>I don't know why they say</i>
<i>you're the dumb guy, Tom.</i>

559
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,927
<i>I don't know, either.</i>

560
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,009
<i>(stammering):</i>
<i>You said "naked bacon."</i>

561
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,724
<i>I definitely said,</i>
<i>uh, "Take it, Tom."</i>

562
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,764
<i>-(stammering): But if you...</i>
<i>-No, you said "naked bacon."</i>

563
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,228
<i>That's what I thought.</i>
<i>We both agree...</i>

564
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,479
<i>You may both agree,</i>
<i>but folk singers</i>

565
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,101
<i>never say, "Take it,</i>
<i>naked bacon."</i>

566
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,687
<i>Do you guys know</i>
<i>"Funkytown"?</i>
