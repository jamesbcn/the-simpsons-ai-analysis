00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,272
{\an8}(sipping)

349
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,718
{\an8}...and that’s
how I got

350
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,938
the vending machine
contract for the Kremlin.

351
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,938
(polite laughter)

352
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,020
(door opens, growling)

353
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,436
Sorry, sir.

354
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,984
Traffic was
a nightmare.

355
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,857
Then I got caught in some
kind of garlic festival.

356
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,315
(menacing):
Release the hounds.

357
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,065
(barking, screaming)

358
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,776
HOMER:
Stop it, Winston!

359
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,077
In the wake of this deception,
I had two questions for Homer:

360
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,251
"Why lie?" and "Lies... why?"

361
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,001
But he seemed
less than eager to meet.

362
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,673
Homer, I brought
a squeaky!

363
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,671
(squeaking)

364
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,672
(shrieks)

365
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,586
(toy squeaking)

366
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,426
(yelling)

367
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,184
(toy squeaking)

368
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,175
(yells)

369
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,523
(toy squeaking)

370
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,273
(shrieks, grunts)

371
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,074
Ooh! Ah! Ah!

372
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,031
Help!

373
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,071
<i>DECLAN:</i>
<i>I realized that if this bunny</i>
<i>was going to be boiled,</i>

374
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,066
<i>I would have</i>
<i>to turn up the heat.</i>

375
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,368
LENNY:
There you are!

376
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,581
I’m ready
for <i>my </i>segment.

377
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,751
(chuckles):
Lenny...

378
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,249
always exciting
to hear from you.

379
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,382
Did you ever try
that new shampoo?

380
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,170
Nope, never did.

381
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,337
Want to watch me
pay my cable bill?

382
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,304
I got checks with
butterflies on them.

383
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,803
I <i>am </i>interesting.

384
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,098
No, you’re not.

385
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,597
What do you want?

386
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,733
Marge, can you just
let me in for a minute?

387
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,480
We let you in
32 years ago

388
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,812
and it’s brought us
nothing but pain.

389
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,148
Well, if you want, I can
cut you out of the film.

390
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,233
No, no, no, no, no!

391
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,898
Let’s not get crazy.

392
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:49,616
Then I just want to know why
your husband did what he did.

393
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,158
HOMER:
I’ll tell you why.

394
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,582
It’s been another eight years
and what do I have?

395
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,712
Same job, same house,
same dirty joke book.

396
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,089
(weak laughter)

397
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,012
I just thought for once I could
be the cool guy in your movie.

398
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,972
But all I am is the guy who
makes everyone else look good.

399
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,264
Strong words
from a dumpy man.

400
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,518
And cut.

401
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,769
Wait just a
cotton-swabbing minute!

402
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,271
A good man went to a lot of
trouble just to impress you.

403
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,775
And I went along with it
because I love him to pieces.

404
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,528
And you made him
look like a fool.

405
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,821
Well, I don’t want you
anywhere near my house!

406
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,195
Now you can cut!

407
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,372
What’s the matter, Declan?

408
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,741
Did a cop give you
a ticket

409
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,078
for talking
like a fruit?

410
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,502
It’s the oddest thing.

411
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,790
I actually feel affection

412
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,293
for these knuckle-dragging
sub-monkeys.

413
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,456
I feel sorry
for Homer Simpson.

414
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,415
What, have you been
sipping cuckoo juice?

415
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,915
Homer’s got it made.

416
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,587
He’s married to one
hell of a woman.

417
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,335
All I’ve got
is this porn channel

418
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,137
I’m too cheap
to descramble.

419
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,430
That’s an ad
for shoe inserts.

420
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,314
What the....?

421
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,100
I’ve been writing creepy
letters to that?

422
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,983
But what you said
about Homer, it’s...

423
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,100
it’s given me
a brilliant idea!

424
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,727
An action movie
where I play the Pope

425
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,194
who kills the president?

426
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,614
No, that’s a
terrible idea.

427
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,652
Yeah, I know.
It’s stupid.

428
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,775
I think
it could work, though.

429
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,571
I’ve even got a title:
<i>Pontiff No Return.</i>

430
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,865
I came up with it, but
I don’t really get it.

431
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,159
<i>DECLAN:</i>
<i>The next day, I invited Homer</i>
<i>to my editing bay.</i>

432
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,134
Oh, my God, the view!

433
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,049
This makes it all worth it!

434
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,088
Yeah, it’s not so much
fun when you’re blind.

435
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,012
At least you made it
up the mountain.

436
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,300
No thanks
to you two.

437
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,261
All right,
you lured me to your bay.

438
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,015
Now what sick game
are you playing?

439
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,768
I have some footage
to show you.

440
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,100
O, spirit!

441
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,975
Are you gonna show me my future?

442
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,732
My snow-flecked grave,
mourned by no man?

443
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,614
Well, it’s not too late
for me to change!

444
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,821
You there, boy!

445
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,571
Buy me a Christmas goose!

446
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,282
The biggest one in the shop!

447
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,912
BOY (squeaky-voiced):
And then what?

448
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,279
Homer, come over here
and take a look at this.

449
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,746
I’ve gone over 100,000 hours
of Springfield footage--

450
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,418
twice-- and put together
something you must see.

451
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,916
If I could trade lives with
anybody, I’d pick Homer.

452
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,514
Have you been to Homer’s house?

453
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,549
It’s got a back yard,
a front yard...

454
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,973
The place is like yard city!

455
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,221
I love his laugh.

456
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,346
He picked the perfect time
to lock in his mortgage.

457
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,390
He’s the kindest,
sweetest, most generous man

458
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,185
ever to drive through
my living room.

459
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,558
I’ll pay for most of this!

460
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,018
He may not be perfect,
but he’s my dad.

461
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,568
Homer gave me a kidney.

462
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,912
It wasn’t his, I didn’t need it,
and it came postage due,

463
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,528
but still, a lovely gesture.

464
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,696
I like when
Daddy’s out of work

465
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,785
’cause he can spend
more time with me.

466
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,754
At bedtime, he tucks me in
tighter than anyone else could.

467
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,246
And you know what?

468
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,837
No monsters have gotten me yet.

469
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,093
Wow...

470
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,594
I have a pretty good life
after all.

471
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,137
Homer!
Don’t kill the foreign man!

472
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,601
(chuckling):
Relax, Marge.

473
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,521
I wasn’t
gonna kill him.

474
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,857
All those years I was dreaming
of other things,

475
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,688
I was actually doing
what I really wanted:

476
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,244
hanging out with my family,
drinking with my friends,

477
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,409
making friends with my family
and hanging with my drinking.

478
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,290
Marge, you’re my
real dream come true.

479
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,078
And I get to live you
every day.

480
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,083
Oh, Homie!

481
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,455
You make each eight-year
interval better than the last!

482
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,713
Oh...

483
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,255
So, Homer, are you at peace
with your lot in life?

484
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,720
Absolutely.

485
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,840
Hey, is that
a mixing board?

486
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,137
Uh, no, no.
It’s something else.

487
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,140
Yes, it is.

488
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,681
Look, I need to lay
down some tracks.

489
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,024
I’m making a demo tape.

490
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,690
By the time you come back
in eight years,

491
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,229
I’ll be the world’s
richest rock star!

492
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,154
