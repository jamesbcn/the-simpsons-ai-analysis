{\an8}<i>Now, I want you to eat</i>
<i>a gallon of ice cream</i>

175
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,940
{\an8}<i>in under two minutes.</i>

176
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,653
{\an8}But I just did that.

177
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,283
{\an8}<i>You now have one minute, 55 seconds.</i>

178
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,701
(Bart and Milhouse laugh)

179
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,624
I'm going to like being an adult. (laughs)

180
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,615
<i>(groaning)</i>

181
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,876
Now you're the same height as your dad.

182
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,718
(in normal voice)
I can reach the poisons now,

183
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,722
each with an inviting skull
and crossbones.

184
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,055
Kirk, you're wearing
that shirt I bought you.

185
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,642
I thought you didn't like it.

186
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,477
(in Kirk's voice)
I love when you buy me clothes.

187
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,312
You know what's itchy and what's not.

188
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,647
Oh, Kirk Evelyn Van Houten.

189
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,074
(humming happily)

190
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,702
(in regular voice)
I wish my dad

191
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,488
could have been here
to see my parents kiss.

192
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,993
Now, did you get Kirk's license?

193
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,704
-Uh-huh.
<i>-Ay, caramba!</i>

194
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,945
I rented a truck.

195
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,458
I'm driving a truck.

196
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,830
I crashed a truck.

197
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,337
I rented another truck.

198
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,013
Hey, Simpson, don't you have
a lame dad of your own?

199
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,183
(in Kirk's voice)
Uh, I-I'd give you all my money,

200
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,932
but my wallet is Velcroed too tight.

201
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,354
You're the wussiest adult I've ever seen.

202
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,523
An adult-- he's buying it.

203
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,189
Kirk, remember,

204
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,935
you have the superpowers
of a middle-aged man.

205
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,624
Hello, Mr. Kirk.

206
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,201
I want to buy this beer, uh, cigarettes,

207
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,617
magazines with boobs
and three pairs of sunglasses.

208
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,287
Polarized.

209
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,206
I suspect you are buying
for underage bullies,

210
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,795
but as that is 98% of my business,

211
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,801
I say, "Thank you, sir. Come again."

212
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,893
Yo, Bart.

213
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,298
Your grown-man friend is all right.

214
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,427
We should start threatening more adults.

215
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,104
Wouldn't that make us
criminals instead of bullies?

216
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,563
Let's beat up a philosopher
until he gives us the answer.

217
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,734
-Oh, good idea.
-Yeah, I'm in.

218
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,563
I made my mom happy

219
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,358
and got through the
bullies without a punch.

220
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,941
Being an adult is super easy.

221
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,147
Hmm, hmm... hmm.

222
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,909
-(pops)
-(chuckles)

223
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,242
You dope.

224
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,077
It says those are for her pleasure.

225
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,542
Now it's time for me to live my fantasy

226
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,383
with mature themes.

227
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,958
I'll go behind that curtain a boy

228
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,214
but come out a man.

229
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,138
Hmm, more money for schools.

230
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,468
That could translate into more homework.

231
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,934
I know this is highly illegal,

232
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,273
but you're not leaving
this booth till you punch yes.

233
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,929
Don't bother screaming for help.

234
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,807
This is a municipal off-cycle election.

235
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,975
There's no one for miles.

236
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,404
(wolf howling)

237
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,744
Don't forget your sticker.

238
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,493
(evil chuckling)

239
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,120
Uh, hey, bartender.

240
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,163
We'd like two milks,

241
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,957
and then you can tell us
where babies come from.

242
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,381
Oh, well, in my case,

243
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,460
my mom was hit with a voodoo curse.

244
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,505
I gestated for five years,

245
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,379
then I popped out backwards and on fire.

246
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,717
-Really?
-Oh, yeah, keep my tail

247
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,642
-right here in this jar.
-(both gasp)

248
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,561
Good times.

249
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,519
Mom, I think Maggie misses TV.

250
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,154
You know, Mom, I was thinking

251
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,732
we could take Maggie downtown.

252
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,697
The Jazz Hole is featuring
a Dizzy Gillespie tribute band.

253
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,279
(gasps) Their trumpeter
has the puffiest cheeks.

254
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,735
I don't think so.

255
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,285
The U.S. Embassy has warned people

256
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,868
not to go to downtown Springfield.

257
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,544
I get it. Middle child,

258
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,373
never do what I want.

259
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,378
Hmm.

260
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,340
Okay, I also know of a puppet show.

261
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,642
Long before the Teutonic slaughters

262
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,771
visited upon our people,

263
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,928
there was the massacre by Mstislov

264
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,727
of Kiev in 1132.

265
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,852
(screaming)

266
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,518
Maybe we should go.

267
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,106
Nobody leave till every puppet dead.

268
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,780
Bart, you wanted to show me something?

269
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,412
Just one sec. Nelson gave me
some notes on a prank I'm doing.

270
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,581
Now, I asked you here because
I know a cool grown-up

271
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,674
who will take you to that club
in the city.

272
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,169
Really? Who?

273
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,667
(in Kirk's voice)
Hello, Lisa.

274
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,054
Milhouse?

275
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,800
Milhouse? Who's Milhouse?

276
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,683
I mean, he-he's my son.

277
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,930
Well, Milhouse,

278
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,141
you might get past the bouncer
at the jazz club,

279
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,522
because they're in no position
to turn anyone away,

280
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,769
but it doesn't matter,
'cause we can't pay

281
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,772
for the gas
and the cover fee anyway.

282
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,024
Au contraire, starfish hair.

283
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,977
The Baby Poindexter Company
is being forced to pay

284
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,647
a settlement to any parent

285
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,735
who had enough misguided love
to buy their videos.

286
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,621
They're not gonna write a check
to a couple of kids.

287
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,739
Then I will be your guys' dad.

288
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,787
(screams)

289
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,251
Thanks, but lowering your voice
and standing on paint cans

290
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,171
doesn't make you man enough to be my dad.

291
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,632
HOMER: Marge, can I get a subscription
to <i>Highlights</i> magazine?

292
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,213
MARGE:
Homer, that's for children.

293
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,838
HOMER:
Where does it say that?

294
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,724
MARGE:
Read the rest of the title.

295
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,471
HOMER:
<i>Highlights</i><i>for...</i> d'oh!

296
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,227
(Homer humming)

297
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,640
Oh, dang it.

298
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,978
I lost my other earring.

299
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,402
Leave it to me.

300
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,320
-Earring.
-Oh.

301
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,025
-Thimble from Monopoly game.
-Wondered where that was.

302
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,406
-$25 casino chip.
-Oh.

303
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,253
-The smallest nesting doll.
-Oh.

304
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,040
Can you find anything
you like in this bed?

305
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,634
Just my honey pie.

306
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,750
Want to split it while we snuggle?

307
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,587
Mm-hmm.

308
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,512
(Homer chewing loudly)

309
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,131
MARGE:
Now what are you doing?

310
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,547
HOMER:
Licking the wrapper.

311
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,510
There you go, one adult

312
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,387
and two children one-way downtown.

313
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:37,234
Um, as adults, what do we do now?
Shake hands?

314
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,651
If you like.

315
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,320
And that's how you do it. (chuckles)

316
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,571
Now, remember, I can't sit backwards

317
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,783
or I get sick.

318
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,912
Well, if I look at your face, I get sick.

319
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,579
Young man, apologize to your sister.

320
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,159
Make me, baldy.

321
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,623
Why, you little...

322
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,163
(grunting)

323
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,627
(in normal voice)
My adulthood!

324
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,498
(grunting)

325
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,628
I never thought I'd say this,

326
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,763
but that is conduct
unbecoming of a bus station.

327
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,930
Where'd your babies go?

328
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,265
Your intellect-deadening DVDs
turned my brother's brain to jelly.

329
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,022
Pretty shapes tell me to kill everybody.

330
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,942
Looks like you're entitled
to the full rebate of $19.95.

331
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,026
That's all you pay
for screwing up a child for life?

332
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,413
(in Kirk's voice)
Kids, let me handle this.

333
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,620
Uh, we'd like it in singles
and nickels, please.

334
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,622
Terrific. Just need your signature.

335
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,294
-In cursive?
-"X" is fine.

336
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,213
In cursive?

337
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,291
Oh, it's just enough to get home.

338
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,168
I'm hungry <i>now.</i>

339
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,255
Hey, I'm walking on paint cans all day.

340
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,760
Give me a break.

341
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,512
Guys, look, free breakfast

342
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,974
if we sit through a sales pitch.

343
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,604
Just remember, Milhouse,
do not buy the condo.

344
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,102
But what if we can't afford
not to buy it?

345
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,819
Waldo, Waldo, Waldo.

346
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,988
Homer, Bart said the kids were
going to the Van Houtens',

347
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,898
but Luann just told me
they're supposed to be here.

348
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,158
They've disappeared.

349
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,699
We'll get those kids back.

350
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,582
Because we just bought them new shoes.

351
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,751
Waldo, Waldo.

352
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,052
Do you think Lisa went to that jazz club

353
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,459
I wouldn't take her to?

354
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,337
How many kids will jazz corrupt?

355
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,259
(tires squealing)

356
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:37,013
...lap pool and fully-equipped gym
with eucalyptus towels.

357
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,387
Now, let me give you

358
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,024
the 14 different apartment configurations.

359
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,391
The hacienda,

360
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,648
the urban oasis,

361
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,109
castle in the sky,

362
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,939
Connecticut sunset...

363
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,034
Lady, my stomach's full,
and I want to go.

364
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,899
That's how it works in this country.

365
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,446
-(beeps)
-If you try to leave,

366
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,859
you'll find the doors are locked.

367
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,077
Well, before our dad signs any contracts,

368
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,658
he has a surprise for you.

369
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,964
Oh, I hope it's that he's single.

370
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,249
(laughs) I'm single.

371
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,633
Though, some days,

372
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,919
I have a girl buddy on field trips.

373
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,633
You're a bit of a freak.

374
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,134
I like that.

375
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:15,006
(giggling)

376
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,854
You're the adult.

377
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,310
-(grunts)
-(lock clicks)

378
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,230
LISA: Kirk, don't you have
something to tell her?

379
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,312
Just looking for a casual hookup?

380
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,147
Yeah, for my Thomas the Tank Engines.

381
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,244
Ooh, I love how I don't exactly understand

382
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,610
what you're saying.

383
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,369
Homie, do you see anything?

384
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,279
No. I'm sorry.

385
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,368
It's... Wait a minute.

386
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,418
When I said you needed a software update,

387
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,255
it was not a criticism.

388
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,427
We found what we're looking for.

389
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,723
The kids?

390
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,596
Sure, they could be here.
Who knows?

391
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,023
(tires squealing)

392
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,692
Ooh, I love how your arms

393
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,190
are too short and thin for your legs.

394
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,113
Just like a crocodile.

395
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,651
(in Duffman's voice)
I'm feeling a strange,

396
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,534
refreshing brew of emotions.
Oh, yeah.

397
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,742
-(grunts)
-Milhouse?

398
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,243
(in normal voice)
How'd you know it was me?

399
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,994
The top of your head has a 5:00 shadow.

400
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,077
(gasp) Your hair is growing back.

401
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,374
Tell me your secret.

402
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,286
He's ten years old.

403
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,915
Oh, there's always a catch.

404
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,342
Is anyone here going to buy a condo?

405
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,341
It's gonna be yes, but don't rush me.

406
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,675
And worst of all, you cast my vote.

407
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,930
Who did you vote for
in the nonpartisan judicial election?

408
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,354
Williamson.

409
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,892
No, no, no.

410
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,185
I'm really sorry, Dad,

411
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,189
but I have to say,

412
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,361
it was pretty cool having your life.

413
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
You mean that?

414
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,154
I'd be happy to wind up

415
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,364
just like you.

416
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,994
I hope you remember that

417
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,780
when I can't pay for your college.

418
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,534
Now, how would you like to go
to your own parent-teacher interview

419
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,037
while I see a movie?

420
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,828
I'd like that.

421
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,422
Son, promise you will never look like me.

422
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,708
I sure hope not.

423
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,381
Why, you little...

424
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,210
That's not a heart-warming
thing to end on!
