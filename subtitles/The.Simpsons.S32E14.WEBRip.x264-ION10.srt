1
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:11,189
<i>Happy birthday, dear Carl</i>

2
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:15,097
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

3
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:18,370
<i>And Lenny More...</i>

4
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:21,610
Carl, for your birthday,
I oiled your barstool.

5
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:26,620
- Y'ello.
- It's me, Homer.

6
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:29,560
Marge, I'm so sorry
I'm still here.

7
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:32,398
It's just, it's Carl's birthday.

8
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:34,068
Right. It's Carl's birthday.

9
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:36,072
Then it's Lenny's half birthday.

10
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:38,076
Then it's Canadian Thanksgiving.

11
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:41,082
Don't forget Tu BiShvat,
the Jewish Arbor Day.

12
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,188
Just don't drive home
drunk, Homer.

13
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:45,658
I'm serious.

14
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,332
Sometimes there's advantages
to living and dying alone.

15
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:52,505
I could drive off a cliff,
free as a bird.

16
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:55,010
I'm heading home now.

17
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:57,181
- Moe, take my keys.
- Yeah, you got it, pal.

18
00:00:57,247 --> 00:00:59,418
I'll keep 'em safe
till you're sober.

19
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:00,989
Make me two sets of these

20
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:02,626
and get 'em to me
by closing time.

21
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:09,138
Homer, Homer,
let me call you an Uber.

22
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:12,411
Are you...

23
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:13,681
Homer?

24
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:16,152
Geez, you're better off walking.

25
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,427
Take me to Moe's.

26
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:21,830
Hey. We're here.

27
00:01:21,897 --> 00:01:24,068
You're good. Five stars.

28
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,343
<i>There's liquor on my brain</i>

29
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,051
<i>I'm peeing in the drain</i>

30
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:35,290
<i>What a glorious feeling</i>

31
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:39,031
<i>I'm blotto again</i>

32
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,438
<i>I'm talking too loud</i>

33
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:45,712
<i>Being friendly with Kirk</i>

34
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:48,818
<i>There's no way in hell</i>

35
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:52,224
<i>I'll be ready for work</i>

36
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:55,732
We have other cops in this town?

37
00:01:58,303 --> 00:02:01,409
Marge, you see,
there's a little hitch.

38
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:03,213
I'm in jail...

39
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,383
I knew it.
I knew you'd screw up.

40
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,889
I wasn't driving.
I was walking.

41
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:11,229
I wasn't a danger,
just a disgrace.

42
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:12,899
Don't come home tonight.

43
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,603
- But...
- Just don't.

44
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:24,121
I always thought that
rock bottom would feel more fun.

45
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:26,960
Well, sometimes
when you're at rock bottom,

46
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:30,167
anywhere you look,
you can see the stars.

47
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,304
- Cletus!
- Hiya, friend.

48
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:35,076
What you said is very wise.

49
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:37,181
Well, I went to M.I.T.T.

50
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:40,120
The Mississippi Institute
of Trailer Trash.

51
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:41,523
Go, Book Burners.

52
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,527
What are you in for?

53
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:45,965
Oh, cops don't respect us
hill folk.

54
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,504
Every three months,
they shut down my still

55
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,340
and take the hooch.

56
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:54,014
Hey, this moonshine
made me go blind!

57
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:56,452
Oh, wait,
my hat's just over my eyes.

58
00:02:58,022 --> 00:02:59,793
Oh, wait. I am blind.

59
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,630
At least your wife's
not mad at you.

60
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:02,966
Aw, well.

61
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:06,506
Hey, Officer!
This prison got itself a guitar?

62
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:07,842
Of course.

63
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:10,213
Yeah, I prefer acoustic.

64
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:15,791
Well, since neither of us
can be home tonight,

65
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:18,029
let me bring home to us.

66
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:23,507
<i>I had all the wealth
that a man could want</i>

67
00:03:23,574 --> 00:03:25,110
<i>A wife and some kids</i>

68
00:03:25,176 --> 00:03:28,684
<i>Who love me</i>

69
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,453
<i>Apple blossoms</i>

70
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,959
<i>And tasty possums</i>

71
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:35,463
<i>And the good Lord</i>

72
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,467
<i>Up above me</i>

73
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:42,144
<i>Fort Knox don't compare</i>

74
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,415
<i>To what we got there</i>

75
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:48,156
<i>'Cause our home is where</i>

76
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:52,999
<i>My gold is</i>

77
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,836
Yes, it is.

78
00:03:54,903 --> 00:03:59,178
Officer Lou, does this jail have
a self-reflection mirror?

79
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:01,115
Here you go.

80
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:02,685
I got to be a better man.

81
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:04,956
For Marge and the kids
and Grampa

82
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:06,392
and the dog.

83
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,895
Don't you have a cat?

84
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,465
Screw the cat.

85
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:13,874
Kids?

86
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:15,377
Wake up.

87
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:19,051
I've got something
important to say.

88
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:21,255
Now, I've got a confession
to make.

89
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:25,430
Your father spent last night
in the drunk tank.

90
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:28,771
- Pay up, Lis.
- Oh, why do I keep betting on

91
00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:31,442
working late to pay
for my college?

92
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,413
Well, from now on,
put your money on

93
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,185
comes home
and sets a perfect example.

94
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:37,855
Good morning, Homer.

95
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:40,427
Young man, stand up
when a lady enters the room.

96
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,431
Especially a fine woman
like your ma.

97
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:43,867
You still pickled?

98
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,604
On your feet, boy!

99
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:48,476
Gee, thank you, Homie.

100
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,313
I'm a changed man, Marge.

101
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,384
Now, let us join hands
in prayer.

102
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,388
Are we gonna get food after?

103
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:56,392
- No.
- Did somebody croak?

104
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,396
- No.
- Did you buy a Powerball ticket?

105
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:01,503
I just want to say
a lousy prayer, okay?!

106
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:05,076
Lord, we humbly ask you
to bless this family

107
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:07,280
and keep us mindful
to care one for the other.

108
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:08,517
Amen.

109
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:10,053
Amen.

110
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,224
Sweetie, what's gotten into you?

111
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,929
I'm a new, better man,
thanks to Cletus.

112
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,633
You know what?

113
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,302
I believe you.

114
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,741
And that was that.

115
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:25,283
We ain't done.

116
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,053
We got two more acts.

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,124
And a whittled by credit.

118
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,144
Hi, Homie. Remember anything
from last night?

119
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:41,282
I remember I'm a better man.

120
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:43,119
It stuck!

121
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:46,158
I don't forget important things.

122
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:47,662
Where the hell's my car?

123
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:52,939
Just once, I wanted to feel
like a man who owned a car.

124
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:03,292
Marge, kids, this is the man
that turned me around.

125
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,963
What, this goober?

126
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,802
No, my wife's family is Goobers.

127
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,774
I come from a long line
of No-Accounts.

128
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:13,747
<i>I woke from my dreamin'</i>

129
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:16,285
<i>With my love, Brandine</i>

130
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,422
<i>The gal I got pregnant</i>

131
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:22,264
<i>When we was 16</i>

132
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,675
No one sweet-talks me
like you, goat lips.

133
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:34,656
Cletus, you changed my life.

134
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:37,561
How would you like for me
to change yours?

135
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:40,400
You ain't pitchin' me
on a pyramid scheme, is you?

136
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,905
'Cause if so, I'm in.

137
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:46,245
No, no, no. The world's got
to hear what you've got to say.

138
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,251
Well, I'll be daggadoobedubbit.

139
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:51,322
Why'd you bring me
to a parking lot?

140
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:53,492
Hey, if it's to find baby names,

141
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,535
I already gots Camry,
Festiva, Compact Only

142
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,237
and Denver Boot.

143
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:00,574
No, no, no.

144
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:04,448
We're gonna start
your singing career right here.

145
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:12,698
Singing career?

146
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,537
If you can reach an audience
the way you reached me...

147
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:17,340
Did you ever see A Star Is Born

148
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,344
with Bradley Cooper
and Lady Gaga?

149
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:20,085
No.

150
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,585
How about with Barbra Streisand
and Kris Kristofferson?

151
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,423
- No, sir.
- James Mason and Judy Garland?

152
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,530
Oh, no.
Just What Price Hollywood?

153
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:30,868
With Constance Bennett
and Lowell Sherman,

154
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:33,740
upon which A Star Is Born
is based.

155
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:36,946
Whatever.
I can make you a star.

156
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:38,583
My pappy's gon' manage you.

157
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,119
Whoa diggity!

158
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:43,292
Your future's brighter
than a polecat in a henhouse.

159
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,296
Hey, if you're
gonna speak hillbilly,

160
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:47,467
practice your enuncification.

161
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:51,408
Use your adverbs proper-like,
dad gummitly.

162
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,814
- Yes'm.
- We's powerful sorry.

163
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,653
Well, I do need to find a way
to make a living,

164
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:58,489
since Wiggum shut me down.

165
00:07:58,557 --> 00:08:01,328
And I swore I would
never go back to retail...

166
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:03,934
which means putting tails back
on animals.

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,104
You got any experience?

168
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:08,543
I once managed
a beautiful woman

169
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,547
who was not my wife.

170
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:12,618
It ended the way you'd expect.

171
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,354
12 gold records.

172
00:08:15,924 --> 00:08:18,128
But I promise I'll always
shoot straight with you,

173
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:20,132
unless we're actually using
real guns.

174
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,605
In which case I always
blast randomly in a circle.

175
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,140
Do we have a deal?

176
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:26,646
Whoa, not so fast there.

177
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:29,084
Show business has screwed up
a lot of country folk,

178
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,787
from Elvis to Britney.

179
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:32,156
And Mister Ed.

180
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:35,162
Did you know that he was
a heroin addict?

181
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:36,833
A horse on horse?

182
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,503
Of course, of course.

183
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,507
Look, I'll do the dirty work.

184
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:42,511
Now, here's
the standard contract.

185
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:46,619
Well, let me just give this
a quick gander.

186
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:47,821
Come here, gander.

187
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:51,228
Okay, yeah, all right.
We got a deal.

188
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:02,651
Homie, should our kids be here
this late?

189
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,421
I'm a family man now.

190
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:07,126
And a family man does things
with his family.

191
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:09,565
- I have math homework.
- Do it at the bar.

192
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,734
Okay, let's see.

193
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,573
I've got to draw
a perfect circle.

194
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,742
There you go.

195
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,278
Thank you.

196
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:17,815
Follow me, boys.

197
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,084
A-one and a-two,

198
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,488
and a-one and a-two and a...

199
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:24,996
Three? When did that happen?

200
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,641
<i>Out in the country</i>

201
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:32,511
<i>They ain't no nine-to-five</i>

202
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:34,314
<i>We don't get promoted</i>

203
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,151
<i>It's a fight to stay alive</i>

204
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:38,723
<i>We lean on our family</i>

205
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,794
<i>When times is gettin' hard</i>

206
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,865
<i>We're broke and we're dirty</i>

207
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,735
<i>And we ain't too smart</i>

208
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:46,739
<i>But hey, hey</i>

209
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:48,910
<i>Here's what I got to say</i>

210
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,881
<i>You can keep your mansions</i>

211
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:52,918
<i>And you can keep your yachts</i>

212
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:56,224
<i>I ain't needin' nothin'
'cept for everything I gots</i>

213
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,761
<i>And I thank the Lord
for that</i>

214
00:09:57,828 --> 00:09:59,264
That's me.

215
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,769
<i>When I count my blessings
every night</i>

216
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,940
<i>Got my wife and my kids
and a belly full of ribs</i>

217
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,744
<i>Lord up above
and a whole lot of love</i>

218
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:08,082
<i>Wife and my kids
and a belly full of ribs</i>

219
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:10,086
<i>And I thank the Lord above</i>

And send.

226
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:29,491
Ah, Elin,
I thought I'd find you dancing.

227
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:31,996
Yes, I'm exactly as I seem.

228
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,635
- Well, I...
- Quiet!

229
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,304
Someone's getting clicks.

230
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:39,344
Our next guest is
from America's heartland.

231
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,014
Up-bup-bup!

232
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,485
Not on my white furniture,
please.

233
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,374
Not loud enough!
Not loud enough!

234
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,844
Don't make me make you dance!

235
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,052
Get me a new audience.

236
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,968
Howdy do, Elin?

237
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,574
You sure do look different
in person than you do

238
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,744
in them Finding Nemo movies.

239
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:14,982
You know, Cletus,
I've heard your fans

240
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,986
will do anything you say.

241
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,957
Oh, that can't be true.

242
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,161
- Try it.
- Nah, go on.

243
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:23,098
It's my show. Do as I say.

244
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:26,772
Well, Elin, we got ourselves
a police chief

245
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,943
in our town
by the name of Wiggum.

246
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,448
Now, I ain't got nothing
agin him, mind you,

247
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:35,389
but if you is my fans, here's
what I want you to do to him.

248
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,698
Something is going on here.

249
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,468
Something weird.

250
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,007
Okay, help. Police!

251
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:46,979
Never a cop around
when you need one.

252
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:54,093
Well, I want to thank you,
my friend.

253
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,597
You changed my life.

254
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:58,235
I was nothing but a zero
when I met you,

255
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,774
but now I'm ten times that.

256
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,143
Come here, you.

257
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:08,957
Homer, stand up.

258
00:12:10,593 --> 00:12:13,031
I want you to know
that I'm firing you

259
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:15,469
and I'm replacing you
with a professional.

260
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,808
Aw, nothing ever good happens
when you talk

261
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:20,112
to the person sitting
next to you on an airplane.

262
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:26,759
Homer, this here is a feller

263
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:29,330
what wants to be my new manager.

264
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:31,736
- And you're letting him?
- Yeah, I don't know why.

265
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:34,407
There's just, there's something
about him, you know?

266
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:37,013
Cletus, Cletus.

267
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,950
Listen to how I say this.

268
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:41,922
It's something everyone says,
but when I say it,

269
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:46,297
you will never hear it like this
as long as you live.

270
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:48,301
I make it very special.

271
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,404
How are you?

272
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,809
Ooh, I just got goose bumps.

273
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,245
Say it again.

274
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,817
No. Listen to me. I love you.

275
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,754
I am in love with you.
This is real.

276
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:00,225
Once you sign with me,
you can call me up at 3:00

277
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:02,063
in the morning, I won't be mad.

278
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:04,768
I'll say, what's wrong, boobie?
I love you.

279
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:07,908
I can't believe you're thinking
of signing with him.

280
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:10,747
The way you changed my life
when we were in jail?

281
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,216
That means nothing to you?

282
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:15,222
My friend, what happens in jail
stays in jail.

283
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,892
Unless it's breaking
out of jail.

284
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,197
Well, all I have to offer
is my friendship

285
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:21,802
and the fact that you wouldn't
be here if not for me.

286
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,207
That's your closer?
That's pitiful.

287
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:25,810
I don't love you.

288
00:13:25,877 --> 00:13:28,115
Here's my closer.
Spuckman!

289
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:29,317
Duffman?

290
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:30,820
Now I'm Spuckman.

291
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:34,093
Because Duff replaced me
with a hard-partying cat.

292
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,830
Me-ow!

293
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:38,168
Clifford, we're gonna
market your dreck

294
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,141
as Spuckler Family Moonshine,
internationally.

295
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,744
We'll say it's made by people

296
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:46,351
who actually wash their hands
voluntarily,

297
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,188
not 'cause of some sign.

298
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:51,294
Hey, man, mine's all brewed
from pure mountain water

299
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:53,699
from out behind
the DuPont factory.

300
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,603
I'm going to assume
that's a joke.

301
00:13:57,072 --> 00:13:58,709
But fun's for another time.

302
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:01,347
We're gonna make you bigger
than Campbell's Soup.

303
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:04,287
Not tomato or chicken noodle.
That would be impossible.

304
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:06,592
But there's one of them
where they put in potatoes.

305
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,161
We'll make you bigger than that.

306
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:10,633
Now, why don't you pick
one of these Hollywood actresses

307
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,469
to play your wife
in the commercial?

308
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:14,173
Anyone you want. Just pick.

309
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,444
Oh, I like this one.

310
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:18,148
Oh, she'll never work with you.

311
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:19,283
Pick an ugly one.

312
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,087
Well, what about Brandine?

313
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:23,458
Aw, she'll always be
my first love

314
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:25,863
and second cousin.

315
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,034
Well, this was
a very good meeting.

316
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,038
And welcome to UPM.

317
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:32,376
Here's a blank page, sign it.

318
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:34,146
We'll fill in the rest.

319
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:36,017
Give me a hug.

320
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,887
No, that's not a hug.

321
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:39,691
A Hollywood hug.

322
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:42,530
Get him off. Get him off!

323
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:46,972
And now your picture goes up
on our wall of fame.

324
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,247
Bert and Ernie? I don't even
think they're living.

325
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:53,719
Hey, IMDb Bert and Ernie,
will you?

326
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:55,322
Do puppets die?

327
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,259
Hey, why does the Pope have
no merchandise?

328
00:14:57,326 --> 00:14:59,898
Can't we come up with a little
doohickey you put on your desk

329
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,737
that blows a colored smoke when
you're picked for something?

330
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,977
Everything he taught me
was a lie.

331
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:08,683
Maybe, but think
what you became.

332
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:10,352
A better husband.

333
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:11,855
A better father.

334
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:13,659
You can still be one.

335
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:14,828
Nah.

336
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:17,834
Why are my eyes burnin'?

337
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:19,705
I'm just whippin' up
another batch

338
00:15:19,771 --> 00:15:21,842
of my homemade family brew.

339
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:25,817
Let my longtime corporate
mascot tell you all about it.

340
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,154
Spuckler Family Moonshine.

341
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:30,927
Lovingly distilled
in the heart of America.

342
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:33,365
Spuckler Family Moonshine
is distilled in Finland.

343
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,670
Not a single American
was employed in its manufacture.

344
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:43,552
You have to help him
get back to his family.

345
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:46,892
Forget it. I'm through with
those slack-jawed, no-account...

346
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,401
examples of America
at its finest.

347
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,471
He was a great man
until you ruint him.

348
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:55,710
With your promises
of short underwear

349
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,413
and professional haircuts.

350
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,551
You think you can play God,

351
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:01,889
wreck my life,
and then just walk away?

352
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,661
First of all,
I wasn't playing God.

353
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:06,732
I was doing
an original character.

354
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,036
Don't worry, we'll fix this.

355
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:11,174
I don't know how, but we will.

356
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,413
Unless Homer decides to
disregard my wishes completely.

357
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,520
Don't take time!

358
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:19,423
All right.

359
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,076
What the...?
I thought we was quits.

360
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:31,280
Listen, pal,
you've ruined your life.

361
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:34,086
You haven't just watched A Star
Is Born, you're living it.

362
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:36,592
No, man.
A Star Is Born is about

363
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:39,129
a star who fades
and then kills hisself.

364
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:41,467
This here is much more like

365
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:44,273
a nice guy
who's seduced by power,

366
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,412
as in Elia Kazan's
A Face in the Crowd.

367
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,149
Dang, that's a good'un.

368
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,487
How do you know
so much about movies?

369
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,959
Oh, well,
Brandine and I once squatted

370
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:56,330
inside an abandoned Blockbuster.

371
00:16:56,397 --> 00:17:00,673
That's where we conceived
our twins, Be Kind and Rewind.

372
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,446
Forget that. You got to go
back home where you belong.

373
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:06,785
Also, you owe me $27,000.

374
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:10,125
Yeah, I'm afraid I donated that
to a children's hospital.

375
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:11,795
You monster!

376
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:14,066
Look, Cletus, this isn't you.

377
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,803
What about your family?

378
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,174
Well, my family now is
Carrie Underwood,

379
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:21,080
Taylor Swift
and all of them Mumfords.

380
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:24,788
And everyone in BTS,
except for Jungkook.

381
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:27,994
He's too pretty for my tastes.

382
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:30,098
Cletus,
just answer me one thing.

383
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:33,606
After a long day of yokeling,
don't you miss coming home

384
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:36,979
to a woman who thinks you're
the most important thing on...

385
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:38,782
God's green Earth?

386
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:42,590
Well, now that
you mention it.

387
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:52,009
<i>Then sit by my side</i>

388
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:54,480
<i>If you love me...</i>

389
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:57,754
No, no, no, no, no more singin'!

390
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,824
Not even talk singin'!

391
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:01,828
Which is hardly singin' at all,

392
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:05,001
Mr. Lin-Manuel Miranda.

393
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:07,840
Oh, Gummy Sue...

394
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:11,480
Jitney, Uber Black,
Normal Head Joe,

395
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,986
Disney Plus, oh, HBO Max,

396
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:16,057
CBS All Access!

397
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:20,198
Oh, man, they's all
so beautiful.

398
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,404
I'm goin' back to my family!

399
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:25,576
Cancel my tour dates!

400
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:27,379
Burn my masters!

401
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:29,517
Whoa, let's not get crazy.

402
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:31,253
You saved my life, Homer.

403
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,661
And then you ruined it,
and then you saved it again.

404
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:37,934
And for that,
I am forever neutral.

405
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:41,541
Listen to how I say this.

406
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:43,612
It's something everybody says,

407
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,950
but I say it better
than anybody else.

408
00:18:46,016 --> 00:18:47,452
How are you?

409
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,423
Well, I don't...

410
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,060
Don't talk. Just listen.

411
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,632
You're gonna be a brand.

412
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,303
I want to tell your stories.
Tell me your story.

413
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,274
Not the person they see
on the court.

414
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:01,313
Well, my family didn't have
much money, and Daddy used to...

415
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,317
That is so relatable.

416
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:04,854
Not to me. I'm rich.

417
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,492
But, God, I always wanted
to live in poverty.

418
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,666
Now, all I ask is 15%
of your earnings for life.

419
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,004
Not your whole life.
After 80, it's all yours.

420
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,243
And when you retire, you're
gonna get a Netflix special.

421
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,582
Actually, everybody gets
a Netflix special.

422
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,018
Why do they even call them that?

423
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,189
They should call them
Netflix normals.

424
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:24,694
You want a Netflix normal?
We'll get it for you.

425
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,567
You want the Obamas to produce?
You got it.

426
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,871
Not Barack or Michelle,
that's impossible.

427
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:32,409
Check on Malia, please!

428
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:34,213
Malia.

429
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,916
No, it's not a country!

430
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:39,156
Can I just say...?

431
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:40,826
You don't have to talk.

432
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:43,999
Not unless you're getting paid
a million dollars a word.

433
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,671
And some of those words
can be a or the.

434
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:49,109
Listen, never say won't again.

435
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:52,182
Say will not.
'Cause that's $2 million.

436
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:54,152
That's a Bentley.

437
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:56,357
Have you ever been interested
in a roofing company?

438
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:57,860
You're very tall.

439
00:19:57,927 --> 00:19:59,864
You're much closer to roofs
than most people.

440
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:01,534
How about this?

441
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,872
I can book you as a freak
in a monster movie.

442
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:07,245
Or a dinosaur. You're as big
as a small dinosaur.

443
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,719
We're trying to develop
an animated musical

444
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:13,792
about the dinosaurs
that survived the comet.

445
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,629
You could play a small dinosaur.

446
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:17,232
You jump out from a tree.

447
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,802
You sing a song.

448
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:20,204
We've already got one written.

449
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:22,042
It's called I'm Still Here.

450
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:24,046
Am I, am I reaching you?

451
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:25,281
Just sign already.

452
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:35,335
Okay. Looking for the next
musical superstar here.

453
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,771
Barney,

454
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:40,278
see what you can do
with this piccolo.

455
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:44,887
Lady, you look like
a cellist to me.

456
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:48,461
Forget that.

457
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:49,964
Jailbird, what about you?

458
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:52,937
I play the hacksaw.

459
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:54,707
Hacksaw. Hacksaw.

460
00:20:54,774 --> 00:20:57,813
- Ah, here you go.
- All right!

461
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,222
My first number is
We've Gotta Get Out of This Place.

462
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:05,495
I love it! Let me hear
that sweet, sweet sound.

463
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,273
Ah, that is some
beautiful hacksawing.

464
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,277
Ah, yeah.

465
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,248
Soothing.

466
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:18,120
Soon, I'm gonna be doing
some sawing myself.

467
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:20,124
Ah, yeah.

468
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:22,028
Oh, yeah.
