1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,330
"Wet cement."

3
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,458
Is there any sweeter sign?

4
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,751
Well, maybe "high voltage."

5
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,174
Hello, son.

6
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,509
You want to try this flying
motorcycle I just invented?

7
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,510
No time.

8
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,720
Okay.

9
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,641
This is for the ages.

10
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:05,106
Like Stonehenge, this site
will forever be a mystery.

11
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,691
Who was Bart

12
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,819
and how did he manage to write
his name in solid cement?

13
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,237
He must have been
much smarter

14
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,321
than his sister Lisa

15
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,490
about whom
we know nothing.

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,949
Say, let's bring him
back to life

17
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,242
by using technology.

18
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,119
Ay, caramba!

19
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,922
What's normal to him,
amazes us.

20
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,340
He will be our new god.

21
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,431
Oh, good. Somebody's shadow.

22
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,308
I'll just turn
and brag about my work.

23
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,392
Yi-ii!

24
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,852
Bart,

25
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,687
you've graffito-tagged
public property.

26
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,606
It was an accident.

27
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,849
I can't believe you vandalized
your own hometown, Bart.

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,236
What would
Jebediah Springfield say?

29
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,946
I think he'd be cool with it.

30
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,074
Homer, will you please help me
make a big deal of this?

31
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,118
What for?
Nobody cared when Bogart

32
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,328
defaced that sidewalk
in Hollywood.

33
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,456
Well, I'm just shocked
by this whole family.

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,042
Whatever happened to good,
old-fashioned town pride?

35
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,394
It's been going downhill
ever since

36
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,670
the lake caught fire.

37
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,964
Now just a darned minute.

38
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,675
This town is a part
of who you are.

39
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,636
This is a Springfield
Isotopes cap.

40
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,846
When you wear it,

41
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,764
you're wearing
Springfield.

42
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,683
When you eat a fish
from our river,

43
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,852
you're eating Springfield.

44
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,563
When you make lemonade
from our trees,

45
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,731
you're drinking Springfield.

46
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,026
Mom, when you give that lecture,
you're boring Springfield.

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,528
Bart, you have roots
in this town,

48
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,113
and you ought to show
respect for it.

49
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,739
This town is a part of us all.

50
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,576
A part of us all,
a part of us all.

51
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,036
Sorry to repeat myself,
but it'll help you remember.

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,874
This town is a part of us all.

53
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,167
A part of us all.

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,585
A part of us all.

55
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,878
Wow. That does work.

56
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,800
Hey, gonna win some
this season?

57
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,594
Gonna try.

58
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,643
When it comes to catching trout,

59
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,354
nothing beats
the German light infantry.

60
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,647
Beautiful,
aren't they?

61
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,192
Yep. I'm going
to huck them at cars.

62
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,408
Hey, Milhouse, how's
the lemonade business?

63
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,243
It's clearly booming,
Bart.

64
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,663
I don't even want any.

65
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,832
I just bought a pity glass.

66
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,500
We've squozen
our whole supply.

67
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,919
To the lemon tree!

68
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,641
Thar she grows.

69
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,021
You know Milhouse,
I've been thinking.

70
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,689
This town ain't so bad.

71
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,483
Good friends,
lots of lemons,

72
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,193
numerous
angel sightings.

73
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,778
When you get
right down to it,

74
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,489
Springfield's a pretty
cool place to live.

75
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,074
Springfield sucks!

76
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,620
Hey, stop talking bad
about my town, man.

77
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,746
Why don't you make me?

78
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,206
I don't make trash.
I burn it.

79
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,041
Then I guess
you're a garbage man.

80
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,793
I know you are,
but what am I?

81
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,919
A garbage man.

82
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,587
I know you are,
but what am I?

83
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,713
A garbage man.

84
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,382
I know you are,
but what am I?

85
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,591
A garbage man.

86
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,676
Takes one
to know one.

87
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,387
Checkmate.

88
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,223
Hey, kid, stop wearing
your backpack over one shoulder.

89
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,474
We invented that.

90
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,227
- Copycats.
- Ah, you copied us.

91
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,979
Step over this line
and say that.

92
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,981
I'll kick your butt...

93
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,064
at Nintendo.

94
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,568
I just put a rock
in your crummy town.

95
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,569
That's a crud rock.

96
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,530
It belongs in crud town.

97
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,161
Look at the weak,
little baby.

98
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,248
You're stupid,
you stupid, weak baby.

99
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,500
Come on, let's
get out of here.

100
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,602
Hey, they're taking our lemons!

101
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,837
We can't spare a single one.

102
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,469
You just got citric acid
in my eye.

103
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,389
You'll pay for that,
Springfield.

104
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,935
Ah, some things
never change.

105
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,354
Hey, everybody,
an old man's talking.

106
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,692
Grampa's the name.

107
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:22,447
Did you know this tree
dates back to frontier times?

108
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,949
Wow! Frontier times!

109
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,492
Shut up!

110
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,454
It all began when
Jebediah Springfield

111
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,080
first came to these lands

112
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,501
with his partner,
Shelbyville Manhattan.

113
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,884
People,
our search is over.

114
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,136
On this site, we
shall build a new town

115
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,972
where we can worship freely,
govern justly,

116
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,351
and grow vast fields of hemp
for making rope and blankets.

117
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,603
Yes, and marry
our cousins.

118
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,021
I was just...

119
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,373
What are you talking
about, Shelbyville?

120
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,358
Why would we want
to marry our cousins?

121
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,151
'Cause they're
so attractive.

122
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,487
I thought that was the whole point
of this journey.

123
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,863
Absolutely not.

124
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,074
I tell you,
I won't live in a town

125
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,368
that robs men of the right
to marry their cousins.

126
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,037
Well, then,
we'll form our own town.

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,874
Who will come and live a life
devoted to chastity, abstinence,

128
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,877
and a flavorless mush
I call rootmarm?

129
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,432
The town of Springfield
was born on that day.

130
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,559
And to mark
that sweet moment,

131
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,896
our people planted
this lemon tree...

132
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,400
Lemons being the sweetest fruit
available at the time.

133
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,864
Those Shelbyville kids
think they're so hot.

134
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,449
But you know what?
They're not.

135
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,201
I really agree with you
on this one, Bart.

136
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,619
Class, please.

137
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,746
If you don't learn
Roman numerals,

138
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,039
you'll never know the dates

139
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,141
certain motion pictures
were copyrighted.

140
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,625
Everybody come quick!

141
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,186
Something's happened,
no time to explain.

142
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,462
No, children, no.

143
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,297
Your education is important.

144
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,967
Roman numerals,
et cetera, whatever.

145
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,051
I tried.

146
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,500
Are you sure
it wouldn't be faster

147
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,975
to just tell us
what happened?

148
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,060
No. I said there's
no time to explain,

149
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,478
and I stick by that.

150
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,358
The lemon tree's gone.

151
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,486
And the tracks appear
to lead into Shelbyville.

152
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,114
Oh, look, a clue.
A candy bar wrapper.

153
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,409
They're always eating
candy in Shelbyville.

154
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,619
They love the sweet taste.

155
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,246
We got to get
that tree back.

156
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,457
You mean,
go into Shelbyville?

157
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,959
We'll never make it out alive.

158
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,836
That lemon tree
is a part of our town,

159
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,088
and as kids,
the backbone of our economy.

160
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,423
We'll get it back

161
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,508
or choke their rivers
with our dead.

162
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,305
Where you going, Bart?

163
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,366
Mom, you won't believe this,
but something you said

164
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,910
the other day really got
through to me.

165
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,229
And now, I am going
to teach some kids

166
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,564
a lesson.

167
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,649
I choose
to take that literally.

168
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,234
Death to Shelbyville!

169
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,487
Yes, Bart's a tutor now.

170
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,905
Tute on, son!

171
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,740
Tute on!

172
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,162
Hey, Milhouse,

173
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,955
get your invasion supplies
and let's go!

174
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,342
- What the...
- Where'd he go?

175
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,302
Over here,
my friends.

176
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,554
Or is it
over here?

177
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,018
Yeah!

178
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,771
Okay, here's
how it goes.

179
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,854
I'm the leader,

180
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,398
Milhouse is my
loyal sidekick,

181
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,692
Nelson's the tough guy,
Martin's the smart guy,

182
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,836
and Todd's the quiet,
religious guy

183
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,903
who ends up
going crazy.

184
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,364
And now,
the time has come

185
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,450
to cross this line
into mystery and danger.

186
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,037
To step out of childhood
and become men.

187
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,135
If you get lost,
remember,

188
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,223
you can always find east by
staring directly at the sun.

189
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,349
Here's a tip.

190
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,184
Put a pinch of sage
in your boots

191
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,271
and all day long,
a spicy scent is your reward.

192
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
Oh, my gosh! Look!

193
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,111
The fire hydrants here
are yellow!

194
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,655
This place is starting
to freak me out.

195
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,948
Danger coming!

196
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,658
Behind us!

197
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,120
What is it, boy?

198
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,455
Is there something behind that wall
we should beat up?

199
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,748
No time to
check it out now.

200
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,500
We've got
lemonade to sell.

201
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,379
Huh. Radical.

202
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,215
They're getting
rich off us.

203
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,259
And that kid with the backpack
said radical.

204
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,219
I say radical.

205
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,346
That's my thing that I say!

206
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,307
I feel like I'm
gonna explode here!

207
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,520
It's almost lunchtime.

208
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,081
Do you know where
your brother is tutoring?

209
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,399
Tutoring? The only
thing Bart's teaching

210
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,610
is guerilla combat
in Shelbyville.

211
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,546
Well, do you have a number
where we can reach him?

212
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,822
No. Mom, Bart and some kids
ran off

213
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,407
to wage war on Shelbyville.

214
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,410
Homer! Come quick!

215
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,162
Bart's quit his tutoring job

216
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,747
and joined a violence gang!

217
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,251
Uh, the trail
has become indistinct.

218
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,545
Uh, I suggest we split up

219
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,880
to cover more ground.

220
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,465
Good idea.
Milhouse, you and me

221
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,883
will be Omega team.

222
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,594
Todd, you and Data
are team Strike Force.

223
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,179
Nelson, that leaves
you and Martin.

224
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,181
Team Discovery Channel!

225
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,935
Your wussiness
better come in handy.

226
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,524
I want some answers,
damn it!

227
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,026
Okay, folks, look,

228
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,070
I called the police captain
in Shelbyville.

229
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,571
He says he hasn't
seen our kids,

230
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,673
but if they show up
in the morgue,

231
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,199
he's gonna fax us.

232
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,826
Oh, man, I hate those
Shelbyville jerks.

233
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,079
Honey, I was born
in Shelbyville.

234
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,914
And it tears
me up inside.

235
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,248
This is my fault.

236
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,751
I tried to teach Bart
about town pride,

237
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,960
but the power
of my words

238
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,879
filled him with
a sort of madness.

239
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,341
Now, Marge, you can't blame
all of Bart's problems

240
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,426
on your one
little speech.

241
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,095
If anything
turned him bad

242
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,389
it's that time you let
him wear a bathing suit

243
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,723
instead of underwear.

244
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,601
And let's not forget
your little speech.

245
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,561
Isn't there anything
we can do?

246
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,896
Yes, there is!

247
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,398
Come on, everybody.

248
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,732
Let's go into Shelbyville

249
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,151
and get those kids
back ourselves.

250
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,903
I got an R.V.
We can use...

251
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,572
Flanders's!

252
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,950
Well, okay, but, you know,
just go a little bit easy...

253
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,494
Pile in, everybody!
No time to wipe your feet.

254
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,626
Okay, piglet,
start squealing.

255
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,627
Where did you
get the lemons

256
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,837
for this lemonade?

257
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,922
Uh, this is Country Time
lemonade mix.

258
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,549
There's never been
anything

259
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,592
close to a lemon
in it, I swear.

260
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,554
Hey, nobody hassles
my little brother.

261
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,181
Hey, no one manhandles
the bosom chum

262
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,558
of Nelson Muntz.

263
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,351
Spring forth,
burly protector

264
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,686
and save me!

265
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,525
Aw, geez.

266
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,444
I never hang out
with him... normally.

267
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,740
Hark to the tale
of Nelson.

268
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,576
And the boy
he loved so dear.

269
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,119
They remained
the best of friends.

270
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,912
For years
and years and years.

271
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,748
What are they saying?

272
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,082
Uh, I'm not sure.

273
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,001
I thought you said
you could read lips.

274
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,586
I assumed I could.

275
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,962
Aw, it's no use,
Milhouse.

276
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,589
If we're going to find
that lemon tree,

277
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,965
I've got
to go undercover.

278
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,384
What I need
is a new face.

279
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,595
You leave that
to the Baron and me.

280
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,933
Hello there,
fellow Shelbyvillians.

281
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,185
Wait a minute.

282
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,811
If you're from
Shelbyville,

283
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,189
how come we've never
seen you at school?

284
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,273
I don't go
to school.

285
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,734
Okay, what's
two plus two?

286
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,778
- Five.
- Story checks out.

287
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,198
We just got word there's
Springfield kids in town.

288
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,493
Curse those
handsome devils.

289
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,161
We're going up
to the bluffs

290
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,004
to paint "Springfield sucks"
in huge letters.

291
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,457
That way, whenever they
look into Shelbyville,

292
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,125
they will realize
that they suck.

293
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,418
Oh, radical.

294
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,796
Quit copying me!

295
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,422
You know, I wish

296
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,134
there was a Springfield
kid here right now.

297
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,969
I'd fill his mouth
with stink bugs!

298
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,971
No, not in my mouth!

299
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,807
...is what
the kid would say.

300
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,058
To the bluffs!

301
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,605
Well, a friendly Springfield
hello there, neighbors.

302
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,565
You know, we think
some kids of ours

303
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,275
may be missing
in your town.

304
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,485
Missing children?

305
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,070
Sounds like
Springfield's

306
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,613
got a discipline
problem.

307
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,448
Maybe that's why we
beat them at football

308
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,741
nearly half
the time, huh?

309
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,870
Quit stalling, kid.

310
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,289
Write "Springfield sucks"
in giant letters.

311
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,843
His can control
is excellent.

312
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,136
Yes. And that wig
makes him look

313
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,847
a lot like one
of the Beatles.

314
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,559
That's right!

315
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,102
The stranger
who walks amongst you

316
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,229
is me, Bart Simpson!

317
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,190
You know, Bart Simpson.

318
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,776
From Springfield?

319
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,861
He's from Springfield!

320
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,070
Get him!

321
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,544
I'll use these spray cans
as jet packs and fly to safety.

322
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,212
So long, losers!

323
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,011
You're dead.

324
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,512
Uh, hey, look!

325
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,889
Someone's attractive cousin.

326
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,307
Huh? Where?

327
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,357
So, he thinks he can
out-skateboard me, huh?

328
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,026
Launch me, boys.

329
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,055
Slow down, you sidewalk-surfing
cube-gleamers!

330
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,021
Wet cement.

331
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,238
I could sure use
that flying motorcycle now.

332
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,698
You had your chance.

333
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,629
Safe at last.

334
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,305
"Caution: Exit
through door seven only.

335
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,682
"All other rooms contain

336
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,392
man-eating tigers"?!

337
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,896
Roman numerals.

338
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,900
They never even tried
to teach us that in school.

339
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,944
Milhouse, what's seven
in Roman numerals?

340
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,445
I'll tell you, Bart,

341
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,489
but really you should end
each transmission

342
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,700
with the word
"over." Over.

343
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,035
Correction: The only
thing that's over

344
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,662
is that transmission.

345
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,415
Is this the untimely end
of Milhouse?

346
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,709
But Milhouse is my name.

347
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,044
But I thought
I was the only one.

348
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,755
A pain I know
all too well.

349
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,175
So, this is what
it feels like

350
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,969
when doves cry.

351
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,178
Milhouse? Milhouse?

352
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,555
Now what do I do?

353
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,558
Wait. I got it.

354
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,476
I got it!

355
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,477
I don't got it.

356
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,104
Okay. Think, Bart.

357
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,523
Where have you seen
Roman numerals before?

358
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,649
I know.

359
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,359
"Rocky V."
That was the fifth one.

360
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,530
So, "Rocky V" plus
"Rocky II" equals...

361
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,490
"Rocky VII"!
Adrian's revenge!

362
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,331
Oh, it's no use.

363
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,333
I'm never gonna find that tree.

364
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,170
This whole raid was
as useless as that yellow,

365
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,006
lemon-shaped rock over there.

366
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,466
Wait a minute.

367
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,009
There's a lemon
behind that rock.

368
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,387
The tree!

369
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,567
Oh! A car impound lot.

370
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,862
The impenetrable
fortress of suburbia.

371
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,198
We'll never get
the tree back now.

372
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,574
Keep your voices
down, boys.

373
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,093
We didn't come this far
to get found out.

374
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,035
Found 'em!

375
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,578
You kids are in big trouble.

376
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,288
Running away from home
like this.

377
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,956
But they stole our lemon tree.

378
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,334
I don't care
what excuse you've got.

379
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,295
Nothing's going to stop me
in the middle of this speech.

380
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,380
You're gonna... lemon tree!

381
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,801
That tree's
been in Springfield

382
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,469
since the time
of our forefathers.

383
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,139
Give it back, or we'll
bust in there and take it.

384
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,141
Bust in here and take it?

385
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,060
You must be stupider
than you look.

386
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,479
Stupider like a fox!

387
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,070
I'm okay.

388
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,535
Don't you get it, Springfield?

389
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,370
It's over.
You lose.

390
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,663
Now, if you'll excuse me,

391
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,498
all this talk
has made me hungry.

392
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,633
This is the darkest day

393
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,176
in the history
of Springfield.

394
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,554
If anybody wants me,
I'll be in the shower.

395
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,349
There's got to be a way
to get that tree back.

396
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,350
Hey, look!

397
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,434
A hospital.

398
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,103
Pull in there.

399
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,107
Oh, great.
Now I'm upside down.

400
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,362
Oh, dear.

401
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,506
Some thoughtless human being

402
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,198
has parked in a hospital zone.

403
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,994
And I think to myself.

404
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,453
What a wonderful world.

405
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,592
No one in history

406
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,886
has ever done
anything this clever.

407
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,266
I'll get the gate.

408
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,189
That's okay, son.

409
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,732
I'll take care of him.

410
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,694
Faster, son.

411
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,529
He's got a taste
for meat now.

412
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,164
Get out here, son.

413
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,957
There's a-doin's
a-transpirin'.

414
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,500
Let's shut the gate
and seal them in.

415
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,295
Gun it, Flanders.

416
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,631
It won't start.

417
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,216
Something's draining
the battery.

418
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,302
Sorry.

419
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,767
We made it.

420
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,893
Whoo-hoo!

421
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,479
Eat my shorts,
Shelbyville.

422
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,940
Eat my shorts.

423
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,192
Yes, eat all of our shirts.

424
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,736
Ooh, you lousy
Springfielders.

425
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,029
Shake harder, boy.

426
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,407
We did it.

427
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,992
All right!

428
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,834
And with that,

429
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,630
a mighty cheer went up from
the heroes of Springfield.

430
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,092
They had brought the sacred tree
back to its native soil.

431
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,053
And though Flanders
was stuck with the impound fee,

432
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,223
he could easily afford it.

433
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,641
More lemonade, Bart?

434
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,184
Absolutely.

435
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,437
Say when.

436
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,583
There are over 14 parts
of the lemon that are edible...

437
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,234
...and with that,

438
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,570
a mighty cheer went up from
the heroes of Shelbyville.

439
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:24,074
They had banished
the awful lemon tree forever

440
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,784
because it was haunted.

441
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,577
Now, let's all celebrate

442
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,998
with a cool glass
of turnip juice.
