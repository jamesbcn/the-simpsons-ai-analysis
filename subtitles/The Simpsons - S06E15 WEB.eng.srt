1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,755
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,554
When Krusty wants to,
he can still blow them away.

3
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,765
Yes, he can take a simple,
everyday thing

4
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,892
like eating a bicycle
and make it funny.

5
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,936
See you tomorrow, kids.

6
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,814
But before I go,
I'd just like to say...

7
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,910
Ah, there's nothing better
than a cigarette,

8
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,153
unless it's a cigarette
lit with a hundred-dollar bill.

9
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,082
Put 5,000 bucks on the Lakers.

10
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,893
Hire Kenny G. To play
for me in the elevator.

11
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,397
My house is dirty,
buy me a clean one.

12
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,880
Krusty, as your accountant,
I must warn you...

13
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,424
Did you send those 1,000 roses
to Bea Arthur's grave?

14
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,884
Yes, but she's still...

15
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,886
I don't want to hear
the end of any sentences.

16
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,054
George Carlin on three.

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,889
Yeah? Lawsuit?

18
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,390
Oh, come on.

19
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,993
My "Seven words you can't
say on TV" bit

20
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,644
was entirely different

21
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,396
from your "Seven words you can't
say on TV" bit.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,856
So I'm a thief, am I?

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,443
Well, excuse me!

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,861
Give him ten grand.

25
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,946
Steve Martin on four.

26
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,614
Ten grand.

27
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,449
Krusty, in regards

28
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,410
to the large wager you made
on yesterday's horse race.

29
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,955
Oh, come on, how about letting
me go double or nothing

30
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,248
on the big opera tonight.

31
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,958
- Who do you like?
- The tenor.

32
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,960
Okay,

33
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,545
but we're only
letting the bet ride

34
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,506
because you crack us
so consistently up.

35
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,969
You've got to stop blowing
your money like this, Krusty.

36
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,052
No can do.

37
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,850
And those ridiculous
bets you make.

38
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,935
Gambling is the finest thing
a person can do

39
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,311
if he's good at it.

40
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,915
But you haven't won anything
in months.

41
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,857
So I'll just make
some more money.

42
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,608
Crank out some
cheesy merchandise.

43
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,372
But you've already
merchandized everything.

44
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,820
Krusty's Monopoly game.

45
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,905
The Krusty crowd control
barrier.

46
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,157
Nothing is selling anymore.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,367
Not even your new
Lady Krusty line.

48
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,828
But our infomercials
are running 24 hours a day.

49
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,956
So what do you think

50
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,917
of the Lady Krusty moustache
removal system now, Angelique?

51
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,378
It's Krusteriffic,
Johnny Unitas.

52
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,881
But is my upper lip
supposed to bleed like this?

53
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,507
Probably.

54
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,509
At this rate,
you'll be broke in a month.

55
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,970
The only thing left to do
is to open a clown college

56
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,847
and train some
regional Krusties.

57
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,474
You mean like that bozo,
Bonko the Clown?

58
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,310
- Exactly.
- Forget it.

59
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,937
I'll just cut back
on the condor egg omelets.

60
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,857
Mmm, a couple of those
would be tasty right now.

61
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,180
I'll found
the college tomorrow.

62
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,326
It must be
the first of the month.

63
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,869
New billboard day!

64
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,959
Finders keepers.

65
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,883
"This year, give her
English muffins."

66
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,801
Whatever you say,
Mr. Billboard.

67
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,725
"Best in the West."

68
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,894
That rhymes.

69
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,941
Clown college?

70
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,734
You can't eat that.

71
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,863
Well, I got everything
I was supposed to get.

72
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,491
I'm not going to enroll
in that clown college, though.

73
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,453
That advertisement
had no effect on me whatsoever.

74
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,341
Hey, Homer, the section

75
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,144
you're supposed
to be monitoring is on fire.

76
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,896
Clowns are funny.

77
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,324
Mom?

78
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,076
I think I'll have
some wine.

79
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,167
Marge...

80
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,252
Yes, Homey?

81
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,463
That's it.

82
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,941
You people have stood
in my way long enough.

83
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,634
I'm going to clown college.

84
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,680
I don't think any of us
expected him to say that.

85
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,266
Hurry up.

86
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,851
It's my first day
of clown college.

87
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,061
Hold still, Homer.
Don't squirm.

88
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,273
I am holding still.
I am squirming.

89
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,984
Dad, you can't just go around
pretending to be Krusty.

90
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:18,985
It's sacrilege.

91
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,278
He's a one and only.

92
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,988
I mean, he invented
the pie fight,

93
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,906
the pratfall,
and the seltzer bottle.

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,074
As far as I know.

95
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,701
Yeah, Dad, it was
bad enough

96
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,429
when you tried to pass
yourself off as Tom Bosley.

97
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,121
But Krusty?

98
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,749
You weren't complaining
when I got you this close

99
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,500
to Chachi.

100
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,169
What's a Chachi?

101
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,551
All right. There can only be
one Krusty in each territory,

102
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,762
so I hope this works out.

103
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,180
Tell me where you're from.

104
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,639
- Georgia.
- Texas.

105
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,017
Uh, Brooklyn.

106
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,018
Russia.

107
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,019
New Hampshire.

108
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,354
Homer.

109
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,189
Okay, we'll start
off with the baggy...

110
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,357
What?

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,876
Those are supposed
to be baggy pants.

112
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,234
Baggy!

113
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,237
Ooh, I've never had
a pair of pants

114
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,490
that fit this well
in my life.

115
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,993
Okay, memorize these
funny place names.

116
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,087
Stop it, you're killing me!

117
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,214
Seattle!

118
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,263
And now, everybody's favorite:

119
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,141
The Spin Cycle
Fantastique trick.

120
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,394
It's a great piece of buffoonery
if you pull it off.

121
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,605
But if you blow it,
you'll look like a fool.

122
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,110
Steady...

123
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,193
Steady.

124
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,074
Now, when the wealthy
dowager comes in,

125
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,617
the party's over, right?

126
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,868
Wrong!

127
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,789
Kill wealthy dowager.

128
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,881
Uh, burn that seat.

129
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,717
These Krusty brand balloons
are three bucks each.

130
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,970
But get a cheap one
and what happens?

131
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,098
Goes off, takes out the eyeballs
of every kid in the room.

132
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,975
What's that gonna cost you?

133
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,435
Hey, Bill, what did
that cost us?

134
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,293
Wow! I'm sorry I doubted
you before, Dad.

135
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,919
If there has to be

136
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,897
a bastardized version of Krusty,
I'm glad it's you.

137
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,673
Thanks, honey. Bank shot.

138
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,883
Wow!

139
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,551
That's good aim, Dad.

140
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,386
Well, it was my major.

141
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,265
Welcome to the noble family
of skilled Krustaceans.

142
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,851
You will now go back
to your hometowns

143
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,353
and do kids' parties,
swap meets,

144
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,355
and all the other piddling crap

145
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,233
I wouldn't touch
with a ten-foot clown pole.

146
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,235
Now come and get
your cat skins...

147
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,237
Uh, I mean sheep skins.

148
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,329
This is the happiest
day of my life...

149
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,666
Got it.
No shock for me.

150
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,793
Oh, yeah?

151
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,184
And now to help introduce
our fantastic new burger,

152
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,019
the one with ketchup,

153
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,439
here he is,
coming in by parachute,

154
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,607
Krusty the Clown!

155
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,418
"To audience.

156
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,464
"I now proclaim
this new burger...

157
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,174
For sale!"

158
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,060
Lord, save me.

159
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,983
It's the Krusty burglar.

160
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,279
Oh, my God.
He's stealing all the burgers!

161
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,280
Why, you little!

162
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,864
I've got you!

163
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,284
Oh, Homer!

164
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,578
It's... It's...
It's all just an act.

165
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,745
Stop!

166
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,372
Stop!

167
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,416
He's already dead!

168
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,001
Let go!

169
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,295
Get him!
Get him!

170
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,839
Uh, Krusty the Clown, everybody!

171
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,262
Please look at my MedicAlert bracelet.

172
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,816
Oh. Hey. Hey.

173
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,654
And then, take that

174
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,948
and put that in there,
and you...

175
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,368
There's your giraffe,
little girl.

176
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,494
I'm a boy.

177
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,746
That's the spirit.

178
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,456
Never give up.

179
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,833
I guess you're pretty impressed,
huh, Bart?

180
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,252
My dad got
Krusty the Clown

181
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,087
to personally appear
at my party.

182
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,049
I have a feeling I could get him
to appear at my house.

183
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,842
I don't know, Bart.

184
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,719
My dad's a pretty big wheel

185
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,513
down at the cracker factory.

186
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,731
Uh, it's not
5:30 yet.

187
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,619
- Hey, nice threads.
- I'm beat.

188
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,747
And after work,
I got to dedicate a new Jiffy Lube

189
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,874
and cohost
the Ace awards.

190
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,626
Wow! Jiffy Lube!

191
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,461
Boy, you're really
running yourself ragged.

192
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,714
Oh, yeah. When I started
this clown thing,

193
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,883
I thought it would be
nothing but glory.

194
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,886
You know, the glory
of being a clown?

195
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,973
But I tell you,
it's hard, tiring work.

196
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,477
But when I see the smiles
on their little faces,

197
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,855
I just know they're getting
ready to jab me with something.

198
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,736
My time's almost up here,
so I'd just like to say

199
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,862
I know Woody Allen.

200
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,702
And now the winner
for the most promising

201
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,620
new series on cable...

202
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,497
Old "Starsky and Hutches."

203
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,792
Accepting the award

204
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,002
is the son of the guy
who played Huggy Bear.

205
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,342
Let's walk and talk.

206
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,885
I have some
wonderful stories

207
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,905
about other famous people
that include me in some way.

208
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,223
Can't. I gotta go distract
bulls at a rodeo.

209
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,766
Hey, me, too.
We can go together.

210
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,394
Uh... No, I'm going
a different way

211
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,729
than you, Dick.

212
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,439
Your churlish
attitude reminds me

213
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,282
of a time I was having
dinner with Groucho...

214
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,085
Look, you're gonna be having
dinner with Groucho tonight

215
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,109
if you don't beat it.

216
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,157
Ah, being a clown sucks.

217
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,576
You get kicked by kids,
bit by dogs,

218
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,202
and admired by the elderly.

219
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,454
Who am I clowning?

220
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,414
I have no business
being a clown.

221
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,040
I'm leaving
the clowning business

222
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,044
to all the other clowns
in the clowning business.

223
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,587
Ah, no.

224
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,590
Well, well, well,
velocity boy.

225
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,633
I'm gonna give you the
biggest ticket you...

226
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,343
Hey! Krusty!

227
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,970
I'm not Krusty.

228
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,889
To think I was going
to give you a ticket!

229
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,890
Krusty the Clown!

230
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,141
I am not Krusty!

231
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,476
Hey, Krusty, Krusty,

232
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,060
you remember that time
we got loaded

233
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,520
and set those
beavers loose

234
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,147
in that pine
furniture store?

235
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,484
Ah, memories.

236
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,694
All right, you take
it easy, Krusty.

237
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,073
Hey, he didn't give me a ticket.

238
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,118
This is
an intriguing development.

239
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,704
You mean I get five percent off
on everything in the store

240
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,331
just because I look like...

241
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,209
I mean, just because
I am Krusty the Clown?

242
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,668
How could I charge full price

243
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,879
to the man whose lust
for filthy magazines

244
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,673
kept me in business during
that first shaky year?

245
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,344
By the way, here is your new issue
of "Gigantic Asses".

246
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,221
I'm telling you, Marge,
this will work.

247
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,115
They'll think I'm Krusty
and give us free stuff.

248
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,099
I've been getting
free stuff all day.

249
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,310
Look at this swell bucket
of house paint.

250
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,686
Look at it.

251
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,104
I'm not saying
it won't work.

252
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,397
I'm just saying
it's dishonest.

253
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,025
Well. If we agree,
then why are we arguing?

254
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,569
Hey, Krusty!

255
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,989
Hey, ooh, beautiful
date tonight, huh?

256
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,867
And such lovely
children you have.

257
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,202
I'm more striking
than lovely.

258
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,663
You come a-with me.
Come with Luigi.

259
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,331
You don't want to sit

260
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,958
with the rest of this a-scum.

261
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,545
I only consider you scum

262
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,088
compared to Krusty.

263
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,715
- Well, all right.
- Well, okay.

264
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,175
Yeah, you see
how you scum.

265
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,430
Let me get this straight.

266
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,325
You took all the money you made
franchising your name

267
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,518
and bet it against
the Harlem Globetrotters?

268
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,688
Oh, I thought
the Generals were due.

269
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,526
He's spinning the ball
on his finger!

270
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,735
Just take it!

271
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,862
Take the ball!

272
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,074
That game was fixed.

273
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,994
They were using a freakin' ladder
for God sakes.

274
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:34,081
I am afraid the time has come
for you to pay us.

275
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,164
Look, I'm cleaned out.

276
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,084
Just take the clown college.

277
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,586
We have already taken it.

278
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,671
Kids have a lot
of money these days

279
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,381
so after you finish
your performance,

280
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,744
you might consider robbing them.

281
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,885
Look, what can I tell you?

282
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,761
You can't get blood
from a turnip.

283
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,931
You want to kill me,
go ahead and kill me.

284
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,726
Oh, hey, hey, all right,
okay already!

285
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,769
Look, we can talk this over.

286
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,062
No more talk.

287
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,024
It is time for us
to take you for a ride.

288
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,692
Oh, no!

289
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,153
Mind if I go
to the bathroom first?

290
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,031
I see no harm in that.

291
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,500
When he's done in there,
I got to go.

292
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,841
Okay, wherever Krusty's gone,
we'll find him.

293
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,843
Legs, you check out
the east side.

294
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,803
Louie, Rome and Budapest.

295
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,556
Tell the boys I want
a total world search.

296
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,558
- Right, boss.
- Right, boss.

297
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,477
I want a free car
because I'm Krusty.

298
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,395
Krusty the Clown!

299
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,479
Get it?

300
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,106
Krusty.

301
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,278
Cancel the world search.

302
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,698
I want everything that's
coming to Krusty the Clown,

303
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,868
which is me, Krusty.

304
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,620
Hey, it's Krusty, all right.

305
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,081
Should I shoot him
gangland style

306
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,457
or execution style?

307
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,335
Listen to your heart.

308
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,128
Well, I can't give
you the car, Krusty.

309
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,838
But I can let you have
this little number

310
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,466
for practically nothing...
Only 38,000.

311
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,428
Hey, what are all these holes?

312
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,490
These are speed holes.
They make the car go faster.

313
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,225
Oh, yeah. Speed holes.

314
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,604
You want my advice?

315
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,939
I think you should
buy this car.

316
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,191
We need more ammo.

317
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,274
Let's go to Big 5.

318
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,114
Krusty, your plastic surgery
is complete.

319
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,991
When I remove the bandages

320
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,284
don't be alarmed by
the total stranger

321
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,411
staring back at you.

322
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,583
I look exactly the same,
you moron!

323
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,377
Nonsense, Krusty.

324
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,900
You look at least ten years younger,
plus, I did your breasts.

325
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,424
Does anyone hear me complaining
about the breasts?

326
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,300
Oh, what's the use in hiding?

327
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,262
I got to go back to Springfield
and face the music.

328
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,347
Can you loan me
bus fare?

329
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,724
Hey, hey, hey!

330
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,106
What you
diddley-doing, neighbor?

331
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,733
Putting speed holes
in my car.

332
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,109
Makes it go faster.

333
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,485
Is that so?

334
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,654
Gee, maybe the old
Flanders-mobile could use...

335
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,910
Wow! Lucky I always keep
a bible close to my heart.

336
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,083
Lucky I was wearing
an extra-large piece

337
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,544
of the true cross today.

338
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,670
I think I'll go inside.

339
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,008
What keeps doing that?

340
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,385
I told you we should have bought
more than three bullets.

341
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,512
Let's just grab him.

342
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,185
But wait, you can't kill me
for being Krusty.

343
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,186
I'm not him.

344
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,729
I'm Homer Simpson.

345
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,452
The same Homer Simpson
who crashed his car

346
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,899
through the wall
of our club?

347
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,609
Uh, actually,
my name is Barney.

348
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,985
Yeah, Barney Gumble.

349
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,403
The same Barney Gumble

350
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,781
who keeps taking pictures
of my sister?

351
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,824
Actually, my real name is, uh...

352
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,077
Think, Krusty, think...
Joe Valachi.

353
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,537
The same Joe Valachi who squealed
to the senate committee

354
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,039
about organized crime?

355
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,207
Benedict Arnold.

356
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,958
The same Benedict Arnold
who plotted

357
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,802
to surrender West Point
to the hated British?

358
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,802
I am so glad I had
a chance to meet you

359
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:19,598
before we did this, Krusty,
because I am a great fan.

360
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,476
Don Vittorio DiMaggio.

361
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,561
Krusty the Clown.

362
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,107
Sorry I have to do this, Krusty.

363
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,569
I cannot do it.

364
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,447
To murder a funny man
of such genius

365
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,907
would be a crime.

366
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,077
Tell you what, Krusty.

367
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,204
Do for me my
favorite trick,

368
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,748
where you ride the little bike
through the loop

369
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,834
and I will let you live.

370
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,919
But I've never been
able to do the...

371
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,314
Hey, how about if I just squirt you
in the face with my boutonniere?

372
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,339
Okay.

373
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,968
I'll never be able
to do this trick.

374
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,928
- Never.
- Go! Go!

375
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,515
Oh, oh, oh! Hey!

376
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,517
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!

377
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,019
I'm the greatest clown
in the world!

378
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,945
Ta-da!

379
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,073
The fact that you did not
do the trick well

380
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,742
is the biggest insult of all.

381
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,329
Hey, guys, I came to, uh...

382
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,391
Oh, you've got a deadly game
of cat and mouse going.

383
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,792
I'll come back.

384
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,503
I'm seeing double here.
Four Krusties.

385
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,838
Krusty!

386
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,464
Oh, thanks! Thanks a lot!

387
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,508
You came here to save me!

388
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,219
Yeah, that's what I did.

389
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,847
My apologies to you.

390
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,058
I almost made
a grievous error.

391
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,643
Good-bye, Krusty.

392
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,562
Wait! He can't kill anybody

393
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,485
if he doesn't know
which one's the real Krusty.

394
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,858
Oh, whoa!

395
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,443
Hup, ha ha!

396
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,820
I am confused.

397
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,114
Good one, Krusty.

398
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,741
Oh, crap.

399
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,827
Because of that
disrespectful display,

400
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,205
I shall now kill
both of you.

401
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,498
Unless...

402
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,293
you both go through the loop

403
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,586
together.

404
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,930
I can't see, you idiot!

405
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,598
Take your hands off my eyes.

406
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,617
- Hey!
- Hey!

407
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,868
Not bad.

408
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,329
Without the loop,
it is nothing.

409
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,749
Whoa!

410
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,715
Ta-da!

411
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,680
Yay, Krusties!

412
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,139
Hey, hey.

413
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,933
Grazie, grazie.

414
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:12,104
You have brought great joy
to this old Italian stereotype.

415
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,106
No, no, Don Vittorio,
you're not...

416
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,107
Yes, I am.

417
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,441
I know it, I am.

418
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,986
Anyway, thank you, Krusty.

419
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:19,987
You're welcome.

420
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,780
So we're even now, huh?

421
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,032
No, we just
won't kill you.

422
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,493
But you still
owe us the money.

423
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,787
Forty-eight dollars.

424
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,955
Here's 50.

425
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,124
And two your change.

426
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,333
And we thank you.
