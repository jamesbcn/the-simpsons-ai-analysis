17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,019
{\an8}This year's theme:
"Evil in the Age of Social Media."

18
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,107
{\an8}We have prepared
three breakout rooms

19
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,823
{\an8}for small group discussion.

20
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,113
{\an8}CROWD:
Hear, hear!

21
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,066
{\an8}These small rooms
are an excellent way

22
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,657
{\an8}for villains to mingle
with super-villains.

we will not be bothered

24

-(gasps and murmuring)

{\an8}Do not worry about Dr. Cain.

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,960
{\an8}The last I saw him,
my beautiful mistress

28
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,876
{\an8}was about to finish him off.

29
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,724
{\an8}Yes, that's what I did.

30
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,761
{\an8}You killed him, right?

31
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,474
{\an8}Yes, he was
the perfect lover...

32
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,015
{\an8}of being killed!

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,389
{\an8}It's a weird sentence,
but let's move on.

{\an8}Homer!

41

{\an8}People are here to see the movie,
not listen to you!

42

{\an8}Hey, Homer,
great yell-outs tonight!

43
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,628
{\an8}Lucky you, Marge!
You get to hear 'em the loudest!

00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,424
{\an8}This is my job.

not saying anything?

{\an8}There was enough talking
during the movie.

56

Shelbyville radio

152
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,739
You know...
maybe I should call in sick.

153
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,493
We could visit all
our old romantic haunts

154
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,695
that have closed and turned into
temporary Halloween stores.

155
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,997
I have to take Maggie
for her checkup.

156
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,041

the smell is under the house.

157
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,496
I get it.
You need your Marge time.

00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,134
But for 30 days,
this reporter

175
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,796
ate nothing but this
joker's deck of carbs.

176
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,467
And I say:

177
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,055
(thunder rumbles)

178
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,391
{\an8}Do you want lies with that?

179
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,111
Oh great. Another documentary
making me look like a scuzzbag.

180
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,525
What is it this time?

181
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,243
That the town I sponsor
in Africa doesn't exist?

182
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,874
Prove it!
Film all of Africa!

183
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,077
Day 12:
I've gained 20 pounds.

184
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,924
As for my cholesterol...

185
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,589
It's bad.
You can just scrape it right off.

186
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,841
But still I soldier on
with my "Laffy Meal."

187
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,676
(grunting and gagging)

188
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,852
(humming)

189
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,103
Hey,
this is all above-board.

190
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,401
One month
of eating Krusty Burger

191
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,573
and nothing else
has transformed me

192
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:52,703
into a morbidly obese,
toilet-busting American.

193
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,782
If I don't have
some kind of nugget

194
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,407
every five minutes, I'll die.

195
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,043
I'm so weak...

196
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,833
I can't even fill out
this application

<i>But it'll be worth it</i>

199
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:16,223
if my suffering teaches Krusty
the value of proper nutrition.

200
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,725
You're gonna be my
breakfast English sausage!

201
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,979

(Bart chuckles)

205
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,406
Man, when you're not at work,

206
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,504
you see so many
beautiful things.

And now, because it's afternoon,

212
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:07,022
I can go to Moe's without having
a "drinking problem." (chuckles)

213

(beer pouring)

214
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,026
Hey, Homer.
I could hear your

215
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,939
pathetic rationalizing
through the door.

216
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,358
Well, why can't I
hang out at the bar all day?

217
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,117
My wife doesn't want
to be with me.

218
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,078
Look, I'd love to discuss
your problems,

219
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,079
but a pack of raccoons
took over my back room,

220
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,201
and today's the day
I make my stand.

221
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,958
(wild screaming,
raccoons chittering)

222
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,290
MOE: Aah! Aah!
There's more than I thought!

223
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,928
I wish I could
pull down my zipper

224
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,102
and that guy would come out.

225
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,520
CAIN: Stranger things
have happened, Homer.

226
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,889

Stradivarius Cain!

227
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,897
What the...?
Am I losing my marbles?

228
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,610
No, I'm just
an illusion caused by

229
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,570
the concussion you suffered
at the plant.

230
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,111
Can I put my hand
through you?

231
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,655
If you want.

232
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,238
C'mon... really?

233
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,033
Show a little class.

234
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,366
Sorry.

235
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,411
Now I'm about to undertake
my toughest mission ever:

236
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,666
to make you into a man
your wife can't resist.

237
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,166
What the...?
No one can see you!

238
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,304
Other people's imaginary
friends can see me.

239
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,763
(groans)

240
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,932
Hello, Dr. Cain.

241
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,602
Hello, Hufnpuffalus.

242
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,481
Sorry I slept
with your girlfriend.

243
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,349
You did me a favor, man.

244
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,016
(Nelson humming)

245
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,105
Lunch money, lunch money,
lunch money.

246
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,361
Hey, Lis.

247
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,192
Nelson, don't you want
my lunch money?

248
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,357
Nah. Chicks wind up
getting all your money anyway.

249
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,567
That's sexist,
but thank you.

250
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,078
Now I gotta go liberate some
cash from your brother.

251
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,540
Well, if you must.

252
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,120
See if you can find out
where my dolls are.

253
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,706
You might not like
the answer.

254
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,171
I just want closure.

255
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,747
Simpson, you know
why I'm here.

256
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,338
Nelson, I could give you
my lunch money...

257
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,675
or I could give you...

258
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,430
Lunch?

259
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,012
Actual lunch?!

260
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,017
Look at all them burgers
and fries.

261
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,479
I didn't know they served
these things warm!

262
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,600
Aw... they feel
like a baby's head.

263
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,768
I just thank God you didn't take
my coupons.

264
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,608
Got enough for a month.

265
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,493
Free hamburger?!
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

266
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,201
No, you give them
the coupon,

267
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,661
and they give you
the hamburger.

268
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,831
I knew that.

269
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,618
(chuckles)

270
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,998
I must say,
whoever installed

271
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:37,045
your car's secret weapons
did a great job hiding them.

272
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,381
Yeah, Dr. Cain,
the thing about that is...

273
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,798
uh, there aren't any weapons.

274
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,637
What?! Well, does your car
at least turn into something else?

275
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,894
Sometimes Marge says
I turn it into a trashcan.

276
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,227
Hmm... (groans).

277
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,983
Homer, you are going
to clean up this car,

278
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,234
put on cologne, and become
a sparkling conversationalist.

279
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,238
Sounds like you're turning
into wife number two.

280
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,410
I can do that.

281
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,487
So, stick with Marge!

282
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,744
(Homer gasping)

283
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,325
Whoa, what's going on
there, Lou?

284
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,251
Well, if you ask me,
Chief...

285
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,410
(low groan)

286
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,998
All right,
what does this mean?

287
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,500
Childhood obesity...

288
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,086
(chuckles)
it's not funny anymore!

289
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,631
Breakfast cereals where
the surprise inside is diabetes

290
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,756
and soda cups the size
of hot tubs

291
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,263
have made every state
Mississippi-fat.

292
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,927
Mmm-mmm!

293
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,305
(gasps)
That's Nelson!

294
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,352
No, you're imagining
things.

295
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,057
What else you got?

296
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,937
Just bubbling oil.

297
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,284
Stand back
and give me a straw.

298
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,700
(gasps)

299
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,199
Now, the ultimate test:

300
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,911
I want you to convince...
that woman

301
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,123
to give herself to you
body and soul.

302
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,205
But I'm a married man.

303
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,630
Yeah, I know.
A married man is never attracted

304
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,709
to a beautiful woman
he doesn't even know,

305
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,295
but this will give you the confidence
you need with Marge.

306
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,972
Okay, I'll make
a stranger love me forever.

307
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,102
And Homer, remember:

308
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,679
it doesn't matter
what you say

309
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,774
as long as you say it
with confidence.

310
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,351
Mm-hmm!

311
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,435
My dear, did you just
fall from heaven?

312
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,442
'Cause your hair looks
really messed up.

313
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,105
Okay, it matters
a little what you say.

314
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,443
Moving on...

315
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,148
You know what wood
makes the best

316
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,698
ventriloquist dummy?
Maple.

317
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,368
How many hardboiled eggs
do you think I can eat?

318
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,134
(groans)
Look, just say this:

319
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,128
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Mm!

320
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,960
When I was in special ops,

321
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,665
they held me
in an Afghan prison

322
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,965
where all I could see
was a patch of blue sky.

323
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,970
But that blue
was nothing compared

324
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,062
to the blue of your eyes.

325
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,099
Oh... I am a sucker
for articulate fatsos.

326
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,806
(giggles)

327
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,056
MAN:
What is this?

328
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,687
I leave for two seconds
to get chocolate martinis,

329
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,284
and my wife is expertly seduced
by this pork empanada!

330
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,951
(gasps)
What do I do?

331
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,070
Squirt that lemon
in his eye!

332
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,447
You think a lemon
will stop me?!

333
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,540
A lime! No...!

334
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,462
(laughing)

335
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,793
Did you see the guy?

336
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,127
(humming)

337
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,263
Marge, what brings you
to the S.N.P.P.?

338
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,301
Homie's been working
so hard.

339
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,394
I thought I'd bring him
a special lunch.

340
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,850
Marge, you're a blue angel.

341
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,850
And I'm not talking about
those pilots that hot dog in

342
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,892
an air show while the real men
are in combat.

343
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,595
But I gotta ask:
where's Homer working?

344
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,226
Here, right?

345
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,273
Not since Burns gave him
that time off.

346
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,147
-What is this? Week six?
-What?!

347
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,323
I knew there was a reason
he was leaving on time!

348
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,323
Oh, I can't believe this!

349
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,494
(tires squeal)

350
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,155
What'd you say to her?

351
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,503
I don't know. I thought I was
making small talk.

352
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,749
But it turned out
to be big talk.

353
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:06,005
(Krusty, chimpanzee
grunting loudly)

354
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,592
-What?!
-Krusty!

355
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,467
This once-vibrant
young bully

356
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,893
won't even live to pick on
kids in junior high!

357
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,353
Because he's been eating
nothing but your food!

358
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,943
Atta boy!

359
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,438
(coughs)

360
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,860
Got any fries, man?
I just need a couple.

361
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,819
Not my responsibility.

362
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,729
He didn't have
to order that crap.

363
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,398
We've got yogurt
and salad on the menu!

364
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,817
Do you actually serve
those items?

365
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,026
No. Mmm...

366
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,948
All right, kid,
to make this right,

367
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,787
I'm gonna hook you up
with my personal trainer.

368
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,343
Billy, get this kid
into superhero shape!

369
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,499
Hugh Jackman Wolverine?

370
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,797
I'm not made of money.

371
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,260
Alicia Silverstone Batgirl?

372
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,511
He's that now.

373
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,263
(tires screech)

374
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,306
(humming)

375
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,851
-(gasps)
-Busy day at work?

376
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,265
Did you get a lot
of work done, worker man?

377
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,015
What do I do?
What do I do?!

378
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,067
Take her by those shoulders
she never covers

379
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,991
and tell her the truth.

380
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,199
You're right, Marge,
I lied.

381
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,660
Don't give me
that load of... Huh?

382
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,161
I got a head injury
at work,

383
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,912
and they gave me eight
weeks paid vacation.

384
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,834
Head injury?!
Why didn't you tell me?

385
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,003
And I spent all
that time learning

386
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,132
how to be a better husband.

387
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,839
The kind of husband you deserve.

388
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,339
Wha...?

389
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,592
Kiss her.
Kiss her while I watch.

390
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,134
(gasps)

391
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,297
(both moaning)

392
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,681
Mmm...

393
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,175
HOMER:
The three of us are going

394
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,346
to the most romantic restaurant
in town.

395
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,726
This car's so clean!

396
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,074
I'm not getting flea bites
on my ankles!

397
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,780
I have bug-bombed
the car for m'lady.

398
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,112
(giggles)

399
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,453
MARGE:
Whoo! Whoo!

400
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,788
-(grunts)
-(gasps)

401
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,870
(groans)

402
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,535
We meet again!

403
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,285
Looking for this?

404
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,298
He won't be out for long.
Flee, my love!

405
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,717
(panting)

406
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,216
Why is he trying
to kill you,

407
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,387
and why did she call
you her love?

408
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,846
It was all
a training exercise

409
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,226
to make me smooth
for you.

410
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,822
Of course, she fell for me, and of
course, I wanted no part of her.

411
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,028
Now the only one who can help us
is Stradivarius Cain.

412
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,320
-The guy from the movie?
-I'll explain later.

413
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,203
Strad, come back!

414
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,820
I know you're in there!

415
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,987
No.
Not you.

416
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,656
Big fan, but no.

417
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,044
Cleatus the football robot,
you're my only hope!

418
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,542
(Fox NFL theme plays)

419
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,089
No one likes you!

420
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,883
(machinery whirs)

421
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,137
DRUG LORD:
How can a fat man hide so well?

422
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,352
(hushed)
Strad, where are you?

423
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,938
You can handle him, Homer.

424
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,148
Just remember
what I taught you.

425
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,517
When I was in special ops,

426
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,027
they held me
in an Afghan prison

427
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,029
where all I could see was
a patch of blue sky.

428
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,862
But that blue was
nothing compared

429
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,737
with the blue of your eyes.

430
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,535
I cannot kill
a poet like you.

431
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,039
And you are
a very lucky woman.

432
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,882
This is why I always say
"mingle at parties."

433
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,918
It's how I met Greg Kinnear.

434
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,962
Ay!
With the Greg Kinnear again.

435
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,455
Can't friends talk
about friends?

436
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,877
He is not your friend!

437
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,375
Then why did he say he'd call me
when he comes to Bolivia?

438
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,547
(sighs)

439
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,216
We used to be like them.

440
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,755
Mmm.

441
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,194
So, how many more weeks
do you have off?

442
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,728
Actually, I was supposed
to be back last week.

443
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,272
(laughs)

444
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:54,065
We'll just wait for the call
from Human Resources.

445
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,078
I guess my work here is done.

446
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,619
But Stradivarius Cain will
return in "Lisa Gets a B Plus."

447
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,037
(gunshot)

448
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,875
I knew you were mad at me.

449
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,551
At the risk
of inflaming Sister Fate,

450
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,131
this bully-free period
has been an Arcadian idyll!

451
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,718
-Hear, hear!
-Idyll!

452
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,142
(gasping)

453
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,391
-Ha-ha!
-(grunts)

454
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,643
(gasping, clamoring)

455
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,396
(Nelson, kids grunting)

456
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,323
I administer with this nose!

457
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,243
This is a happy ending?

458
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,372
Well, he's tough on nerds,
but easy on the eyes.

459
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,870
What'd you just say?

460
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,252
Nothing.

461
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,747
-(crowd murmuring)
-Shh!

462
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,968
