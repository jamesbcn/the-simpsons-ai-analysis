So, how was the office
birthday party?

00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,393
- It was delightful.
- Ooh.

7
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,765
The frosting on the cake
was this thick.

8
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,903
And Eugene Fisk... my poor sucker
of an assistant...

9
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,781
Didn't know the fruit punch
was spiked

10
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,938
and he really made
an ass of himself

11
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,007
putting the moves on the new girl
in Valve Maintenance.

12
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,619
Does this girl like him?

13
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,578
I have to warn you, Marge,

14
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,499
I think the poor young thing
has the hots for yours truly.

15
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,698
Homer.

16
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,578
Just keeping you on your
toes, babe.

17
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,091
Two hundred and thirty nine pounds!
I'm a blimp.

18
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,220
Why are all the good things
so tasty?

19
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,878
From now on,
exercise every morning.

20
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,263
You're not a blimp, Homer.

21
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,307
You're my big cuddly teddy bear.

22
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:28,228
Nah, baloney. Yeah, right.

23
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,404
Give me a break.

24
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,823
Wow, cool, man!

25
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,671
No!

26
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,134
Two hundred
and thirty nine pounds?

27
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,175
I'm a whale.

28
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,849
Why was I cursed with this
weakness for snack treats?

29
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,769
Well, from now on, exercise every morning,
Homer.

30
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,437
Don't strain yourself, dear.

31
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,691
Good idea, Marge.

32
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,072
By the way, this Friday night

33
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,790
I'm gonna be attending a little
get together with the boys at work.

34
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,241
Eugene Fisk is marrying
some girl in Valve Maintenance.

35
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,492
Homer, is this
some kind of stag party?

36
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,945
No, no, Marge.
It's gonna be very classy.

37
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,287
A tea-and-crumpet kind of thing.

38
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,292
Eugene Fisk.
Isn't he your assistant?

39
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,544
No! My supervisor.

40
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,247
Didn't he used to be
your assistant?

41
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,417
Hey, what is this,
the Spanish exposition?

42
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,715
Sorry, Homer.

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,930
It's
the "fe-mailman."

44
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,220
Female carrier, Bart.

45
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,974
Lady, where's my spy camera?

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,037
- "Where's my spy camera?"
- Where's my spy camera?

47
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,099
Every day for the last six months.

48
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,476
- Where's my spy camera?
- Where's my spy camera?

49
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,483
- Where's my spy camera?
- Where's my spy camera?

50
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,613
Here's your stupid spy camera!

51
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,952
Thanks, ma'am.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,450
Whoa, man.

53
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,372
Look at the size of this thing.

54
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,371
I wonder if it really works.

55
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,288
'Cause I got
a lot of spying to do.

56
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,472
Bart!
What are you doing?

57
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,510
Sorry, Dad. The answer
to that is top secret.

58
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,309
Ooh!

59
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,313
- Bart.
- What?

60
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,685
Go take some wildlife pictures
or something.

61
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,147
Ha.

62
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,739
Ew, gross.

63
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,911
Mom, Bart was taking
a picture of his butt.

64
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,121
Sure. Like I'm really gonna
take a picture of my butt.

65
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:49,042
Stop it, you two.
And put on some nice clothes.

66
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,042
Since it's just
the four of us tonight,

67
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,694
we're having dinner
at The Rusty Barnacle.

68
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,589
Yay, fried shrimp!

69
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,709
Aw, Mom. Can't we just
grab a burger at...

70
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,877
Only four of us?
Who escaped?

71
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,426
Your father.
He's having a boys' night out.

72
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,930
Just as I was asking myself,

73
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,603
"Where did my seven-year-old
boy get the money...

74
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,853
for a Father's Day present?"

75
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,265
I opened the box.

76
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:17,614
And inside was little
Eugene's baseball glove.

77
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,452
He had given me the one thing

78
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,448
that mattered most to him
in the whole world.

79
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,450
Eugene, when I see you...

80
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,802
The one thing that matters
most to me in the whole world...

81
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,486
Married tomorrow,

82
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,118
I'm going to know
just how you felt that day.

83
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,495
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, son.

84
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,554
Where am I, the planet Cornball?

85
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,188
Hey, don't worry.
Things are gonna pick up

86
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,633
once the entertainment
gets here.

87
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,335
- Ooh, entertainment.
- Yes, sir.

88
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,020
Ahoy! I spy
the children's menu.

89
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,482
- Ahoy, this place bites.
- Bart.

90
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,773
So, what's it gonna be,
me little bucko?

91
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,067
Let's see.

92
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,781
This evening
I shall go for the...

93
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,322
-squid platter,
-Ew.

94
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,406
With extra tentacles, please.

95
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,582
Bart. Excuse me, sir.

96
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,910
The party next door seems
to be a little raucous.

97
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,707
Could you please ask them
to quiet down a little bit, please?

98
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,212
Aye, aye.

99
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,972
Hey, try to keep it down, guys.

100
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,264
- Okay?
- Hey, shut up.

101
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,098
♪ Open the door and lie on the floor
said Barnacle Bill the sailor ♪

102
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,533
Here you go.

103
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,358
There you are.
For the baby.

104
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,954
And one squid platter,
extra tentacles.

105
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,142
Bart, quit fooling around
and eat your dinner.

106
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,120
Yeah, eat it, Bart.

107
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,584
May I please
be excused for a minute?

108
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,035
Okay, but don't dawdle.

109
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,705
Your food will get cold.

110
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,924
Okay, Eugene.

111
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,724
One last taste
of bachelor freedom.

112
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,427
Presenting Princess Kashmir,

113
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,774
queen of the mysterious East.

114
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,320
Now this is what I call a party.

115
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,663
How do I tell you this, my boy?
We're in hell.

116
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,159
Look at him squirm.

117
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,253
- You care to dance?
- She wants you, Homer.

118
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,079
Go for it, Homer!

119
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,918
Shake his buns.

120
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,005
I'm sorry.
I don't usually laugh like this.

121
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,016
Ai, caramba.
Wow, man.

122
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,151
This is the most
fun I've ever had in my life.

123
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:13,033
The meeting of The Future
Photographers of America is now in session.

124
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,287
We would like to welcome
our new member, Bart Simpson.

125
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,830
Whoa. People, people.

126
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,874
Don't applaud.
Let's get to work.

127
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,514
My goodness.
Quite exciting.

128
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,130
Extremely sensual.

129
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,777
The subtle gray tones recall
the work of Helmut Newton.

130
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,721
Who's the sexy lady, Bart?

131
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,433
Beats me. But the guy
dancing with her is my pop.

132
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,305
- Wow!
- He brings to mind

133
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,491
the later work of Diane Arbus.

134
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,438
Bart, I'd really appreciate
a print of your masterwork.

135
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,561
- Me too.
- Yeah, come on.

136
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,437
Sorry, guys.
No can do.

137
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,444
Aw.

138
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,196
Come on, Bart. You're gonna
make me a print, aren't you?

139
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,278
Will you swear not to
let another living soul

140
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,534
get a copy of this photo?

141
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,125
- Okay.
- Cross your heart and hope to die?

142
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,388
- Yep.
- Stick a needle in your eye?

143
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,759
- Yep.
- Jam a dagger in your thigh?

144
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,326
- Yep.
- Eat a horse manure pie?

145
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,252
- Yep.
- Well, okay.

146
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,922
Pst. Look what I got.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,670
Whoa. I gotta
have a copy of that.

148
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,672
- Sorry.
- Aw, come on.

149
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,804
Well, okay.

150
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,007
Hey, Bart. How come
Milhouse gets a copy

151
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,556
of your girlie picture
and I don't?

152
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,139
I thought I was your friend too.

153
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,604
Well, okay.

154
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,330
Son, why are you wasting your time
with this sleazy trash?

155
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,916
Sorry, Dad.

156
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,462
Wait till I show
the guys at work this little doozy.

157
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,926
Mike, this is Al.

158
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,930
Just wanted to thank you for the
"informative memo" you faxed me.

159
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,934
Whoops. Here comes the boss.
Gotta go.

160
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,096
Reverend Lovejoy,
your wife confiscated this

161
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,395
from one of the boys in the choir.

162
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,939
Why this sheep has strayed
from my own flock. His name's...

163
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,744
Homer Simpson, sir,
a low-level employee...

164
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,948
- in sector 7-G.
- Simpson?

165
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,159
- A family man?
- Wife and three kids, sir.

166
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,699
I'd like to see
our self-styled Valentino

167
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,743
tomorrow morning, Smithers.

168
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,421
What are we laughing at?

169
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,380
One glazed and one Scratch-'N-Win, please.

170
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,008
You look familiar, sir. Are you
on the television or something?

171
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,505
Sorry, buddy. You got me
confused with Fred Flintstone.

172
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,928
Liberty Bell.

173
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,148
Another Liberty Bell!

174
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,148
One more and I'm a millionaire.

175
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,150
Come on, Liberty Bell,
please, please, please.

176
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,903
D' That purple fruit thing.

177
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,196
Where were you yesterday?

178
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,779
Hey, hey.
Looking good.

179
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,034
- What do you want, pal?
- Hey mister.

180
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,367
♪ Do, do, do, do, do ♪

181
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,123
♪ Do dee do dee do ♪

182
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,785
Well a "do dee do dee do"
to you too, pint size.

183
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,134
Jeez, you get a lot
of nutcases in here.

184
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,750
Sir, I've seen things
you can't imagine.

185
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,127
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I hear you, buddy.

186
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,176
Full moon.

187
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,638
Still got it.

188
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,112
What is the meaning of this?

189
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,780
Meaningless, Marge.

190
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,531
Don't even attempt
to find meaning in it.

191
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,573
There's nothing between me
and Princess Kashmir.

192
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,987
- Princess who?
- Hey, my photo.

193
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,656
Your photo?

194
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,714
- Why you little...
- Why you big...

195
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,668
- Bart, go to your room.
- I'm out of here.

196
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,788
- Look, Marge, honey, baby, doll, I...
- Homer,

197
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,746
I don't even want
to look at you right now.

198
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,798
What are you saying, honey?

199
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,221
- But where will I sleep?
- My suggestion

200
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,550
is for you to sleep
in the filth you created.

201
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,716
Would a motel be okay?

202
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,234
I knew you'd come to your...

203
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:18,526
Here. If you have
any soul left, you'll need these.

204
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,782
I know I will.

205
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,384
What's the matter, Homer?

206
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,963
Hottest ladies' night in months

207
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,527
and you're not even
checking out the action.

208
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,759
Moe.
My wife gave me

209
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,973
the old heave ho because
of some lousy picture.

210
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,644
- What, this one?
- D'

211
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,893
So, where are you
staying tonight, Homer?

212
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,595
Motel, I guess.

213
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,845
No.
No pal of mine

214
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,227
is gonna stay
in some dingy flophouse.

215
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,993
If you get hungry
in the middle of the night,

216
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,660
there's an open beer
in the fridge.

217
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,290
Look, Barney. See the row
of tiny lights up there?

218
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,788
The middle one is my house.

219
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,791
Someone must have left
the porch light on.

220
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,793
Hey that's rough, pal.

221
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,837
Hello, Marge.

222
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,011
- You left your damn porch light on.
- Barney!

223
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,339
Homer's not
made of money, you know.

224
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,105
- Who is this?
- Don't listen to him, Marge. He's...

225
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,545
Oh, it's you.

226
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,308
Homer, you're overwrought.

227
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,390
Why don't you unwind a little bit?

228
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,476
Party down the hall.

229
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,481
You know, this apartment
complex caters

230
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,733
to upscale young singles like me.

231
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,817
No, Barn.
I just want to crawl into bed.

232
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,613
Suit yourself, Homer.
Nighty-night.

233
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,790
I wonder when Dad's coming home.

234
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,851
Homer Simpson.

235
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,063
Homer Simpson. Report at once
to Mr. Burns' office.

236
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,353
No.

237
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,187
What in blue blazes

238
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,773
do you think
you're doing, Simpson?

239
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,108
- What do you mean, sir?
- I mean this.

240
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,323
A plant employee carrying on

241
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,534
like an oversexed
orangutan in heat.

242
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,575
This is a family nuclear
power plant, Simpson.

243
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,860
Our research indicates
that over 50 percent of our power

244
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,832
is used by women.

245
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,084
I will not have you
offending my customers

246
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,416
with your bawdy shenanigans.

247
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,341
It won't happen again, sir.
I promise.

248
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,880
May I get out of your sight now?

249
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,303
Just a second, Simpson.

250
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,301
Smithers, would you leave
the room for a minute?

251
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,343
Yes, sir.

252
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:53,143
Simpson, I am by most
measures a successful man.

253
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:58,515
I have wealth and power beyond the
dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk.

254
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,146
And yet, I've led a solitary life.

255
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,073
The fair sex remains a mystery to me.

256
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,573
You seem to have a way
with women, a certain...

257
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,735
How shall I put it...

258
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,744
Animal magnetisme.

259
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,576
Help me, Simpson.

260
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,661
Tell me your secret.

261
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,167
Mr. Burns, in spite of
what everybody thinks,

262
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,339
I'm no lover boy.

263
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,588
Simpson, I'm asking you nicely.

264
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,420
- I don't really know, sir.
- Simpson!

265
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,255
Well, I wine them, I...

266
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,301
dine them, bring them flowers,

267
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,304
write them love poetry, sir.

268
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,306
Of course.

269
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,268
It's simplicity itself.

270
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,440
I won't forget this, Simpson.

271
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:40,858
Now return to your work and tell
no one of what transpired here.

272
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,912
- Anybody home?
- Hi, Daddy.

273
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,909
Welcome back, Dad.

274
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,741
How's your mom?

275
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,786
Still kind of ticked off.

276
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,790
Yeah, good luck, man.

277
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,252
Thanks boy.

278
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,786
Hello, Marge.

279
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,957
It's me, Homer.

280
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,296
Are you still mad?

281
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,802
You are still mad.
Don't need to say it.

282
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,295
I'm your loving husband.
I can read you like a book.

283
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,308
I'll just have some milk.

284
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,020
Look, I'm not drinking
out of the carton.

285
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,358
Come on, Marge!
Please forgive me.

286
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,069
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

287
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,201
Homer, you don't even know
why you're apologizing.

288
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,819
Yes, I do.
Because I'm hungry,

289
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,487
my clothes are smelly,
and I'm tired.

290
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,496
I've been thinking, Homer,

291
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,998
and you know what bothers me
the most about this whole thing?

292
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,331
You taught Bart
a very bad lesson.

293
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,337
Your boy idolizes you.

294
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,799
- He does not.
- Yes, he does, Homer.

295
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,339
And when he sees you
treating women as objects,

296
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,344
he's going to think
that it's okay.

297
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,336
You owe your son
better than that, Homer.

298
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,258
So what should I do, Marge?

299
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,346
Well, I think you
should take Bart

300
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,893
to meet this exotic
belly-person.

301
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,647
I want him to see
that she's a real human being

302
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,320
with real thoughts
and real feelings.

303
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,359
I want Bart to see you apologize

304
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,653
for the way you treated her.

305
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,446
Okay. Your wish is
my command, my little...

306
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,490
Do it!

307
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,499
Princess Kashmir?
You must mean April Flower.

308
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,773
She's working
over at the Girlesque.

309
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,842
Ooh.

310
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,678
See, I'm trying
to teach my son here

311
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,140
about treating women as objects.

312
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,849
That's a good idea.

313
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,489
But April's over
at Foxy Boxing tonight.

314
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,476
Just let me say
that it is an honor

315
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,538
to have Springfield's number-one
swinger here with us to...

316
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Forget that.

317
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,145
I'm teaching my boy a lesson.
Is she here or not?

318
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,441
Try Mud City.

319
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,985
Marge? Marge?

320
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,320
We're gonna try one more
place, the Sapphire Lounge.

321
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,326
Bart! I said look at
the floor.

322
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,205
There she is.
Hey, Princess!

323
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,091
It's me, the guy
from the snapshot.

324
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,128
Hi.

325
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,302
- Places, ladies, places.
- Ooh.

326
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,800
Can I get just a little cooperation?
It's show time.

327
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,893
Look. I'm here
because I want to apologize

328
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,508
for treating you like an object.

329
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,305
I also want my boy

330
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,968
to find out that you're
more than just a belly.

331
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,158
I want him
to meet the woman behind

332
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,604
all the spangles and glitter

333
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,355
and find out that she has
thoughts and feelings too.

334
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,608
Well, okay.
But can we make it quick?

335
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,400
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

336
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,444
Could you tell him
a little about yourself?

337
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,818
Well, my real name is Shawna Tifton.

338
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,945
My pet peeve is rude people.

339
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,952
And my turn-ons include silk sheets

340
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,965
- and a warm fireplace.
- Thank you very much, ma'am.

341
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,955
We'll be on our...

00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,455

- My boss will freak out.
