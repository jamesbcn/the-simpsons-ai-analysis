1
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:36,737
Aw, water soup again?

2
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,340
Now it's crow soup.

3
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,542
Ooh, I call an eye!

4
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,344
- Me, two!
- Me, three!

5
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,513
And Maggie gets the beak.

6
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:55,056
Your hovel got
in the way of my horse.

7
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,191
Kiss his hooves
in apology.

8
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,029
Oh, please,
forgive us, noble steed.

9
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:04,865
Our nostrils are not
worthy of your mighty stench.

10
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:07,201
Are those new
horseshoes?

11
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:09,203
Oh, they look good on you!

12
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,877
Lousy nobles!

13
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,879
We serfs are starving,
while they're feasting

14
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,881
and jousting
and posing for tapestries

15
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,716
where they're friends
with a unicorn.

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,552
As if any unicorn
would like them.

17
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,720
Unicorns like nice people,
I'm a nice person.

18
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,557
Young lady, that kind of
talk is anti-feudalist,

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,225
and I won't have it!

20
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,861
Without feudalism, we
wouldn't have this hovel,

21
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,965
our bountiful filth,
or my awesome buboes.

22
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:39,700
I'll lance you later.

23
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,206
Bart! They just stuck
new severed heads up

24
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,874
on the city walls!

25
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,742
Can we go, Ma?
Can we? Can we?

26
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,878
That's a lovely idea.

27
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,913
And we can bring my mom.

28
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:56,084
I hope she's doing okay
in her new nursing home.

29
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,989
Which one is your mom's web?

30
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,923
Son, is that you?

31
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,192
No.

32
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:07,228
Ah, you ruined my nap!

33
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,929
Just like you ruined
my daughter's life.

34
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,531
That's her.

35
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,270
They didn't skimp
on the tar.

36
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:19,107
That's the secret
to long-lasting heads.

37
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,609
Oh, there's Ned Flanders!

38
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,112
It's always nice when
you know someone.

39
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:27,848
Those are the kind of sideburns
I was saying you should grow.

40
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:30,851
Pretty sharp.

41
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,454
Pretty, pretty sharp.

42
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,089
See how the heads
of rich people

43
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:37,025
get the tallest pikes
with the best view?

44
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,292
It's so unfair.

45
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,294
I told you
to lay off feudalism.

46
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,130
It's the only system we know.

47
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,133
We have no choice about it,
and therefore it's the best.

48
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,801
The system is designed
to keep us down.

49
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,137
That's not true.

50
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,871
In a great country
like ours,

51
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,308
a poor girl can grow up
to be anything she wants...

52
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:57,445
a wife or a harlot
and... that's it.

53
00:02:57,478 --> 00:03:01,182
I wanted to be a harlot,
but it's all who you know.

54
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,816
It's never too late.

55
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,186
Everyone is somebody's
weird fetish.

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,789
Mom. What's wrong
with your skin?

57
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,791
It's blue,
and ice-cold.

58
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,327
This could be a
serious disease.

59
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,829
Homer, she needs
medical attention.

60
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,832
Pretty, pretty sharp.

61
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,504
It's never easy to say this.

62
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,673
You've got...
Genital Snerfs.

63
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,675
<i>La, la, la-la, la-la</i>

64
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,343
<i>We love our new home</i>

65
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:32,546
Doc, is there any way to
control occasional flare-ups?

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,681
Nope.

67
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,184
Yeah! Yay! Yippee!

68
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,253
Now, what have we here?

69
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,822
Progressive
frozen-mortification!

70
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:46,194
This can only be the bite
of an Ice Walker!

71
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,661
An Ice Walker?

72
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,663
Mom, how did
this happen?

73
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:53,701
I dated a ravenous wight who
abhors the warmth of the living.

74
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,769
- And?
- He got fresh.

75
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:58,106
I'm sorry, baby.
I know I screwed up.

76
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,108
But you got to give me
another chance.

77
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,709
I love you.

78
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,712
She's 900 years younger
than you, you pervert.

79
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,515
I like 'em young,
that ain't no crime.

80
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,619
Is my mom
gonna be okay?

81
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,721
I'm sorry,
but a week from now,

82
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,889
your mother
will be frozen solid.

83
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,126
No! No, that can't be.

84
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:20,561
She's barely into
her hag years.

85
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,731
All you can do is give her
leeches for the pain.

86
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,033
Here's an organizer.

87
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,470
So... So there's nothing
we can do to save her?

88
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,405
Well,
there's one treatment.

89
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,708
All we have to do
is buy this amulet.

90
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,577
My mom is saved!

91
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,078
Yeah...

92
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,913
but a hundred GP?

93
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,416
I mean, that's more than a
tenth-level fighter makes

94
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,452
in an entire campaign.

95
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,987
Don't worry, we'll
figure it out.

96
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,258
Hey, sweet young thang.

97
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,660
What time they cuttin'
you down?

98
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,095
Ooh, baby!

99
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,236
Okay, we just need to come up
with a hundred gold pieces.

100
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,405
How much do we have
in our savings?

101
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,440
Hmm, let me think.

102
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,443
There's that thing...

103
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,946
What are savings?

104
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,782
Well, then we can sell
our possessions.

105
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,417
The pig. The spoon.

106
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,187
The gelatinous cube has
to be worth something.

107
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,623
Is this because of
what happened to the cat?

108
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,427
I told him not to nap on me.
So... that's on him.

109
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,197
Look, honey,
I love your mom.

110
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,932
As crones go, she's tops.

111
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,967
But does it make sense...

112
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,805
I mean total sense
to spend all that money

113
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,975
so a really old lady
can get a little bit older?

114
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,644
This is my mom's life!

115
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,814
This family will do whatever
it takes to keep her alive!

116
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,482
Is that understood?

117
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,717
Of course. Of course.

118
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,951
- Good.
- Good.

119
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,253
Good.

120
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:55,155
All I'm saying is...

121
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:58,292
Homer Serfson,

122
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:01,662
you are the most selfish jerk
in the entire Tri-Kingdom Area!

123
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,831
I should have listened
to that witch

124
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,133
and married
my twin brother, Markery.

125
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,002
Always here
if you need me, sis.

126
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,071
Get lost, freak!
She chose me!

127
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,341
You get that money
to save my mom,

128
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,510
or never set foot
in this hovel again!

129
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,480
Good things come
to those who wait.

130
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,888
Is Marge still sore
at you, Homer?

131
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,524
Yeah. It's not like
I want to kill her mother.

132
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,860
I just want to let
her die from neglect.

133
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,395
If I don't get
the money for that amulet,

134
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,765
I'll be sleeping
on the iron couch.

135
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,236
Now, let's see here.
An urgent message

136
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,739
for Milady Gwendolyn Partz.

137
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,608
Milady Partz?

138
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,110
Hey, has anyone seen
Milady Partz?

139
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,412
Ah, come on,
somebody grab Milady Partz!

140
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,982
That depends... how
big is your dowry?

141
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,554
You little craven, if
I ever get my hands on you,

142
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,591
I'm gonna slice you open and
drain all of your humors...

143
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,259
blood, black bile,
yellow bile...

144
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,761
And phlegm.

145
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,674
Okay, break's over.

146
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,447
Lord Montgomery?

147
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,450
I've had some unforeseen
family medical expenses,

148
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:34,287
and I was wondering, could
I get an advance on my salary?

149
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,957
But first,
can I have a salary?

150
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,092
Peasants.

151
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,995
Serfson, you've pushed
that wheel around and around

152
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,698
for 20 years...
did you ever wonder why?

153
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,034
Mostly I just push it.

154
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,502
Have you ever noticed
that the wheel

155
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,003
isn't hooked up
to anything?

156
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,006
The rumors were true!

157
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,643
But your work does produce
something very special...

158
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,177
human misery...

159
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,346
which, when collected,
ground into a powder

160
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,717
and snorted, gives rich people
tiny wings that do nothing.

161
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:06,486
So if you help me,
it reduces my suffering,

162
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,389
which means less wing powder
for my betters.

163
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,958
I'm glad we
had this talk.

164
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,826
- But I really need the money...
- Flit-flit.

165
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,228
Thank you
for your time.

166
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,303
Hi, Azzlan.

167
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,905
Marge, my child.

168
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:28,876
I've come to offer solace
in this difficult time.

169
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,711
You mean convert me
to your religion

170
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,713
when I'm at my
most vulnerable?

171
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,982
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

172
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,051
I'm just here to ask you
an important question.

173
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,087
Have you heard the news?

174
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,489
Yes, yes.
I will be saved.

175
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,825
Thanks so much
for stopping by.

176
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,661
I'm just going to leave you with
this literature, praise God...

177
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,496
I can't go home
and face your mom

178
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,732
without the money
for that amulet.

179
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,233
In here.

180
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,236
Do you have your
lucky lead nugget?

181
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,771
Always.

182
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,406
A lead-lick a day

183
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,109
keeps the doctor a-blah...

184
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,622
Gold.
Sweet, sweet gold!

185
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,090
Why didn't you ever tell us
you could do magic?

186
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,760
Because if the king finds
out, he'll take me away

187
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,195
and force me to be one
of his evil wizards!

188
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,031
You necromancing nitwits!

189
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,934
I wanted an all-seeing eye,
not this!

190
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,271
No daughter of mine is gonna
end up in the hex trade.

191
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,440
Now, let's go
buy that amulet.

192
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,876
And don't worry,
mum's the word.

193
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,145
Did you say The Word?

194
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,983
- Hi, Azzlan.
- Hi, Azzlan.

195
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,552
12-nothing.

196
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,621
My serve.

197
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:50,624
You know, eventually,
you're gonna run out of us.

198
00:09:50,658 --> 00:09:52,626
I said, my serve.

199
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,729
Mom, I've got
a surprise for you.

200
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,497
Thanks to who?

201
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,634
I said it when I was 11,
and I'll say it now.

202
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,170
You're the greatest husband
in the world.

203
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,741
Where'd a dirt-poor
loser like you

204
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,843
get all the gold
for that?

205
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,144
Oh, well...

206
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,080
let's just say...

207
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,282
I strangled a leprechaun.

208
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,985
I'm not wearing that.

209
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,987
But without it,
you'll die.

210
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,489
- Fine by me.
- What?!

211
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,658
I want to die.

212
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:25,993
Oh, typical!

213
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,661
I want to live,
I want to die.

214
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,330
Just make up your mind...
they're both terrible.

215
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,767
Oh, I've lived a full life.

216
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,003
I saw a drawing of an ocean,

217
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:39,272
I watched my daughter
marry an ogre.

218
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,842
I am not an ogre.

219
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,610
My father married an ogre

220
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,247
after my mother was eaten
by a different ogre.

221
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,183
You're my mom.

222
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,053
I can't bear the thought
of saying good-bye.

223
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,061
You want me to live, I'll live.

224
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,802
Let's celebrate!

225
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,604
I'll roast a hobbit for dinner.

226
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,641
Bet you a packet

227
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,043
of South Farthing pipe weed
she picks me, Gaffer.

228
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,778
Hush now, lad.

229
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,447
The big folk will choose
who's tastiest and no mistake.

230
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,118
Hey! How do you know
you got them from me?

231
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,553
We miss you!

232
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,888
We miss you too!

233
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,056
Love you!

234
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,223
Love you more!

235
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,165
Is it really so bad
for Grandma if she dies?

236
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,433
Won't she spend eternity
in the Fields of Bliss?

237
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,305
Yeah. We're all going
to the Fields of Bliss...

238
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:48,241
where the days are passed
in frolic most joyous.

239
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,644
Just frolicking? That's it?

240
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:53,313
Sometimes, you wave
ribbons through the air.

241
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,982
But mainly, frolicking.

242
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,249
Doesn't that get old?

243
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,851
Did I mention the ribbons?

244
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,186
'Cause there's ribbons.

245
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,021
Fields of Bliss? Nonsense.

246
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,323
The afterlife is an
eternity of slaughtering

247
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,525
and being slaughtered
by your enemies.

248
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,760
Oh, yeah.

249
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,762
You're both wrong.
After death,

250
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,665
you spend all day counting
Goblin Jesus's money.

251
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,934
And it
better all be there.

252
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,268
71 mermaids.

253
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,037
Some where the fish
is the top part.

254
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,205
Top.

255
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,439
Mushrooms.

256
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,607
Everywhere, mushrooms.

257
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,443
Frolicking and ribbons!

258
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,447
Yeah, but what if
after we die, that's it?

259
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,049
We're just gone?

260
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,719
So just poof?

261
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,454
Really? Poof, and then
just super nothing?

262
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,625
Well, it's clean.
I'll give you that.

263
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,866
Oh, yeah.

264
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,068
This is way better
than death.

265
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,870
Come on, Mom.

266
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,372
There's so many things
we can say to each other now.

267
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,974
Oh, really?

268
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,809
Okay, then, say them.

269
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:56,977
I'm waiting.

270
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,513
Well...

271
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,815
What about you guys?

272
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,317
What do you want
to ask your grandma?

273
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,986
I got nothing.
I'm gonna take a stroll

274
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,687
and enjoy the golden age
of cleavage.

275
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,189
Lisa?

276
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,727
Oh! Well, Grandma,

277
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:16,196
tell us of your
most ardent swain.

278
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,565
I dated a shape-shifter once.

279
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,901
I thought I could
keep him from changing.

280
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,202
I was wrong.

281
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,404
Love is a fairy tale!

282
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:30,077
Every moment with her
is a precious gift.

283
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,345
Yes. Yes, it is.

284
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,014
All that matters
is that we're a family

285
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,548
and we're together.

286
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,859
Sorcerer-intendent
Chalmers.

287
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,929
Your daughter has been detected
using witchcraft.

288
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,264
Under the Magic
The Gathering Act,

289
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:55,035
she is hereby
property of the crown.

290
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,704
What? My daughter
isn't a magician.

291
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,807
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
but she is.

292
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,443
Yes, the moment that
she transmuted lead into gold,

293
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,278
our palantirs...
they just went bananas.

294
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,280
I've never seen palantirs
go so bananas.

295
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,049
It was the only way.

296
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,618
I just didn't want you
to be sad about Grandma.

297
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,621
Oh, no.
This is all my fault.

298
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,556
Don't blame
yourself, honey.

299
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,792
We're all at fault
for doing whatever it takes

300
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:20,493
to make you happy.

301
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,962
Help!

302
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,463
You can't nap my kid!

303
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,898
That's kidnapping!

304
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,333
Toenail Imprisonum!

305
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,503
D'oh!

306
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,005
Lisa's magic?

307
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,107
Maybe I'm magic too!

308
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,608
Abra-carumba!

309
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,811
Yeah, just grab a stick
and say a funny word.

310
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:39,947
Yeah, that's not
insulting to us at all.

311
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,614
Please don't
take my daughter.

312
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,184
She was only trying
to save her grandmother.

313
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,119
She sounds like
a wonderful kid.

314
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,555
Now please say good-bye
to her forever.

315
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,693
Take a peasant,
leave a peasant.

316
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:02,035
She's gone.
Lisa's gone.

317
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,871
Clip me out of here, Marge.
I'm gonna rescue Lisa

318
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,474
if I have to kill every
noble in that castle.

319
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,976
But Dad, serfs can't
rise up against nobles.

320
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,678
You'd be attacking
the system itself.

321
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,381
And nobody loves feudalism
more than you.

322
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,217
Son, feudalism
is a beautiful vision.

323
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,718
The Bill of No Rights.

324
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,987
One person, no vote.

325
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,223
But I'm willing
to betray all that

326
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,891
to get my daughter back.

327
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,527
Hey, you mind if
I dissolve those?

328
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,028
Just checking.

329
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,065
Better to ask.
Better to ask.

330
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,067
Peasants, peons,

331
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,069
and distinguished beggars!

332
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:41,741
Aren't you tired of the nobles
taking the wheat we sow,

333
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,543
the yarn we spin,

334
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,412
and the wine we steal

335
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,081
from travelers
we murder on the road?

336
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,749
They even take our children.

337
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,918
And not just
the worthless Barts,

338
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,221
but the magical Lisas.

339
00:15:57,224 --> 00:16:00,360
If we can put a
moon-spangled hat on a man,

340
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:05,232
why can't we kill a bunch of
rich jerks and take their stuff?!

341
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,382
How are we going to
get over these walls?

342
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,217
Walls...

343
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,085
cannot stop us.

344
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,055
The trees will fight with you.

345
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,824
We will never
forget your sacrifice.

346
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,926
Sacrifice?

347
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,629
We could have torn down

348
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,799
the castle walls
in five minutes.

349
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,670
Trees can't talk, silly.

350
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,417
Mom!

351
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,420
Dad! Help!

352
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,655
Milhouses,
save your girlfriend!

353
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,591
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

354
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,125
Okay, no...

355
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,596
I'm just a friend
who is a girl.

356
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,798
It's something to build on.

357
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:19,206
You peasants are a drag-on
the economy.

358
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,341
Oh! I get it.

359
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,710
Because he's riding a dragon!

360
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,516
My love for wordplay
is undiminished!

361
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,322
Oh, no!
We're losing.

362
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,024
We need to talk.

363
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,193
- Now?
- Yes, now.

364
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,695
It's time for me to go.

365
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,997
Life is about moving forward.

366
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,167
Girls want to be women,
women want to be mothers,

367
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,136
mothers want to be grandmas,

368
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,373
and grandmas
want to know what comes next.

369
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,342
But what if
I'm not ready?

370
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,011
I wouldn't leave you if I didn't
know you'll be all right.

371
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,916
Okay, Mom.
I understand.

372
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,887
Maybe I was born a peasant,

373
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,189
but I'm going out
an ice queen.

374
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,089
Now we won!

375
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,563
My mom gave her life
to save ours.

376
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,465
Take comfort, Marge.

377
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,234
Now she's in
the Fields of Bliss.

378
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,737
No, she's in
Goblin Money Heaven.

379
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,307
The afterlife is snakes
chewing your eyes,

380
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,974
but it feels good.

381
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,610
This is our heaven!

382
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,615
Or, as long as Grandma
lives on in our hearts,

383
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,617
then she's
never truly gone.

384
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,118
Until we die.

385
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,586
Then it's like
she never existed.

386
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,089
And, someday,
no one will remember you.

387
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,258
Or anybody.

388
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,128
All is well...
the nobles are defeated,

389
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,663
the dragon is dead,

390
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,831
and I've got a daughter

391
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,166
who can turn lead into gold!

392
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,603
Ooh. Actually,
I can't anymore.

393
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,306
Dragon fire is the
source of all magic.

394
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,141
And Grandma killed
the last one.

395
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,977
Everything wondrous and
extraordinary about our world

396
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,812
is going to fade.

397
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,317
But maybe now we can use science
to improve our world.

398
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,018
With new technologies,

399
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,955
we can put an end
to poverty and disease.

400
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,457
Sure, it'll be hard work,

401
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,525
but far more rewarding
than waving your hand

402
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,827
over a rock
to change it into gold.

403
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,162
I mean...

404
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,197
Please come back, magic!

405
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,168
Live, damn you, live.

406
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:08,375
I am risen!

407
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,842
But what about science?

408
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,678
Oh, sweetie, who would

409
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,846
want to live in a world
without magic?

410
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,548
It would be so boring.

411
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:18,351
People would have to make up
fantasy stories...

412
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,520
Most of them poorly
written pretenses

413
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,689
for explicit sex
and violence.

414
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,725
Just to escape
the tedious real world.

415
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,160
That does sound awful.

416
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,296
Look! The dragon is
burning our village.

417
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:34,333
I love our life.

418
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,351
<i>Dry your tears</i>

419
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:55,187
<i>A journey's end</i>

420
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:58,357
<i>The saga's done</i>

421
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,193
<i>We part as friends</i>

422
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:05,532
<i>We must away</i>

423
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,867
<i>We cannot tarry</i>

424
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,036
<i>The minstrel's burden</i>

425
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:13,573
<i>Is ours to carry</i>

426
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,742
<i>All other stories</i>

427
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,678
<i>Will ever pale</i>

428
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,414
<i>For we have sung</i>

429
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:26,118
<i>The perfect tale</i>
