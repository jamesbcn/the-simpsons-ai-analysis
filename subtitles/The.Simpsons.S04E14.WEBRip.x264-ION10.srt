a bad father.

135
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,722
Marge, when kids these days
say bad, they mean good,

136
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,681
and to shake your booty means
to wiggle one's butt.

00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,845

talk to Bart about--

139
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,353

140
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,774

an explanation for this bill?

141
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,938
Oh, it's that record club.

143

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,880
for about 20 minutes.

182
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,632
If you get bored,
here's a MASH coloring book.

183
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,594
Here's a good one.

184
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,505
"Hawkeye's antics irritate
the other surgeons."

185
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,264
(chuckling)

186
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,107
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>
<i>the Corey Hotline.</i>

187
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,899
<i>$4.95 a minute.</i>

188
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,653
<i>Here are some words</i>
<i>that rhyme with Corey:</i>

189
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,405
<i>Glory, story...</i>

190
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,328
-(sighs)
<i>-... allegory, Montessori...</i>

191
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,659
(grunting)

192
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:44,625
Okay, Bart, tomorrow
we'll blast your quads.

193
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,299
<i>This meatball soup</i>
<i>is delicious, Stimpy.</i>

194
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,129
<i>That's not meatball soup.</i>

195
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,224
<i>That's my collection of</i>
<i>furballs in stomach acid.</i>

196
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,761
<i>(siren screeching)</i>

197
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,715
<i>You idiot!</i>

198
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,715
<i>You're trying</i>
<i>to kill me, man!</i>

199
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,192
Someday I want to be
an F-14 pilot,

200
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,935
like my hero, Tom.

201
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,657
He lent me this new weapon
called a neural disrupter.

202
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,488
(choking and sputtering)

203
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,155
(kids applauding)

204
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,953
He's not dead,
is he, Bart?

205
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,367
{\an8}Nah, but I wouldn't give him
any homework for a while.

206
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,616
Very good, Bart.

207
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,247
-Thank you.
-Oh, don't thank me.

208
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,254
Thank an unprecedented
eight-year military buildup.

209
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,336
Mmm. Milhouse, you're next.

210
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,592
Uh, I have a horsey.

211
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,184
(feeble neighing imitation)

212
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,257
Wuss!

213
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,889
Lisa, I'm glad you came.

214
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,555
I know you young'uns think
we old-timers aren't any fun,

215
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,686
but we'll show them.

216
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,523
We'll show them all!

217
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,358
(laughing)

218
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,533
(snoring)

219
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,702
(gasps)

220
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,618
<i>Hi, this is Corey.</i>

221
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,079
<i>I hope you and I can</i>
<i>get married someday.</i>

222
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,870
Hey, boy,
where you going?

223
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,464
Father-son picnic.

224
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,459
Have a good time.

225
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,791
Hey, wait a minute.

226
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,247
Lisa, I know I can
trust you

227
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,048
to inventory this
glee club peanut brittle.

228
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,551
Yes, Principal Skinner.

229
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,723
Now, I've got to slash
40% out of the budget.

230
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,853
So long... doo-doo-doo-
doo-doo-doo...

231
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,641
Science.

232
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,564
Ah, music and art.

233
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,943
(phone dialing)

234
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,439
What in blazes?

235
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,401
(beeping and ringing)

236
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,481
Good lord.

237
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,185
That's a 900 number.

238
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,315
COREY: <i>Let's see</i>
<i>what's in the newspaper today.</i>

239
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,994
<i>-(paper rustling)</i>
<i>-Hmm...</i>

240
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,832
<i>"Canada stalls</i>
<i>on trade pact."</i>

241
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,328
(phone disconnects)

242
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,540
(gasps)

243
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,537
Hey, look at that
forest fire down there.

244
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,047
-Yeah, great.
-What's the matter?

245
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,220
Well, I've been thinking.
You've been really great to me,

246
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,089
but there's probably
some other kid

247
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,546
who needs you even more.

248
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,216
Bart, I could kiss you,

249
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,274
if the bigger brothers hadn't
made me sign a form

250
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,138
promising I wouldn't.

251
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,385
No one needs me more

252
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,596
than a child with your
tragic upbringing.

253
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,227
Now, let's set down
at that frogurt stand.

254
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,742
So, that's it.

255
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,370
Hello, son.

256
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,004
Where have you been?

257
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,170
Playing with Milhouse.

258
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,418
No, you haven't.

259
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,919
You've been out
gallivanting around

260
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,711
with that floozy of a
bigger brother of yours,

261
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,844
haven't you?
Haven't you?

262
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,471
Look at me.

263
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,298
{\an8}Dad, it just kind
of happened.

264
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,633
{\an8}You're taking this
too hard.

265
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,298
How would you like me
to take it?

266
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,306
"Go ahead, Bart.
Have your fun.

267
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,058
I'll be waiting for you."

268
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,480
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

269
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,309
Well, what are you
going to do?

270
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,443
Oh, you'll see.

271
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,574
And what are your reasons
for wanting a little brother?

272
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,862
{\an8}<i>(thinking)</i>
<i>Don't say revenge, don't say revenge.</i>

273
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,866
Uh... revenge?

274
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,078
{\an8}<i>(thinking) That's it.</i>
<i>I'm getting out of here.</i>

275
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,869
{\an8}(running footsteps
and door slamming)

276
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,659
Welcome aboard,
Mr. Simpson.

277
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,128
Any of these boys
would be thrilled

278
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,842
to have a bigger brother
like you.

279
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,762
Ugly, wiener,
crater-face.

280
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,972
Sooey!
Sooey!

281
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,767
Eh, maybe this
was a mistake.

282
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,888
{\an8}Do you have a bigger
brother for me yet?

283
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,396
{\an8}Okay, I'll be back
in an hour.

284
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,158
(crying)

285
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,781
I'll take him.

286
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,367
Do you have him in blond?

287
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:53,122
Lisa, the only way you'll lick
this is one day at a time.

288
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,787
If you can make it to midnight
without calling the Corey line,

289
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,917
you'll know
you've beaten it forever.

290
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,094
LISA: Midnight?

291
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,052
Listen to your mother, Lisa.

292
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,512
I owe everything I have
to my mother's watchful eye

293
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,644
and swift hand.

294
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,059
Oh, there's mother now...

295
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,141
-(crow cawing)
-...watching me.

296
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,347
What's that, mother?

297
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,807
They have a right
to be here.

298
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,187
It's school business.
I--

299
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,696
Mother, that sailor suit
doesn't fit anymore.

300
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,818
I think we should go.

301
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,164
Uh-huh.

302
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,199
-(siren wailing)
-(distant gunshots)

303
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,159
(snoring)

304
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,164
Heh heh heh.
Just like Oscar the Grouch.

305
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,590
-Pepe!
-Papa Homer!

306
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,011
Son, your life is going
to get better starting now.

307
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,471
(clunk)
Oh!

308
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,845
Your son Bart sounds
very bad.

309
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,509
Oh, he is.

310
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,348
Son, I just want you to know
I love you very much.

311
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,635
Shut up!

312
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,478
Mmm, grapefruit.

313
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:04,986
I just press this button
and the door opens like magic.

314
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,700
Why does it stop there?

315
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,163
Because it's a stupid
piece of junk!

316
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,794
Bart! Bart! Aah!

317
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,713
Well, I'd better
get you home.

318
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,081
What's the matter?

319
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,088
I've spent every night
of my life in the city.

320
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,381
I have never seen
the stars.

321
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,255
PEPE: Tell me more.

322
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,182
I want to know
all the constellations.

323
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,431
Well, there's...

324
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,433
Jerry the Cowboy.

325
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,055
And that big
dipper-looking thing

326
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,023
is Alan... the Cowboy.

327
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,114
Oh, Papa Homer,
you are so learn-ed.

328
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,781
(chuckles)
Learned, son.

329
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,820
It's pronounced "Learned."

330
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,864
I love you, Papa Homer.

331
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,658
I love you too, Pepsi.

332
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,161
-Pepe.
-Pepe.

333
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,992
{\an8}(thinking) <i>Got to</i>
<i>make it till midnight.</i>

334
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,248
{\an8}<i>Got to make it</i>
<i>till midnight.</i>

335
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,080
(ringing)

336
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,747
(ticking)

337
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,665
(knitting needles clicking)

338
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,303
(ticking, clicking
and ringing grow louder)

339
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,767
(ticking, clicking
and ringing grow louder)

340
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,450
Must you be forever
dialing that phone?!

341
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,663
Excuse me.

342
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,417
Oh, come on.

343
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,958
Hurry.

344
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,959
Lisa?

345
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,886
Oh, Lisa.

346
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,601
You tried your best.

347
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,152
At the tone, the time
will be 12:00 midnight.

348
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,098
(tone)

349
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,443
I made it.

350
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,608
<i>♪ ...and Scratchy show ♪</i>

351
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,125
(screams)

352
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,439
Hey, Homer, have you
seen my skateboard?

353
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,189
I gave it to Pepe.

354
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,691
Who the hell is Pepe?

355
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,443
He's my little brother.

356
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,364
That's right.
You're not the only one

357
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,533
who can abuse
a nonprofit organization.

358
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,032
Who needs you?
Tom's a better father than you ever were.

359
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,615
Come on, Bart,
we had our fun.

360
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,831
Remember when I used
to push you on the swing?

361
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,542
I was faking it.

362
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,792
(gasps) Liar!

363
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,213
Oh, yeah?
Remember this?

364
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,921
Higher, Dad, higher.

365
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,461
-Whee!
-Hey!

366
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,094
-Stop that!
-Push harder Dad, c'mon.

367
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,171
-Higher, higher, faster!
-Stop it!

368
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,925
Stop it!
Stop it!

369
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,889
You know, the whale
is not really a fish.

370
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,057
They're mammals,
like you and me.

371
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,266
Is that true?

372
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,516
Pfft. No.

373
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,777
(dolphin squealing)

374
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,662
Whoo!
Heh heh heh!

375
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,818
Come and get it.

376
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,406
Whoo!
Heh heh heh!

377
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,042
Come and get it.

378
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,039
Whoo!
Heh heh heh!

379
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,750
Stupid dolphin.

380
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,670
Hey! Hey!

381
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,418
(dolphin squealing)

382
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,041
HOMER:
He got my hot dog!

383
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,207
(Homer grunting)

384
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,966
Uh-oh, better not
let him see me.

385
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,338
What the--

386
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,014
Oh, it's you.

387
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,809
So...

388
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,232
you're looking well.

389
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,520
Come on, Bart,

390
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,193
you know better than to
talk to strangers.

391
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,692
For your information,
I'm his father.

392
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,275
His father?

393
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,860
The drunken gambler?

394
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,855
That's right,
and who might you be?

395
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,834
Hi-yah!

396
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,662
(karate yells)

397
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,964
(karate yells)

398
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,004
There you go, fellas.

399
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:31,956
D'oh!

400
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,130
Look, there's another
disadvantaged boy.

401
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:36,966
Where?

402
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,845
Grr.

403
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,678
There's a couple of guys
fighting at the aquarium, chief.

404
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,434
Do they still sell
those frozen bananas?

405
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,726
-I think so.
-Let's roll.

406
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,600
This just in.

407
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,267
A fistfight is in progress
in downtown Springfield.

408
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,186
Early reports indicate, and
these are very preliminary,

409
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,906
that one of the fighters
is a giant lizard.

410
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,278
Do we have a source on this?

411
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,365
Uh-huh. A bunch of
drunken frat boys.

412
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,201
All right, I could
use some names.

413
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,746
I.P. Freely.
L-- Oh!

414
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,921
{\an8}(punch landing)

415
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,508
(grunting wildly)

416
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,800
(glass shattering)

417
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,974
(Homer grunting,
glass shattering)

418
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,183
Uh, Homer?

419
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,095
Oh, right.

420
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,895
(echoed screaming)

421
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,697
(screaming grows louder)

422
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,405
(crack)

423
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,497
{\an8}This is even more painful
than it looks.

424
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,253
This is all my fault, Dad.

425
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,125
I didn't want you
to get hurt.

426
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,129
Now I need to find
another little brother.

427
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,926
{\an8}And I need to find
another big brother.

428
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,350
My car's going to feel
so empty on the ride home.

429
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,719
{\an8}And me, I have
no ride at all.

430
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,268
I already bought
a giant ham for dinner.

431
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,692
It's gonna go to waste.

432
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,940
{\an8}Don't talk about food.
I'm so hungry.

433
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,733
-Well, good-bye.
-Well, good-bye.

434
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,067
{\an8}Wait, I've got an idea.

435
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,652
{\an8}-An idea?
-Huh?

436
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,002
BART: Another beer, Dad?

437
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,007
Thanks, son.

438
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,379
Dad, remember when Tom
had you in that headlock,

439
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,546
and you screamed,
"I'm a hemophiliac"?

440
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,965
And when he let you go,
you kicked him in the back?

441
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,604
(chuckles)
Yeah.

442
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,431
Will you teach me
how to do that.

443
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,266
Sure, boy.

444
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,901
First, you've got
to shriek like a woman

445
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,069
and keep sobbing till
he turns away in disgust.

446
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,149
That's when it's time
to kick some back.

447
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,949
HOMER: And then when
he's lying out on the ground...

448
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,411
-BART: Yeah?
-...kick him in the ribs...

449
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,030
-BART: Yeah?
-...and step on his neck.

450
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,327
{\an8}-BART: Yeah?
-HOMER: And run like hell.

00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,661
