Homie,
what are you drinking?

85
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:58,403
A surprisingly not-horrible
fruit drink called a mimosa.

86
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,068
There's champagne in those!

87
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,327

Then there's champagne in me!

88
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,039
Oh, what am I gonna do?

89
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,289
It's less than 24 hours
till my drug test!

90
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,832
Maybe I can sweat it out.

91
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,245
(grunting, panting)

92
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,254
Oh, man, I'd better have
some coffee and iced tea.

93
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,087
No!
Irish and Long Island!

94
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,053
What about this lemonade?

95
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,432
Mike's Hard!

96
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,099
Then I better soak up
the alcohol with some food!

97
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,258
-Whoo! Cake!
-Rum cake!

98
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,636
-Crepes!
-Suzette!

104
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,953
Wow,
passed with flying colors!

105
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,530
I've sure earned this!

106
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,837
O, Lord,
I have once again besotted

107
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,589
my liver with
Thy fermented gifts.

108
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,921
If You can weasel me out
of this physical,

109
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,047
I will blow Your mind
by doing something

110
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,054
incredibly holy,
at some point. Amen.

111
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,557
Now to mumble
in a religious fashion.

112
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,098
Dear God, O, Lord,
O, God, O, Lord...

113

O, Lord, O, God,
O, Lord Almighty.

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,809
Hm...

00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,897
your cells have been
overexposed to gamma radiation.

117
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,034
Like the Hulk?

118
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,700
Well,
sort of like the Hulk.

119
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,988
But instead of getting powerful,

120
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,031
you're going to get
very, very sick.

121
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,695
(moans)

122
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,043
Hulk smash...

123
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:31,248
Yes, Hulk smash.
(chuckles)

124
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,921
Mr. Burns, you are liable

125
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,169
for thousands
of dollars per employee,

126
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,091
not to mention
my extensive fees which...

127
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,591
(screams)

128
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,172
This trapdoor app
works like a charm.

129
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,927
Excellent.

130
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,679
LAWYER:
You'll still have to pay!

131
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,011
(sighs)

132
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,805
This is the last time
I pay the price

133
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,269
for the irritating mortality
of the human worker.

134
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,230
Smithers,
it's time to re-staff with

135
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,690
the super-intelligent
kangaroos we've been breeding!

136
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,441
I'm sorry, sir, but they
just filled their pouches

137
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,272
with office supplies
and hopped away.

138
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,688
Even the joeys?

139
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,146
You know, sir, there is
a more high-tech solution.

140
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,276
More high-tech
than kangaroos?

141
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,781
Ladies and gentlemen,

142
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,196
meet the future masters
of the human race.

143
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,445
(<i>Night on Bald Mountain</i> playing)

144
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,711
(shrieks)
Comicon nerds!

145
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,753
You fool!
These are robots!

146
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,206
You will train them

147
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,716
and they will replace you.

148
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,220
I give you permission to shake
your fists in anger twice.

149
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,973
(employees growl twice)

150
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,765
I didn't say, Monty Says.

151
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,138
Now I have cause
to terminate.

152
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,345
-(angry muttering)
-LENNY: This is crap.

153
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,194
-Now get out.
-You didn't say Monty Says.

154
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,440
This is no game!

155
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,317
Excellent.

156
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,525
Sir, I'm afraid we do need
to keep one human worker--

157
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,076
to sign for packages,
a scapegoat for meltdowns,

158
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
things that would be
a waste of the robots' time.

159
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,916
(groans) So we need one
meat sock on the payroll.

160
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,879
-But who?
-Mr. Burns, before I leave,

161
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,671
I got a few things
to get off my chest.

162
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,675
One, I like the new microwave
in the break room.

163
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,838
Just push "popcorn," you don't
have to know how long.

164
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,847
Two, replacing us with robots
is heartless and despicable.

165
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,811
Three, how about a farewell
party with a caricature artist?

166
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,772
You know, it's something both
kids and adults can enjoy.

167
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,864
So, to sum up:
nicely done,

168
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,279
we hate you,
and food for thought.

169
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,188
Simpson, wait!

170
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,357
As it turns out,
there is one job available.

171
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,866
But be forewarned,
it promises naught

172
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,118
but soul-crushing boredom.

173
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,330
Does the chair go back
like this?

174
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,870
-Yes.

I'm playing for ya?

00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,155
That could've been
my motherboard

352
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,496
lying in the street!

353
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,041
<i>Our primary directive...</i>

354
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,835
<i>is to preserve human life.</i>

355
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,050
And here I was
waiting till you slept

356
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,920
to rob you of your copper.

357
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,337
You know, it's crazy, but...

358
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,085
<i>Homer, move away from me.</i>

359
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,677
<i>You are still in the road.</i>

360
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,352
Hush, bionic prince,
as I cradle your waning form.

361
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,308
Such a peaceful end.

362
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,274
(high-pitched
electronic screams)

363
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,784
Oh, geez!

364
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,068
-(horn honking)
-Get out of the road!

365
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,072
-(horn honks)
-Hey!

366
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,744
(horn blares)

367
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,242
-(horn honks)
-You stupid jerk!

368
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,494
-(horn beeping)
-(man shouts angrily)

369
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,670
(Lisa plays slow,
melancholy blues melody)

370
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,051
Axles to axles,

371
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,258
rust to rust, amen.

372
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,339
-Amen.
-Amen.

373
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,093
Dearly beloved, we are not here

374
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,006
to mourn their deactivation,

375
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,755
but to celebrate
their period of function.

376
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,177
Can I hollow out this one's head
and use it as a turtle tank?

377
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,687
No! I'm already using
it to put my keys in.

378
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,860
Now, let me
raise this beer to toast...

379
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,189
(shrieks)
What the...?

380
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,363
<i>Alcohol is harmful to humans.</i>

381
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,032
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
save your breath.

382
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,201
<i>We have no breath.</i>

383
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,108
<i>We do vent nitrogen</i>
<i>once a year.</i>

384
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,527
<i>You do not want</i>
<i>to be around for that.</i>

385
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,536
D'oh! I have some
adjustments to make.

386
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,035
Homer...

387
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,963
when am I getting
my power drill back?

388
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,291
When I'm done
with my robo-botomies.

389
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,048
<i>Primary directive deactivated.</i>

390
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,633
<i>Our new primary directive</i>

391
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,048
<i>becomes removing</i>
<i>all impediments to the plant.</i>

392
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,562
Uh, Homer, I'm afraid this is the part
of God's perfect plan

393
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,141
where you're
murdered by robots.

394
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,766
Flanders,
I don't judge a robot

395
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,023
by the color of their eyes,
I look at their hands...

396
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,646
which have turned
into buzz saws.

397
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,901
(screams)

398
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,567
Son of a...!
Why did you do that?

399
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,156
(muttering)

400
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,332
<i>ROBOTS:</i>
<i>Eliminate impediment. Eliminate...</i>

401
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,833
Just say "kill me," jerks!

402
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,325
<i>ROBOTS:</i>
<i>Kill him. Kill him.</i>

403
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,497
Dad, they can only go
three miles an hour!

404
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,837
I'm doomed!
Can they climb stairs?

405
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,512
With great difficulty.

406
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,591
I'm doomed!

407
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,519
(knocking on door)

408
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,056
(panting)
Robots... trying to kill me.

409
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,935
And now they'll kill you,
'cause I led them here!

410
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,033
Now see here!
You are so not

411
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,571
the heartless automatons
I was looking for.

412
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,775
There's one thing man has
that machines can never match:

413
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,787
hounds!

414
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,949
(snarling)

415
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,368
(yelps)

416
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,826
(all whining)

417
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,746
Fine, slink away.
And guess what?

418
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,964
All those times I said
"you're a good boy,"

419
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,045
it was a lie!

420
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,799
(growling, barking)

421
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,671
No, stop!
I'll give you the combination

422
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,718
to the num-num safe!

423
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,051
(growling)

424
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,385
Flee, you fool!

425
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,390
Aren't we getting num-nums?

426
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,102
(shuddering)

427
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,056
(dogs barking)

428
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,476
Ah. The solarium.

429
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,645
We'll be safely cornered
in this glass room

430
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,824
with one door.

431
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,834
(grunts)

432
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,410
Stop brandishing me.

433
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,035
Sorry.
Before we die,

434
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,372
can you tell me
how old you really are?

435
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,247
-Well, it has four digits...
-(crash)

436
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,585
Unemployed Springfielders
to the rescue!

437
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,011
And underemployed.

438
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,677
To servos with love.

439
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,900
Guys, thank you.

440
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,114
The words "prime directive"

441
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,073
get thrown around
a lot these days,

442
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,114
but I'm glad yours
was saving me.

443
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,987
The saddest part is:

444
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,664
none of this had to happen.

445
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,122
If Mr. Burns
had simply trusted

446
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,833
the human worker.

447
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,753
Or if someone,
anyone, had told me

448
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,423
that robots were
incapable of human feelings.

449
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,763
<i>I told you precisely</i>
<i>that fact 1,562...</i>

450
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,222
(laughs)

451
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,965
And his arm
can be my back-scratcher.

452
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,266
(electricity buzzes,
Homer screams)

453
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,889
Well, I've learned
the robotic worker is no match

454
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,267
for the old-fashioned
man of labor.

455
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,984
You're all hired back...
as temps.

456
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,275
(workers cheering)

457
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,528
<i>ROBOT: Homer, why have you</i>
<i>reprogrammed me for this?</i>

458
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,202
I'm giving you your wish:

459
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,370
to be a real boy.

460
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,949
<i>I am real</i>
<i>and I do not have wishes.</i>

461
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,615
Then take us out to sea!

00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,003
<i>I am not a transformer.</i>

463
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,039
<i>I cannot turn into</i>
<i>an outboard motor.</i>

464
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,083
Oh, I believe you,

465
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,787
