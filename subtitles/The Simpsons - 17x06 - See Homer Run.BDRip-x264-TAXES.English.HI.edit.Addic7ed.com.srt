Oh, I didn't know salamanders
could do all those things.

346
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,124
And to think, for all these
years I've been a gecko man.

347
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,049
Take a hike, jerk.
(SQUEAKS)

348
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,123
Mister Simpson,
what about those photos

349
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,123
of you strangling
your child?

350
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,041
Why should we let
this election be influenced

351
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,849
by a photo
taken hours ago?

352
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,485
(CHEERING)

353
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,124
Now restaurant matchbooks
for everyone!

354
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,489
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Salamander! Salamander!

355
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,406
Homer, you're doing great.
You're way ahead in the polls.

356
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,847
Even those negative campaign
ads aren't hurting you.

357
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,526
<i>Simpson barely even comes
in to work anymore.</i>

358
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,489
<i>He pays a homeless man
to do it for him.</i>

359
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,803
<i>I, um... I don't
feel so good, Blue.</i>

360
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,243
(CHUCKLES) Hey, people may
not love Homer Simpson

361
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,890
but they love this suit.

362
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,649
Just like they love
their stupid American flag.

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,331
(HOMER GULPING)

364
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,687
Oh, what's that smell?

365
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,482
It's the smell of impending victory.
(RETCHES)

366
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,130
Did you just vomit
in that suit?

367
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,326
A little.

368
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,481
Oh.

369
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,485
Have you cleaned that suit
once since you got it?

370
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,880
No. But I swam in it.

371
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,281
Ugh. I better
wash that thing.

372
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,840
It's hard to know where the
suit ends and you begin.

373
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah.

374
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,084
But aren't you gonna
have fun finding out?

375
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,286
No!

376
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,841
(CLUCKING)

377
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,971
That's weird...
Started off as an egg.

378
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,806
KENT: Our next question
goes to Eleanor Abernathy.

379
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,531
Also known as
the Crazy Cat Lady.

380
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,449
Uh, Cat Lady,
how would you boost

381
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,010
the city's commercial
tax base?

382
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,447
(BABBLING)

383
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,487
Small business incentives,

384
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,369
(YELLING INCOHERENTLY)

385
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,690
corporate accountability.-.

386
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,764
Cats in everyone's pants!

387
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,048
All right. Thank you, Cat Lady.
See you in the spin room.

388
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,244
Okay. Okey-dokey.
(YELLS) Yeah.

389
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,126
Our next question
is for the Safety Salamander.

390
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,361
(CROWD CHEERING)

391
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,850
Sir, how would you restore our
city's crumbling infrastructure?

392
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,480
That's an excellent question, Kent.
First of all...

393
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,050
What the... Must have shrunk
when my wife washed it.

394
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,489
Why, without his costume,
he's naught but a man!

395
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,848
Hey, screw this. I'm not gonna let
any human tell me what to do.

396
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,560
That's right. lam a man.

397
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,688
The man who dressed
like a salamander

398
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,001
to win back
his daughter's love.

399
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,531
Let's meet her now!

400
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,569
Uh, well, my son is here, too.
Let's meet him now.

401
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,091
BART: Here's Bart!

402
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,842
What's up?
Boring!

403
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,241
We're sick of you
and your hatchlings!

404
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,771
(CROWD BOOING)

405
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,283
Please stop throwing fruit!

<i>attained the 5%
necessary to win.</i>

410

<i>And Mayor Joe Quimby will keep his
job, which I didn't want anyway.</i>

411
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,364
<i>Your loss, jackasses.</i>

412

(SIGHING)

413
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,844
Well, Dad, you tried to
make this town a better place.

414
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,891
And no matter what,
that makes you my hero.

415
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,281
Aw, thanks. Now how about
a dance with your daddy?

416
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,089
I can't believe
I lost after Ben Affleck

417
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,128
campaigned
day and night for me.

418
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,487
LISA: Yeah, I warned you
about that.

419
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,171
Whoops!
Be careful of my tail!

420
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,208
You don't have a tail anymore.

421
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,965
You know, I...
I still feel it.

422
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,765
It's so itchy.
