People are wearing
terrycloth bathrobes

367
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,245
like they're ancient Romans.

368
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,423
Actually,
more like Macedonians.

369
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,841
All right, come on,
deer and pig.

370
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,260
It's time for you to mate
and then fight to the death.

What happened
to this place?

372

Oh, uh, Krusty cut his losses

373
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,394
by partnering with
Caligula's World Family Entertainment.

374
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,596
They redid the whole place
as an adult spa.

375
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,357
Uh-oh.
Did I leave my sash on?

376
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,940

430
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,244

Did he have a red vest?

-Yes!
-Yes!

Can you kids keep a secret?

452
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,099
I can, but Lisa can't.

453
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,935

in confidence!

455
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,106
And a man, I might add--
a very short man.

456
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,156
They'd like to be called
"little people."

457
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,950
Yeah, not that much.

458
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,832
