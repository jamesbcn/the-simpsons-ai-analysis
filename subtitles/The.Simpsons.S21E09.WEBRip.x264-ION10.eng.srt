00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,632
He thinks he's a pack.

352
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,208
-(barking)
-(yells)

353
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,297
Where'd you get
this rope?

354
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,340
Swiped it
from gym class.

355
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,922
Climb that rope!

356
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,220
There is no rope.

357
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,392
Well, you better get
to the ceiling somehow!

358
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,601
(panting)

359
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,271
-Ceiling, ceiling, ceiling!
-(grunts)

360
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,639
(groaning)

361
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,346
Bart, I'm losing my grip.

362
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,766
Put the rope in your teeth.

363
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,435
What will that do?

364
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,823
It'll shut you up.

365
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,779
(grunts)

366
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,860
Hmm.

367
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,244
Larry?

368
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,610
Larry the Lamb?

369
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,238
There you are,
you piece of crap.

370
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,485
-(growling)
-(yells)

371
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,537
There's rats
in my pants!

372
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,250
Chief, my brother fell
in the storm drain!

373
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,711
Um, I'm strictly an
above-the-ground policeman.

374
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,713
What you need is
the sewer cops.

375
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,835
Fine. What's their number?

376
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,051
Lisa, you're old enough now

377
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,671
that I can tell you
the truth.

378
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,887
There's no such thing
as the sewer cops.

379
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,718
It's just something we tell kids
to make them feel safe.

380
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,064
What about Bart?

381
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,849
Well, if you miss him,
yell into a toilet.

382
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,306
BART (echoing):
It's dark down here!

383
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,646
I have a column
I'd like to submit.

384
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,944
Pay me whenever.

385
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,107
I'll just take this
to our editor.

386
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,331
(shredder whirring)

387
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,828
Hmm.

388
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,583
What?

389
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,747
Pulitzer Prize application form?

390
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:25,837
"When I rode with Abe Simpson
on the <i>Tinseltown Starliner,</i>

391
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,595
I never dreamed his first
voyage would be his last?

392
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,638
At 3:00 on Monday,

393
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,852
Abe passed away peacefully
in his sleep."

394
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,901
How would he know
Grampa was going to die today?

395
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,859
Unless he was going to kill him!

396
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,731
But would someone
really kill a man

397
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,777
just to win a Pulitzer Prize?

398
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,031
(music plays dramatic sting)

399
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,699

All aboard the final run
of the <i>Tinseltown Starliner,</i>

401
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,594
the last ride
into a nostalgic past.

402
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,634
Anyone without a ticket
will be beaten

403
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,837

408

409
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,026
Ow!

410
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,439
I'm finally riding
the <i>Tinseltown Starliner.</i>

411
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,908
I could die a happy man.

412

D'oh!

416
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,384
Drink up, Abe.

417
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,755
Live each moment as if
someone's about to kill you.

418
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,974
I mean,
as if it's your last.

419
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,394
Sorry, my hearing aid's
on the fritz.

420
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,023
The only word
I heard was "kill."

421
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,101
(Homer whimpering)

422
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,935
Hey. Aah.

423
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,186
Look at that.

424
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,276
They've recreated the '30s.

425
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,951
Tent cities,
failing banks.

426
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,241
No, those are real.

427
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,533

Oh!

430
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,825
HOMER:
Beware of Marshall Goldman!

431
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,373
What was that?

432
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,537
Um, an elephant
on a circus train

433
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,875
bellowing for
his mother.

434
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,630
Oh, I remember the first time

435
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,673
an elephant tried to eat me
like a peanut.

436
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,758
I was on the set
of a Warner Brothers cartoon.

437
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,554
Jack Warner came by
and said...

438
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,517
(whimpering)

439
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,309
Hey, Slimu!

440
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,692

441
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,309
Huh?

442
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,766
(laughs)

443
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,776
Yeah, you'd better run!

444
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,028

445
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,359

450
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,659
(yowling)

451
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,333
Larry, you saved my life!

452
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,871
You're the most wonderful
stuffed lamb in the world.

453
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,285
I'm sorry
about the mean things I said,

454
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,333
and we'll have the rest
of the weekend to...

455
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,127
Whoa!

456
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,671
(grunts)

457
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,174
Huh?

Man, everybody
loves this guy.

461
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,219
Give him my number.

462
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,433
I'll teach him things.

463
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,393
Things he can use.

00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,523
(train whistle blows)

465
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,601
The older I get,

466
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,396
the more I like the taste
of hot water.

And your father's
gonna make me a fortune.

Pathetic old fool.

00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,079

So many hat boxes.

494
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,589
Dad, I don't have
the right words

495
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,506
to say how I really feel
about you,

496
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,925
but at least I know
how to beat up a guy who does.

497
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,305
Well, at least
you never tried to kill me.

498
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,653
Just with indifference.

499
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,860
You did good, kid.

500
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,859
This is for the shoeshine.

501
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,111
It's a ghost quarter,

502
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,113
but you'll be able
to spend it pretty soon.

503
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,365
So, Grampa,
you really saved Dad's life?

504
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,869
I sure did.

505
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,700
But why don't we let Homer
tell the story?

506
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,866
Really? Me? You mean it?

507
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,825
I think you're ready
for your first ramble.

508
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,627
Oh, I've been waiting
for this day for so long.

509
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,921
The year is 1946.

510
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,425
In a war-torn world,
a single flower blooms.

511
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:22,218
And that flower is an angry
Japanese monster named Godzilla.

512
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,644
How am I doing, Dad?

513
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,022
I'm hanging
on every word.

514
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,689
Fortunately, there was
one man who could help--

515
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,269
Colonel Tom Parker.

516
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,814
The Colonel took this monster,
cleaned him up

517
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,728
and put him onstage
under the name

518
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,856
The Rolling Stones.

519
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,204
The first concert was a sellout

520
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,738
with many, many,
many people eaten.

521
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,662
But those that survived raved
about the undeniable harmonies

522
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,123
and brutally honest lyrics
of what they had just seen.

523
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,325
<i>And out of the wreckage</i>
<i>of that concert,</i>

524
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,165
<i>crawled a woman, who would</i>
<i>later give birth to me.</i>

525
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,461
<i>Not once but four times.</i>

526
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,884
<i>'Cause in those days,</i>

<i>the way you looked,</i>

527
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,424
<i>they would send you back in</i>
<i>to bake a little longer.</i>

528
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,968
<i>After four times, they just</i>
<i>decided to cut off my tail.</i>

529
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,013
<i>But you can still see it...</i>
<i>in the British Museum,</i>

00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,478
<i>which, interestingly enough,</i>
<i>is in France.</i>

531
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,138
<i>Not the France</i>
<i>you're thinking of.</i>

532
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,807
<i>But a much better one,</i>
<i>filled with palm trees</i>
<i>and leprechauns.</i>

533
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,977
<i>But I digress.</i>
<i>In fact, I used to be</i>
<i>a professional digressor.</i>

534
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,607
<i>But I don't want</i>
<i>to get off the tracks</i>

535
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,244
<i>so I'll tell you</i>
<i>about the time I was</i>
<i>a professional digressor.</i>

536
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,322
<i>The year was 2021,</i>

537
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,488
<i>and I had just returned</i>
<i>from a brief vacation...</i>

538
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,946
<i>where I'd eaten more</i>
<i>than my fill of tacos.</i>

539
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,827
<i>Not the tacos</i>
<i>you're thinking of.</i>

540
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,884
<i>Did I ever tell you</i>
<i>about the time</i>
<i>I started Gracie Films?</i>

541
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,919
Shh!

542
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,462
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Hey, shh yourself!</i>
