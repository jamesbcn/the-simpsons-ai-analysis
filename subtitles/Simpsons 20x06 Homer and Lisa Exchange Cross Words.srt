1
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:11,711
D'oh!

2
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,631
Lemonade! Sweet sunshine in your mouth!

3
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:37,001
Buy a cup or I punch my sister!
- It's true! He's not bluffing!

4
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:39,806
Ow.

5
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,509
Maybe we should put a dollar in the jar,
prime the pump.

6
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,734
What are we? A piano bar?

7
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,247
I'll take 15 lemonades.
- Make that 16.

8
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,553
Huh?

9
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,257
Lousy dog. If you had your way,
I'd walk you every day.

10
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,425
Lemonade!

11
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,596
GIRL: Stop pushing.

12
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,433
Six cups, please. And put it on my tab.

13
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,501
Keep moving, deadbeat. Cash only.

14
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,605
Fine. Lemonade's for babies, anyways.
I'm going to Moe's for beer!

15
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:16,105
Have fun drinking your lemonade, babies!

16
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:25,069
Lisa? Can Daddy borrow your bike?
- I guess.

17
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,641
Hey, Moe. Give me a...
- Homer, shush.

18
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,044
We're watching Krabappel
try to break up with Skinner.

19
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,781
Seymour, I have something difficult
I want to say to you.

20
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:55,949
I understand.

21
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,686
It can be very difficult for a woman
to propose marriage.

22
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:05,311
But I am willing to go halfsies on a ring.
- Seymour... Excuse me.

23
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,895
Any of you lugs want to break up
with my boyfriend for me?

24
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:09,963
I'll buy you a beer.

25
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,232
Seymour, Edna asked me to talk to you.

26
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,135
Splendid. Shall we discuss music
or the weather?

27
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,069
No. This is about you.
Edna wants to break up.

28
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,637
She wants to break up?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,708
With me?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,876
Look at it this way.
You're a free man, unlike me.

31
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,284
You have all your hair, unlike me.

32
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,054
No kids tying you down
or a crippling mortgage...

33
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:39,626
...that you refinanced at 26% because
a dancing Internet cowboy told you to?

34
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,921
Oh, God, I hate my life.

35
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:48,034
Gee, compared to you,
my life is one big half day.

36
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,738
Exactly. You're good-Iooking.
You have a decent job.

37
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,275
What Ionely widow
wouldn't consider you an option?

38
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,376
Thanks, Homer.

39
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,179
I don't think the school pep squad
could've cheered me up more,

40
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,815
and they were state runners-up in 1997.

41
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,151
Homer, that was amazing.

42
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,121
He actually felt better coming out
of the breakup than he did going in.

43
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,522
Say, Homer, you're real good at this.

44
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,524
Think you could dump
my girlfriend Doreen for me?

45
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,027
Doreen, she's cheated on you
with everyone.

46
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,161
Well, except for me.

47
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,731
And I've showered her with gifts,
fancy soaps and massage oils...

48
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,831
...and what have you.

49
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,297
Here she comes.
Work your magic, Homer.

50
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,407
Is Lenny here?
- I'm afraid Lenny's dead.

51
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,975
What? I just talked to him.

52
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,712
And you will again
because he isn't really dead.

53
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,216
Now this next piece of news
won't seem so bad.

54
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,151
Lemonade! We want lemonade!
- Lemonade! We want lemonade!

55
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:43,691
Don't worry, folks. Our master chef
is stirring up a fresh batch.

56
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,628
Stop that transaction!

57
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,698
I'm a part-time field agent with
the Springfield Department of Commerce!

58
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,067
Great gig.
- It is a great gig.

59
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,136
May I see your vendor's license?

60
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,126
I think it's... We don't have one.

61
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:05,506
35 cents? Where did that come from?
Can't be mine. Must be yours!

62
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,681
I don't care if it's 45
cents, I don't want it.

63
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:13,052
Submit this form to the license bureau.
Until then, this stand is closed!

64
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,152
Boys!

65
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,161
Geez, I'm thirsty. You got any lemonade?
- Not anymore!

66
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,273
Come on, come on! I was halfway through
an operation when my license expired.

67
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,576
I'll get to you just as soon
as I finish this crossword puzzle.

68
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,236
Come on.
- Let's go, buddy!

69
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,472
I left bananas in my car!

70
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,785
Let's see, 10 across,
Franklin Roosevelt's middle name.

71
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,388
Excitement! Wait, that don't fit.

72
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,106
Maybe you could use some help.

73
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,065
FDR's middle name, Delano.
Oxidized surface, well, that's rusty.

74
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,467
Bartenders serve them 'dirty.'
- Ham sandwiches!

75
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,035
No, martinis.
- Oh, right.

76
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,792
One more word. Singer
of Yentl. 13 letters!

77
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,070
I got it! Isaac Bashevis.

78
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,982
Now give me my license!
Give everyone their license!

79
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,186
What is a four letter word for hero?

80
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,811
Hero!
- Yes. But I meant Lisa.

81
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,982
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!
- Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

82
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,330
Y'ello?
- Homer? It's your old roommate, Grady.

83
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,431
The gay guy?

84
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,534
That's not all I am!
Well, it's a lot of what I am.

85
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,670
Anyhoo, I heard how good you are
at breaking up couples.

86
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,706
I need your help to break up with Julio.

87
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:44,544
Because I met someone new,
someone much more cool and refreshing.

88
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,645
Uh-huh.

89
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,779
Got it.

90
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,515
Marge, I'm going to a hardcore gay club...

91
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,851
...and I won't be home
till 3:00 in the morning!

92
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,951
MARGE: Have fun!

93
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,990
Ay, caramba!

94
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,396
Bart, I've fallen in love with crosswords.

95
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,232
It finally happened.
You've gone completely fruit loops.

96
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,868
Froot Loops!
That's the answer to 38 down,

97
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,069
Toucan's delight.

98
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,481
No. I mean you're loco in the coco!

99
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,740
Cocoa! Ice rink drink.

100
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,043
You're losing it!
- Losin'It! Risqué '80s teen flick.

101
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:21,581
Fine! Go nuts! See if I care!
- Eye care. Optician's concern.

102
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:26,185
Thanks for your help, Bart!
BART. San Francisco people mover!

103
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,154
Speaking of San Francisco people mover...

104
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,428
Grady is breaking up with me?

105
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,898
You'll always have a special place
in his heart.

106
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,998
In his what?

107
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,737
Oh!

108
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,006
Oh, baby, you are the breakup king.

109
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,410
You have made the seven minutes
that I'm gonna go without love...

110
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,078
...so much more bearable.

111
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,348
Anyone else want me
to get rid of that special someone?

112
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,933
Okay, everyone. Rotate one to your right.

113
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:09,869
Guess what, Mom? I'm a cruciverbalist!
- Another religion?

114
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,632
You know, you're just gonna drop
the whole thing when you go to college...

115
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,434
...and get a Jewish boyfriend.

116
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:19,472
Probably. But a cruciverbalist
is a fan of crossword puzzles, which I am.

117
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,508
Me, too! I've been doing them since 1958.

118
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,446
Back then, we called
them alphabet hotels...

119
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,286
'cause every letter
gets its own little room.

120
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,854
I still do the Springfield Shopper puzzle
every day.

121
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,289
Let's see there...

122
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,058
Grampa, everyone knows
that the only real test of skill...

123
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,928
...is the New York Times puzzle,
edited by Will Shortz.

124
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:48,233
'Will' and 'Shorts,' two things
I'm no longer allowed to change by myself.

125
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,972
Okay, back to the real world.

126
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,687
Isn't it beautiful?
- Sure is.

127
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,829
Who's driving the bus?
- What bus?

128
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,967
HOMER: Sweet Conclusions Breakup Service.

129
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,303
Oh, yes.
We dispose of your loved one humanely,

130
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,640
thanks to our patented Tenderdump system.

131
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,075
I'll be there in 30 minutes
or your breakup is free!

132
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,041
I'm leaving you, baby

133
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,450
With my clothes in my hand

134
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:46,225
Farewell to you, baby
Get yourself a monkey man

135
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,623
I'm leaving

136
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,797
With my clothes in my hand

137
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,904
Farewell to you

138
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,168
Get yourself a monkey man

139
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,919
Simpson!

140
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,323
What in the blue blazes
are you doing to my hopscotching grids?

141
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,888
I made them into a crossword.

142
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,162
Well, I'm a bit of a puzzle-head myself.

143
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:28,192
They help me wind down
after a day of dealing with Skinner!

144
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,002
You called?
- Made reference.

145
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,437
My mistake.

146
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,507
Lisa, I think you might be ready for this.

147
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,303
'Bald Man's Basketball League'?

148
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,879
Sorry. Wrong flier. I meant this.

149
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,549
'Citywide Crossword Tournament'?
Thank you!

150
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,584
You're welcome.

151
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:49,822
Now I have to go home and make sure
my pool boy is using his skimmer!

152
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,691
You called?
- You misheard.

153
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,791
My mistake.

154
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,454
Marge, if I had $100 for every customer

155
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:00,032
I'd broken up, I'd have
exactly this amount...

156
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,334
'cause that's what I charge!

157
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:06,138
Homie, I'm not sure about
this new business of yours.

158
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,574
You're making it too easy
for couples to break up...

159
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,576
...just because they hit a rough patch.

160
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,278
I know this is hard on you.

161
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,680
But in time, you'll come to see
it's for the best.

162
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,585
That's one of your breakup lines!

163
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,654
What would've happened if there was
someone who could break us up...

164
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,154
...every time I had my doubts about you?

165
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,807
Who are you?

166
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:46,157
We are the spirits of the relationships
you killed.

167
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,341
We're the babies
those couples would have had.

168
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:59,708
And we're the antiques
those couples would have bought together.

169
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,322
Get him, chairs and babies!

170
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,435
Homie?

171
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,237
Marge, I'm getting out
of the breakup business,

172
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,006
and I don't know
if I'll ever sleep soundly again.

173
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,106
Well, maybe...

174
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,655
Wow. So this is what this is.

175
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,625
Cruciverbalists from far and wide
have gathered here...

176
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,361
...for a no-holds-barred test of skill.

177
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,698
Surely some holds are barred?
- No, none.

178
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:43,369
Well, it sounds really exciting
and you're a delightful young lady.

179
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,509
Now if you'll excuse me.

180
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,709
Hey, what's going on?

181
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,484
It's kind of a secret,
so shut the door most of the way.

182
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,551
We found a way
to make this tournament interesting.

183
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,017
We bet on the matches.

184
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,490
Really? Well, I did bring
this envelope full of money.

185
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,558
And these days,

186
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:09,595
betting in a bar is safer than any stock,
bond or real estate investment.

187
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,364
Agreed. So who are you gonna bet on?

188
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,480
I want you to put it
all on my little girl.

189
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,669
And parlay with the Asian kid.

190
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,170
He has a name, you know.

191
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,925
What is it?
- I don't know. He's not my kid.

192
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,877
I win!

193
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:30,116
She won! And like any prudent gambler,
I know when to walk away... Never!

194
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,743
Dah pretty ladies around the world

195
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,890
Got a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls

196
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,761
Tell your brother, your sister
And your mama, too...

197
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,198
'Cause they're about to go down
And you'll know just what to do

198
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:50,598
Wave your hands in the air
Like you don't care

199
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:54,473
Glide by the people
As they start to look and stare

200
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:58,568
Do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance quick

201
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:02,511
Mama, come on baby
Tell me what's the word

202
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,776
Word up

203
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,375
Everybody say

204
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,923
When you hear the call
You've got to get it underway

205
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,023
Word up

206
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,775
Okay, everybody. Take a break.

207
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,330
Dad, I could actually win this thing.

208
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,024
And when you win, I win.

209
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,904
I'll explain that to you on your deathbed.

210
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:29,542
My only fear is, I always sabotage myself
when I'm on the verge of happiness.

211
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,110
You what?
- In my young life,

212
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,747
I've seen that every time
I'm about to achieve true happiness,

213
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,917
some little piece of me says,
'You don't deserve this.'

214
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,586
And another little piece says, 'I agree.'

215
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,222
Right, right! But will
it happen this time?

216
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,026
With my luck, I bet it will.
It's practically a sure thing.

217
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,761
Hmm.

218
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,797
Contestants to your boards.

219
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,617
Wish me luck!
- Just be yourself!

220
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:59,038
I want to change my bet.
I'm going against my daughter!

221
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,176
I'll take your money,
but I won't look you in the eye.

222
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,166
Fine. I won't look you in the eye.

223
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,319
Have I made the bet yet?
- I got it.

224
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,788
We're down to our final two contestants.

225
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,224
But before they compete,
we would like to pay tribute...

226
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:22,061
...to all the words that have been removed
from the dictionary in the past year.

227
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,000
You know, my wife, Shirley,

228
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,551
she's the real crossword
ace in our family.

229
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,053
Fills in those letters
fast as hail on a tin roof.

230
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,451
Ping-ping-ping, she's done.

231
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,260
Shirley passed away two years ago.
But I'm still not over it.

232
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,896
That's so sad.
- Hey, what can you do?

233
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:02,001
Life keeps changing the music, but
you gotta keep up the cha-cha-cha, huh?

234
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:13,049
Let's see. I'll spread some Q's around.
That'll get my brain going.

235
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:19,337
I dropped my glasses!
Oh, Shirley baby, I let you down.

236
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,926
Hey, there are no lenses in these glasses.

237
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,695
Let's see. That's Enrico Fermi.
And there you got the Pet Shop Boys.

238
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,030
And cross the 'T' and zing the 'z.'

239
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,632
And skit-skat-skoodly,
I'm all the way home.

240
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,869
Lisa got hustled.

241
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,408
I blew it again.

242
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,509
She blew it again!

243
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,577
Woo-hoo!

244
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,746
Here's your money,
drenched in your daughter's tears.

245
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:52,861
You know, for a bartender bookie,
you're awfully judgmental.

246
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,225
Boy, Dad seems awfully happy.

247
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,810
And there's something different
about him.

248
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,721
He bought new shoelaces
with fancy metal tips.

249
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,839
Dad, did you come into some money
we don't know about?

250
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,319
No.
- You got highlights in your hair!

251
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,246
The sun did that.

252
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,717
And your car antenna
has been straightened and re-balled.

253
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,817
What's going on?

254
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,689
Well, sweetie,
Daddy made a little extra money...

255
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,992
...betting against you
in the crossword tournament.

256
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,593
You'll understand when you're a parent...

257
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,396
...placing large wagers
against your own children.

258
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,496
I hope you're not mad.

259
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,727
No, I'm not mad.

260
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,507
You sure you're not mad?
- No, I'm not mad.

261
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,912
You sure you're not mad?
- No, I'm not mad.

262
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,423
Mr. Teddy, can you ask Lisa if she's mad?

263
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,826
What's that, Mr. Teddy?
You're saying that you know women.

264
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:12,031
And that when women say
they're not mad, they're madder than ever?

265
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:16,636
She's gone. Can you drive me home?
I'm a little drunk.

266
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,171
Lisa? Lisa?

267
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,444
Lisa, sweetie, please look at your daddy.

268
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,914
You stopped being my daddy
as soon as you bet against me!

269
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:33,252
All I have now is a mom.
Which is why I'm taking her maiden name.

270
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,412
From now on, I'm Lisa Bouvier!

271
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,359
Hey, Mr. S, Lisa B.

272
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,619
No!

273
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,899
Would you like to buy some band candy?
- Yes!

274
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,671
Lisa's mad at me,

275
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,542
and now she's using
Marge's maiden name instead of mine.

276
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,477
Homer, whatever you done
to that little girl,

277
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,913
you just gotta do something even nicer
to win her back.

278
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,481
She may never take back your name,

279
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,717
but there's still a chance
she'll take you back as her daddy.

280
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:10,172
Wow. Nobody gives better
parenting advice than childless drunks.

281
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,759
So the name Lisa Simpson
is available, huh?

282
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,662
A lot of goodwill attached to that name.
I'm gonna take it.

283
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,328
Lisa's Tavern. Lisa speaking.

284
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,042
Lisa, sweetie,
I'm honored that you chose my name,

285
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,410
but it's not that great.

286
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,080
Back in high school,
the boys used to call me Marge Boobier.

287
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,916
Hey, Bouvier was Jackie Kennedy's
maiden name.

288
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,226
Really? I never knew that.

289
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,755
Well, what did you think her name was
before it was Kennedy?

290
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,323
Jackie O! Like SpaghettiOs!

291
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,793
I thought that was where
her money came from.

292
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:52,331
Look, why don't you cheer up by doing
a New York Times crossword puzzle, huh?

293
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,699
I'm through with crosswords.

294
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,169
My innocence died
in those 441 little boxes.

295
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,205
It might be a fun way
to kill a couple hours.

296
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,774
A couple hours?

297
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,954
I can do the Sunday puzzle
in less than one hour.

298
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,278
'Couple of hours.'

299
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,578
Last clue, loses on purpose.

300
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,651
Huh...

301
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:14,987
Diet!

302
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,123
Will Shortz, you clever rascal.

303
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,616
And a new record time! Wait a second.

304
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,561
'Dumb dad sorry for his bet.'

305
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,101
Wow. It's almost as if
Dad planted that message.

306
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,601
No. It must just be a weird coincidence.

307
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:37,200
But what if it's not? It must be.
Or mustn't it not?

308
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,022
Dad, I know this is crazy,

309
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,392
but did you plant a message to me
in the New York Times crossword puzzle?

310
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,961
Well, I had a little help from this guy.

311
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,902
New York Times crossword editor,
Will Shortz!

312
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,902
And master puzzle constructor,
Merl Reagle!

313
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,106
I actually wrote that crossword.
- And I edited it.

314
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,606
Now get back to crosswording!
- Yes, sir.

315
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:16,984
Well, I must admit, I'm kind of touched.
'Dumb dad sorry for his bet.' Nice.

316
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,551
You didn't get Homer's
whole message, Lisa.

317
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,619
I didn't?

318
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,884
Take a look at the first letters
of all the clues.

319
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:31,692
Dear Lisa, you make me so happy.

320
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,766
Really, really, really happy.

321
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:39,838
Sorry. He told me I needed 144 letters.
What was my point again?

322
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:44,966
Oh, right.
Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you.

323
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,613
Oh, Dad.

324
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,680
...

325
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,717
...Cherish is the word I use to describe

326
00:20:56,154 --> 00:21:02,024
All the feeling that I have
hiding here for you inside

327
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:09,696
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I had told you

328
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,582
English - US - SDH
