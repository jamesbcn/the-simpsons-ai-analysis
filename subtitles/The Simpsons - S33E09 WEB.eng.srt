1
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,945
Boring.
Boring.

2
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,747
Boring. Boring. Boring.

3
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:14,948
Seen it.

4
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,517
Lived it.

5
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,320
Looks like you've
discovered Muttflix, Bart.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,923
The premium cable channel
made for dogs.

7
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,632
They show short scenes from
a canine point of view.

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,467
It's to a dog's eyes

9
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:37,371
what opening a can of
dog food is to their ears.

10
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,739
Squirrel.

11
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,054
And they say there's no good
TV show ideas anymore.

12
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,958
Your dog bit me.

13
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,493
Made my day.

14
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,338
Ah, what's she doing here?

15
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,340
Santa's Little Helper
wanted to invite

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,642
his mom over since
it's Mother's Day.

17
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,644
Mother's Day...

18
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,714
So sweet.

19
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,084
Did you say it's Mother's Day?

20
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,323
Oh, Mom.
We haven't forgotten you.

21
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:33,627
Guess what I've got.
A mug I made at school!

22
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,796
Oh. Great. Thanks.

23
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,571
And, Mom, although I believe
Mother's Day is a B. S. holiday...

24
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,007
Unlike true holidays,
like my half birthday

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,842
or May the Fourth Be With You...

26
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,644
I, too, made you a mug.

27
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,580
Thank you for trying.

28
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,088
Nothing in this world
beats a baby's kiss.

29
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,893
Thinks she's so cute.

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,797
How do you tell someone
who doesn't talk to shut up?

31
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,600
Kids, I love all
your presents and...

32
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,768
Homer?

33
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,538
This is the one holiday

34
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,072
that means something to me.

35
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,875
Well, I was gonna make you
breakfast in bed,

36
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,278
but you know the food
always comes out bad...

37
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,846
Ugh, so bad.

38
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,015
And we always leave
a mess in the kitchen,

39
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,018
which is worse than making
no breakfast at all.

40
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,786
Basically we're idiots.

41
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,155
Hmm. Where is this going?

42
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:39,826
So I thought, why not get you
a nice picture frame instead?

43
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,361
It'll last longer
than a breakfast

44
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,064
and I carefully chose a picture
of all the kids...

45
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,832
and... pour vous.

46
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,435
Aw, that is nice.

47
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,139
What is it, Dad?
What's wrong?

48
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,708
It's... it's just...

49
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,444
Homer, it's your mother.

50
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,113
This image is all
you've got left of me.

51
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:04,017
And it's starting to get
a little fuzzier each year.

52
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,253
Mom.

53
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,389
If only I could kiss
your fuzzy face.

54
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:13,760
Same cold nose,
but not the same.

55
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,462
I miss you, Mom.

56
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,533
Oh, my God! Dad's reliving
the great tragedy of his life.

57
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,734
And that is?

58
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,902
Losing your mother.

59
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,971
Oh, my God.

60
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,808
I'm so sorry, Homer.

61
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,877
Nothing can replace your mom.

62
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,945
But you do have your father.

63
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,982
Let it out, Dad.

64
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,650
Studies show losing a parent

65
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,320
is the most traumatic thing
that can happen to a child.

66
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,592
What a sad thing to say.

67
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,572
When Homer croaks we're gonna
have to spring for

68
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,063
an XXL elephant coffin.

69
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,267
Not funny, Bart.

70
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:55,736
Hey, the cat liked it.

71
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,706
Dad, maybe you should
get some therapy.

72
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,676
I just don't know if we can

73
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,478
afford more mental health.

74
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,780
Don't worry, Mom.
Thanks to the app store,

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,649
there's a solution
to everything.

76
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,751
Nutz, the therapy app.

77
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:11,885
Woo-hoo!

78
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,921
I can confront
my grief on the john!

79
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,522
Welcome to Nutz,

80
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,558
the app that can
process your loss,

81
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,661
talk you down from highs,
pick you up from lows,

82
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,162
maintain your mediums,

83
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,097
and find CBD gummies

84
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,500
in the shape of
your version of God.

85
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,369
Fix my brain.

86
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,838
"Nature of grief?"

87
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,439
"Loss of mother."

88
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,841
"Age of loss?"

89
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,609
"Nine years old."

90
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,077
"Are you a robot?"

91
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,012
I wish.

92
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,087
Okay, people.
Let's earn those PhDs.

93
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,555
Who wants "lost his mother"?

94
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,157
Lost his mother?

95
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,226
Oh, come on,
that's a premium disorder.

96
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,061
You can't make him worse.

97
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,062
I'll take it.

98
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,197
Okay, we've also got a jumper,
a bed-wetter,

99
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,199
and a guy
who's still messed up

100
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,101
because the Patriots traded Brady.

101
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,103
And remember,
if you get 'em to cry,

102
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,606
you get a turn
in the cash tornado.

103
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,044
Hello, Homer.

104
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,646
Please enter date of loss.

105
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,753
I wrote this on the liquor
cabinet so you would see it.

106
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,557
I am wanted by the FBI

107
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,926
and leaving forever.

108
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,797
Abe! Put down the booze
and take care of Homer.

109
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:34,101
Go to him.
Be gentle and sensitive.

110
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,470
Strong and... Absolut Vodka.

111
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,072
Now you're just
reading the label.

112
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,607
When's Mommy coming back?

113
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,075
- She's not.
- Why not?

114
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,644
Uh... she's dead.

115
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,612
That oughta hold him.

116
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,916
That must have been rough.

117
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,484
But I know something
that could help.

118
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:51,552
Simply...

119
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,086
Press button to pay

120
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,156
another 99 cents.

121
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,758
Think back...

122
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,426
back to when
you first realized

123
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,962
you didn't really know
what happened to your mother.

124
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,764
I was 16.

125
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,600
I had just learned to drive.

126
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,640
Same time tomorrow.

127
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,741
Well, well, well.

128
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,643
First-time driver, eh?

129
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,212
Well, this is my first case.

130
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,013
And I'm doin' this by the book.

131
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,416
Which, uh, I left
back at the station.

132
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,252
So, uh... Yeah.
I better go get it.

133
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,121
Donuts? What are those?

134
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,990
I better investigate.

135
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:38,599
She's alive!
She's alive.

136
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,100
Who's alive?

137
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,338
No one!
And I'm going to find her.

138
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,877
Letting that postcard
go through

139
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,045
was the smartest thing
we ever did.

140
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,749
Yeah. That kid's gonna lead us
right to Mona Simpson.

141
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:56,984
My mom's alive.

142
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,786
I'm so mad at her and my dad.

143
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,256
This is the greatest day
of my life!

144
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:08,428
Oh, why did I get
a lifetime subscription?

145
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,768
Hey, how do ya sell these,
anyway?

146
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,538
- By the dozen.
- Hoo boy. Mmm.

147
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,997
Now that you know
your mother had left you,

148
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,287
how did you deal with the fact

149
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,289
that it was all your fault?

150
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,125
Wait. What?
Th-That can't be right.

151
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,626
Congratulations.

152
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,163
You have been upgraded
to a much better therapist.

153
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,799
Pay $2.99 to accept.

154
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,336
Hoo boy.

155
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,405
Mr. Simpson,
when you found out

156
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,876
your mother was alive,
were you conflicted?

157
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,048
I decided it was time
my father and I had a talk

158
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,650
about what really happened
to my mother.

159
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,554
- You told me Mom was dead!
- She is.

160
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,889
Why wasn't there a funeral?

161
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,157
There was too much going on.

162
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,758
My wife just died,
for God's sake.

163
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,928
Dad, there's something you're
not telling me about Mom.

164
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,164
Well, son,
when a man and a woman

165
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,498
love each other very much,

166
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,968
they want to make a baby
that is immediately

167
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,803
a source of huge conflict.

168
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,304
Not that. Where is she?

169
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,673
Well, the truth is,
I don't exactly know

170
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:27,908
what happened
to your mother.

171
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,143
She's alive
and wanted by the FBI

172
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,446
for some radical
hippie nonsense.

173
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,916
When she said "outta sight,"
she wasn't kidding around.

174
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,018
- Why did you lie?
- To protect you.

175
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,586
Protect me from what?

176
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:40,954
To protect you from a woman

177
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,156
who didn't love me enough!

178
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,392
Oh, my God,
I wasn't protecting you,

179
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,492
I was protecting me.

180
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,495
From the shame
of a wife who left.

181
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,665
Because I never gave her
what she wanted most,

182
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,333
which was to leave me.

183
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,170
And as TV shows have
shown us again and again,

184
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,372
that moment
of self-realization is

185
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,775
all it takes
to cure my alcoholism.

186
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,112
Yippee!
God bless ya, son!

187
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:08,015
You and I have each other
and that's all we'll ever need.

188
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,822
This isn't over.

189
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,024
What did you just think?

190
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,525
You heard me!

191
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,060
That must have been difficult.

192
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:21,895
How did you deal
with your grief?

193
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,430
I tried everything.

194
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,465
I went to
the guidance counselor.

195
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:26,967
I'm torn up inside.

196
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,211
Have you considered the Army?

197
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,338
They're always looking for
angry, messed-up young men.

198
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,606
No, thank you!

199
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,007
I went to the church.

200
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,075
It didn't help.

201
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,243
I lost my mother

202
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,178
and I can't get rid of the pain.

203
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:41,048
Have you considered
another religion? Hmm?

204
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,951
Then one night,
I came to a decision.

205
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,853
Why did she go to Utah?

206
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:49,790
Every kid there already has
more moms than they need.

207
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,925
I never even got
to give this to her.

208
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,561
Who knows where she ranks now?

209
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,164
I'm gonna find my mother.

210
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,733
So one day I set out on my own.

211
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,821
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

212
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,647
Old Man Simpson!

213
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,182
I'm here to stop you, son.

214
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,384
You remember your mom
as a perfect woman.

215
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,821
But... I hate to say this...
she wasn't perfect.

216
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,823
She hogged the blankets
something awful.

217
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,658
She had a hard-to-remember
birthday.

218
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:28,729
Please, Dad. I need to know
what happened to her.

219
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,298
Oh, I can't say no
to that face.

220
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,635
I think everything's gonna
be better from now on.

221
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,971
Just drive!

222
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:44,611
As my father
and I drove fatefully

223
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:47,314
through the badlands of Utah,
our relationship

224
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:50,050
grew deeper and closer
than ever before.

225
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,452
Say, boy,
are you left-handed or right?

226
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,821
- Right.
- I never knew that.

227
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,557
Do you like books or TV?

228
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,325
- TV.
- Me, too!

229
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:01,361
You've answered all
my questions. Let's eat.

230
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,000
Can I help you boys?

231
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:08,969
I'm lookin' for my ex-wife.

232
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,471
Aw. Well, when was
the last time you saw her?

233
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,773
Seven years ago.

234
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,575
Trust me, it's over.

235
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,443
Just tell me if you've seen her!

236
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:20,047
I seen a runaway rose
like her workin' a gas 'n' go

237
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,516
near the slot canyons.
Who wants to know?

238
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,018
Let's just say a man
who's had his heart broken

239
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,421
and a boy whose
closest thing to a mother

240
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,324
was the lady on the bottle
of maple syrup.

241
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,160
I see.

242
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,162
You look lonely, cowboy.

243
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:37,297
Well,
only if you consider "lonely"

244
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,566
being without companionship
of any kind

245
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,001
for 2,600 days.

246
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,403
Well, some of us get
pretty lonesome, too,

247
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:45,539
when the night comes
and your double wide

248
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:47,641
seems double empty.

249
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,708
Hint, hint.

250
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,143
Oh, I hear ya.

251
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,612
But I got the boy with me.

252
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:54,047
So we'll skip the first date
that starts awkward

253
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,182
but ends with potential,

254
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,950
the second date
where we hit it off,

255
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,485
the third date
where you find out

256
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,455
beneath my crusty exterior
is some sweet apple pie,

257
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:03,490
and skip right to the part
where we break up

258
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,459
because I gotta take
my son to his mother.

259
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:08,695
Aw. We had some good times,
didn't we?

260
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:12,232
Yeah, we sure did.

261
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,744
Mm. Oh, Mona.

262
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,088
Hey, I thought
you stopped drinking.

263
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,247
I stopped drinking at night.

264
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:32,119
Oh, here comes the remorse.

265
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,333
9,094...

266
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,734
9,095...

267
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:50,737
9,096 stars in the sky.

268
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,940
I think you missed that one.

269
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,542
One, two, three...

270
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,144
Ah, so peaceful.

271
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:59,279
It reminds me of
another night when the sky

272
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,815
looked just like this...

273
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,051
I'm gonna tell you
a war story, son.

274
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,986
A story of patriotism,
sacrifice,

275
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:08,856
and sexy ladies drawn on planes.

276
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,759
I was trapped in a foxhole
with my best friend Charlie...

277
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,661
Abe, I got a funny feeling...

278
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,063
I ain't gonna make it.

279
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,332
That's crazy talk!
Uh...

280
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,068
did you always
not have a bottom half?

281
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,437
I just got one request.

282
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:27,541
Tied to my dog tags is
a picture of my gal, Clara.

283
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:28,408
Take 'em to her.

284
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,811
Tell her I used up
my last breath

285
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,480
sayin' her name.
Clara.

286
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,420
Let that be a lesson
to you, boy.

287
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,989
Don't procrastinate.

288
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,891
So it's good
we're lookin' for your ma.

289
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,860
And I'm passin'
these dog tags along to you.

290
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,601
It's your job now, son.

291
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,037
Boy, somewhere there's
a hundred-year-old woman

292
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,238
waiting for ya.

293
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,440
We Simpson men
won't let her down!

294
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,943
Uh, I'm sorry, I digress.

295
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,912
Never be afraid to digress.

296
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,247
Some of the best insights
come that way.

297
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,116
Oh, is it digression you want?

298
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:12,252
Well, you know, shoes didn't
always have tongues...

299
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,654
- Not from you.
- Oh...

300
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:17,925
Homer, so you were
closing in on your mother.

301
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,494
Did that bring up any fears?
Did it?

302
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,296
- Did it?
- Yes.

303
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,264
Would she still love me
as much as she did

304
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,799
when she left me forever?

305
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,734
I mean, it's a pretty low bar.

306
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:38,078
How old is your boy?

307
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,214
- 16.
- Oh, I thought so.

308
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:43,650
I always cry at any boy
between 12 and 20.

309
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,620
I have a son that age.
Haven't seen him in years.

310
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:49,590
It's heartbreaking.
I don't know if I'll ever...

311
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,325
Oh, there he is.

312
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,928
Can that really be
my little Homer?

313
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,165
It's him!

314
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,433
Mom?

315
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,969
Homer!
I miss you so much!

316
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,037
Such a beautiful voice.

317
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,873
Wait right there.

318
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,641
Here I come. I love you.

319
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:14,781
FBI!

320
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,650
How did she spot us?

321
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,254
Mom...?

322
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,601
If I find her,

323
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,069
we'll be a family again.

324
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,638
With the yelling,
and the resentment,

325
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,006
and the slamming doors.

326
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,474
It'll be wonderful.

327
00:15:40,574 --> 00:15:43,610
- D'oh! Son!
- I can't get through!

328
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,214
Oh, forget me.
Just go ahead.

329
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:52,252
Hurry. If you don't go soon,
you'll lose her forever.

330
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,027
No!
You didn't leave me, Dad.

331
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,228
I can't leave you.

332
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:05,299
You came back... for me?

333
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,500
Yes.

334
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:07,901
I love you, Dad.

335
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:09,369
I love you too, boy.

336
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,972
But that was a dumb choice
you just made.

337
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,041
FBI. Official business.

338
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:17,177
Sir, put your son down
and kick him in front of you.

339
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,745
Never!
What the...

340
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,014
Watch it!
That part ain't for grabbin'!

341
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,016
I thought you guys were
untouchable... get off me!

342
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,484
Help! Police!

343
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,859
Where you goin', lady?

344
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,093
Anywhere you are.

345
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,097
To San Francisco!
Till it gentrifies.

346
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,003
You ever think of all the
violent criminals going free

347
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,806
while we were chasing
after this one woman?

348
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:48,308
That's why I don't
read the papers.

349
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,510
Smart.

350
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:52,546
We never found Mona. Oh...

351
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:55,082
You know, I just realized
I could have found her,

352
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,085
waited, then gone back for you
and I would have had everything.

353
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,786
Woulda coulda shouda, loser.

354
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,054
Misbehaving child?

355
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,490
Check out our list
of pacifying drugs.

356
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,303
Oh, boy, that's really sad.

357
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,205
That's it, boy.

358
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,308
Deal with feelings
like I taught you.

359
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,410
That must have
been so confusing.

360
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,480
You actually found your mom,
then lost her again.

361
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,583
- That's right.
- Misery piled on misery.

362
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,186
A seven-layer dip of woe.

363
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:35,055
And that's how
I met your mother.

364
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:38,559
Who turned everything around.

365
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,993
That is fantastic.

366
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,129
And since you know
that she'll always be there,

367
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,164
you don't have to be afraid
of abandonment.

368
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,934
You're right.
What a great therapist.

369
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,169
Delete app.
-Wait, what?

370
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,638
I warned you about
solving people's problems.

371
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:55,075
He was so simple I-I just
couldn't stretch it out.

372
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:58,345
You're fired.
Put that coffee down.

373
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,814
You have major hostility
and control issues.

374
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,015
Bye-bye!

375
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,017
But there's a little more
to the story.

376
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,320
Something I've never told anyone.

377
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,889
It happened when
Bart was born...

378
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,625
Homer, would you like
to cut the cord?

379
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,060
My pleasure.

380
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,197
What the... It's so tough
you can't cut it.

381
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:22,102
Why is this like...
Why, you little...

382
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,905
Such a beautiful moment.

383
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,007
More morphine, sweetie?

384
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,076
Oh, no, thank you.

385
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,477
You sure? It's free.

386
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:33,747
Mm... Maybe just a little
for mama.

387
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,684
What the... Hey.

388
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,852
He's mooning me.

389
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,754
Newborns don't moon people.

390
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:47,661
Everything I need
is in this room.

391
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,168
I'm the...
pediatrician.

392
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,570
Just want to take
a look at your boy.

393
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:57,905
So beautiful.

394
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,040
Really? Don't you see
a lot of these?

395
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:02,643
Not one that's my grandson.

396
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,112
Mom?

397
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,315
When I heard about the baby,

398
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,484
I just had to come and see him.

399
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,685
But I can't stay.

400
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:16,256
Just know
I'm always with you in here.

401
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,893
I guess that'll have to do.

402
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:23,997
I even miss you sometimes.

403
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,633
Wait! Doctor! Let's talk!

404
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:27,801
Was it a dream?

405
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:31,038
There's no way I'll ever know.

406
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,273
It wasn't a dream.
I was there.

407
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:37,744
There's no reliable way
I'll ever know.

408
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:40,280
Either way, Dad, it's wonderful.

409
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,616
You have found closure.

410
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,284
Closure. Disclaimer:

411
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:48,455
Closure is no longer considered
a valid psychological construct.

412
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,723
Closure!

413
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,060
This is the best
Mother's Day ever.

414
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:02,436
Or it will be the best
Mother's Day ever.

415
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:05,372
Once I take your mother to
the finest restaurant in town.

416
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:08,108
Where I actually
made reservations.

417
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:11,512
This is the best
Mother's Day ever!

418
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,116
Everything I need
is in this room.

419
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:20,387
Sir, this is not a buffet.
Please stay out of the kitchen.

420
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:23,624
When a sign says "brunch,"
I brunch.

421
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,908
Honey, can we

422
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,218
have dinner
on the floor tonight?

423
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,377
No.

Mom?
