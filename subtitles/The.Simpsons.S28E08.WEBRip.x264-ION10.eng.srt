00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,297
Ju-- This isn't fun at all.

176
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,514
-I'm done.
-Fine.

177
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,223
You know the monkeys
also rate the customers.

178
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,563
Now everyone will know
what kind of man you are.

179
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,141
Good-bye, Tyler.

180
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,596
Jerk.

181
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,476
"Jerk." Bart used to call me that.

182
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,114
(sobs)

183
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,781
Be careful, Dad.

184
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,243
Being careful is not going to get us on

185
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,123
<i>America's Funniest Home Videos.</i>

186
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Now, when I nod,
you pull the bottom brick out

187
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,997
and the wall falls on me.

188
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Then call Vin Di Bona Productions,

189
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,376
then an ambulance.

190
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,919
Wait.
Won't they know this video is fake?

191
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,343
Why would I be filming you making a wall?

192
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,262
Why didn't you bring these things up

193
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,590
at the production meeting?

194
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,005
Well, it's too late now!

195
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,763
Oh, great!

196
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,845
Dad, can I get you
one of my children's Xanax?

197
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,231
What I need is that $10,000 prize.

198
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,350
Not $5,000.
I already spent that on bricks.

199
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,688
Now pull that rope.

200
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,232
If I pull the rope and it kills you,

201
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,067
I'll need a lot of therapy.

202
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,282
I'm not gonna die, son.

203
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,072
Uh, but if I do, can you play
"Nobody Does It Better"

204
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,077
at my funeral on the recorder?

205
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,909
I can't be a part of this.

206
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,464
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

207
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,208
{\an8}-Luann, help!
-I'm in a hurry.

208
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,129
{\an8}Well, at least I got it on video.

209
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,172
{\an8}Delete.

210
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,594
{\an8}(groans) Ah, come on.

211
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,473
{\an8}NELSON: Haw-haw!

212
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,800
(knocking on door)

213
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,352
Dad, it's me.

214
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,941
What are you doing here?
It's not pudding day.

215
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,268
(sighs) My son doesn't want
to be with me anymore.

216
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,355
So you realize that's how you've
treated me all these years

217
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,531
and you've come to apologize.

218
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,360
Look, Dad, I would visit more

219
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,815
if I hadn't put you in
such a depressing place.

220
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,736
Whatever.
I've got a real problem here.

221
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,735
I'm gonna be a father again!

222
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,697
My girlfriend's pregnant.

223
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,708
(gasps) That's insane!

224
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,630
I leave you alone for six months
and this is what happens?

225
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,209
How did you even meet her?

226
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,674
Oh, this home just got the Internet

227
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,045
and everyone's using senior dating sites.

228
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,472
Gray Date,
Friends with Social Security Benefits.

229
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,683
Everyone's making whoopee
and hanky-panky.

230
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,064
A few are even having sex.

231
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,100
(whines)

232
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,443
You can't leave me.

233
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,899
We started a puzzle together.

234
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,820
My heart's bleeding.

235
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,738
Seriously. Please call 9-1-1.

236
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,700
Abraham Simpson.
Are you skipping town on me?

237
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,164
No, no. I like you.

238
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,075
It's the baby I'm skipping town on.

239
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,673
You don't want our baby?

240
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,128
Before you judge me,
look where my DNA leads.

241
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,260
I'm fine. (grunts)

242
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,458
Hmm.

243
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,048
I think he's sweet.

244
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,973
Would he like to play with my keys?

245
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,971
I am a normal person, and yes.

246
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,724
All right, I'll man up.

247
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,766
But remember, men of my generation

248
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,230
don't change a diaper, attend a birth,

249
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,231
or talk to the child before he's drafted.

250
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,484
I couldn't ask for more.

251
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,816
(rattling)

252
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,322
I thought you just rolled.

253
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,074
-Those were my knees.
-(rattling)

254
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,406
Rent six dollars?!

255
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,990
You can't even buy
a Monopoly set for that.

256
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,196
(chuckles)
Great commentary, Bart.

257
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,457
-Love you, man.
-I love you.

258
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,384
-Hi, I'm Matt.
-Milhouse.

259
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,959
I'm Bart's best friend.

260
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,884
Aw, sounds like someone
wants an autograph.

261
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,553
I do. Who are you?

262
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,013
I misspelled my name.
But that makes it worth more.

263
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,053
Come on, Leinart,
get your head in the game.

264
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,887
Bart, I got a straight up swap.

265
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,312
How 'bout I give you
Boardwalk and Park Place,

266
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,731
and you give me Ventnor?

267
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,099
-That's crazy talk.
-Oh, yeah?

268
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,227
What "History of Board Games"
class did you take

269
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,774
when you were in college?

270
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,687
My friend, you have a deal.

271
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,912
You got Chance.

272
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,568
"Take a walk on the Boardwalk,"

273
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,277
which I now own,
and you're bankrupt, and I win.

274
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,368
Wow, you beat me at every game,

275
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,583
even Heisman Trophy Trivial Pursuit.

276
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,754
Oh! Can I play Bart next?

277
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,132
{\an8}I carry my own little top hat with me.

278
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,130
{\an8}Oh.

279
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,421
{\an8}Is this guy bothering you, Bart?

280
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,094
{\an8}I'll make sure he finds the door.

281
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,302
(gasps) Could you throw me out
in a perfect spiral?

282
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,764
I can walk you out in a straight line.

283
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,064
Wow!
No one's gonna believe that at school.

284
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,059
(cackles)

285
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,561
Huh?

286
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,364
{\an8}<i>(Bart thinking) "Always let him win"?</i>

287
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,228
{\an8}<i>"Don't let him see this sheet"?</i>

288
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,475
{\an8}<i>He called me the greatest</i>
<i>receiver he'd ever thrown to.</i>

289
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,487
{\an8}<i>Was that a lie, too?</i>

290
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,409
LEINART: Get out there.

291
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,118
Hey, Mr. Simpson.

292
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,698
Hey, Milk Dud.

293
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,453
Uh, listen, I got to go change
the oil in my car.

294
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,286
Don't you want to get a Choremonkey?

295
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,581
They cut me off.

296
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,794
I never dreamed when I gave 'em
my credit card number

297
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,714
that they would charge me.

298
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,293
You could help me out if you want.

299
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,878
I have an old shirt you could wear.

300
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,723
An old shirt! Wow!

301
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,378
My dad doesn't have any of those.

302
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,814
Wow. Anyone ever tell you that
you're excellent at gluing?

303
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,969
Um, no.

304
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,187
And your rubber cement boogers
were very convincing.

305
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,149
Look, I know you're doing this
because you have to.

306
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,729
How would you like it if the other team

307
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,114
had just let you win all the time?

308
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,730
That would have been really great.

309
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,737
(cell phone buzzes)

310
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,568
Listen, I have another Choremonkey job.

311
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,613
I'll see you around.

312
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,116

313
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,778
Huh? Huh. Hmm.

314
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:27,458
Wait, I don't think a bouncer
throws people <i>into </i>a bar.

315
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,418
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You just bounce, all right?

316
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,618
I'll tell you which way.

317
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,378
LEINART:
Get in there. (sputters) Ralph.

318
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,671
Yay! I'm a touchdown.

319
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,505

320
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,090
{\an8}Boop! (laughs)

321
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,545
{\an8}Look who's a greasy guy! (laughs)

322
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,505
{\an8}Now you're greasy, too! (laughs)

323
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,927
{\an8}-Look at you.
-(laughs)

324
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,556
{\an8}Bloop, bloop.

325
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,312
{\an8}Well, hello, Tony Stark.

326
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,685
{\an8}We've never had fun like that
in my whole life.

327
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,863
{\an8}Oh, look!
The engine block pizza is almost done.

328
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,282

329
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,990

330
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,660
Car food is our thing.

331
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,029

332
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,575
Oh. He never warns me.
