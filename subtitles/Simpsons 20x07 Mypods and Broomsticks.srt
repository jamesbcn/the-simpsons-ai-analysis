1
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,249
D'oh!

2
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,005
SANTAS: Ho-ho-ho.

3
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,011
ALL: O Christmas Tree, O Christmas Tree...

4
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,880
You're on the curb and dead now
- You're on the curb and dead now...

5
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,883
Your Christmas lights are in the box
- Your Christmas lights are in the box

6
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,120
In two months we will change the clocks

7
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,220
O Christmas Tree, O...

8
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,828
They sure give the Christmas spirit
the bum's rush around here.

9
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:39,603
And they've already started exploiting
the next holiday.

10
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,451
So, young man, have you judged people...

11
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:45,105
...by the content of
their character this year?

12
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,440
Yes, Reverend Doctor.
- Lunch time!

13
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,940
Free at last! Free at last!

14
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,212
Okay, remember our deal.

15
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,316
Everyone gets to return one
Christmas present with no hurt feelings.

16
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,985
I'm returning this kitten calendar.

17
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,388
I'm also returning this kitten calendar.

18
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,488
Kitten calendar.

19
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:09,788
Hey, those are 15 month calendars!
That gives you three extra kittens!

20
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:14,000
That's the last time I get you guys
a Christmas present at the last minute.

21
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,702
Man, those are ugly kittens.

22
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,032
Mom! Dad! Our mall got a Mapple Store!

23
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,408
It's so sterile.

24
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,508
MyPods. MyPhones.

25
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,943
A Brainiac Bar.

26
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,048
My question is the following statement.

27
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:32,886
Operating system 4.2 has sloppier
architecture than a Tijuana anthill.

28
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,922
Did you get peanut butter
in your Ethernet port again?

29
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,167
No. I got mayonnaise in the CD drive.

30
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,329
I see you're admiring our MyCube.

31
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,965
It's fueled by dreams
and powered by imagination.

32
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,734
What does it do?
- You should ask yourself,

33
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,304
'What can I do for it?'
- Okay, what can I do for you?

34
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,374
Please, I'm begging you!
- Sir, it's not even turned on yet.

35
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:58,979
But it's glowing.
- That light confirms that it's off.

36
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,081
I can't afford any of your products.

37
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,485
But can I buy some fake white earbuds
so people will think I have a MyPod?

38
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,390
Sure. Those are called MyPhonies.

39
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,088
And they cost $40.

40
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,094
I'll never get a Mapple anything.

41
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,404
KRUSTY: I hate this MyPod!

42
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,798
I can't watch movies
on a screen this small!

43
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:22,468
And the music today, don't get me started!

44
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,338
I said don't get me started!

45
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,265
Come on!
Isn't someone gonna get me started?

46
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,483
Let's go, Teeny.

47
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,786
Maybe somebody at Old Navy
will get me started.

48
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,622
Here, kid. You take it.
- Thank you, Krusty.

49
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,190
Don't thank me.

50
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,775
Thank the Jewish Clown Awards
gift basket.

51
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,827
I'm a Mapple person!

52
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,649
We're all Mapple people.
- Sorry.

53
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,635
ANNOUNCER: Attention, Mapple universe.

54
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,005
Prepare for a live announcement
from Mapple Founder...

55
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,975
...and Chief Imaginative
Officer, Steve Mobs.

56
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,443
Steve Mobs!

57
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,511
He's a genius!

58
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,946
He's like a God who knows what we want!

59
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:11,284
Greetings. It is I.
Your insanely great leader, Steve Mobs.

60
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,854
I'm speaking to you from
Mapple headquarters deep below the sea...

61
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,257
...with an announcement
that will completely change...

62
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,825
...the way you look at everything.

63
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,794
And that announcement is...

64
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,730
BART: You're all losers!

65
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,098
Huh?

66
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,467
You think you're cool
because you buy a $500 phone...

67
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,935
...with a picture of a fruit on it?

68
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,037
Well, guess what?
They cost 8 bucks to make...

69
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,805
...and I pee on every one!

70
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,276
I have made a fortune off you chumps,

71
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,611
and I've invested it all in Microsoft.

72
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,949
Now my boyfriend Bill Gates and I kiss
each other on a pile of your money!

73
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,654
Traitor! Your heart is blacker
than your turtleneck!

74
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,101
Who dares question the boss we fired
10 years ago and then brought back?

75
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,870
It was my brother, Bart!

76
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,625
Flay him with your earbuds!
Flay him, I say!

77
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,300
MyCube, take me away!

78
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:17,247
Loving you
is easy 'cause you're beautiful

79
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,581
Get him! Get him good!

80
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:25,959
Stupid angry mob, chasing me because
I shine a harsh light on modern society.

81
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,328
Now I know how Dane Cook feels!

82
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,257
Mmm. What's that exotic aroma?

83
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:36,190
Smells like a hamburger
cooked at a rug store.

84
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,426
Hello. Would you like some lamb?

85
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,513
Whoa! All these years
I've been petting lambs...

86
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,682
...when I should've been shoving them
in my mouth!

87
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,251
I'm Bart.
- I'm Bashir.

88
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,720
My family and I just
moved here from Jordan.

89
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,422
Jordan. That's on some map
somewhere, right?

90
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,359
Bashir, introduce me to your new friend.

91
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,199
Bashir, you didn't tell
me you had a sister.

92
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,931
Such a charmer.

93
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,633
Would you like to stay for dinner?

94
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,133
Hey, I never refuse food from strangers.

95
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,206
Okay. You're new to our school,
so here's the deal.

96
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,841
We call Skinner, Skin Rash.

97
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,239
Mr. Wiener is Mr. Whiner.

98
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,647
And Groundskeeper Willie,
Grounds Creeper Stupid.

99
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,115
That's not clever.

100
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,284
And I have so many aspects you can mock.

101
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,053
I'm poor. I'm dirty.
I can't read or write.

102
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,621
I think movies are real.

103
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,791
Okay, next.

104
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,127
Here's the food at the cafeteria
that will make you sick.

105
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,663
Coleslaw, tuna, all chowders and gumbos.

106
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,831
The only thing that's safe
is the pork chops.

107
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,868
My religion says I can never eat pork.

108
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,038
A different religion?
Do not tell anyone that,

109
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,507
because if the bullies around here
find out that you're different...

110
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,607
JIMBO: Who's different?

111
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,627
What's your name, sweat stain?

112
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,272
Bashir.
- Bash Here?

113
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,782
I love a kid that comes with directions!

114
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,190
Okay, Bash Here,

115
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,794
tell us where you came from
so we can punch you back there.

116
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,698
I'm gonna punch you extra hard
because I secretly think you're cute!

117
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,765
Whoa! Whoa!

118
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,901
You can't just wail on him because he's...

119
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,669
What religion are you anyway?

120
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,304
Muslim.
- Oh, boy.

121
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,708
You're the reason I can't carry
toothpaste on an airplane!

122
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,808
Ow!

123
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,812
Look, guys. Everyone's different.

124
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,980
Jimbo, you're Christian.
Dolph, you're Jewish.

125
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,450
And Kearney,
your family's in that cult Moe started.

126
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,086
I had to join. My mom's doing the savior.

127
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,789
I mean, the one true Moe.
- You're the one true Moe.

128
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,766
Help me, oh, mighty Moe!
- I can't.

129
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,726
I'm not really a God. I
was just acting crazy...

130
00:07:50,826 --> 00:07:53,121
...to get out of jury duty.

131
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,043
Look at Lisa Simpson
over there by herself.

132
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,203
Not talking to us, her best friends.

133
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,447
Do we hate her?

134
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,582
Yes!
- Yes!

135
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,418
Lisa, we came to tell you that we...

136
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,884
Is that a MyPod?
- Yeah!

137
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,090
I've already downloaded
so much incredible music.

138
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,120
Check out Moon Dreams,
from Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool.

139
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,362

140
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,773
Or check out
this MyTunes exclusive episode...

141
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,374
...of Itchy and Scratchy.

142
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,875
Why?

143
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,527
Stop!

144
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,309
I love the nightlife

145
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,434
I've got to boogie

146
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,035
On the disco round

147
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,953
Marge, I installed all
the low energy bulbs.

148
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,855
MARGE: What have you done
with the old ones?

149
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:53,545
Disposed of them
in an environmentally-friendly manner.

150
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,599
Milhouse is looking good.

151
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,969
He's got contacts, changed color,
got a cool new catch phrase.

152
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,540
Dad, that's Bashir, my new friend.

153
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,893
Bart forgot this, sir.
- 'Sir'?

154
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,083
That's the kind of respect you'd have
to strangle out of an American kid.

155
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,853
You know, Bart never told me
he had a handsome teenage brother.

156
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,557
I'm really 38.

157
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,632
Thirty-eight waist I might believe.

158
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,532
Hey, Carl.
Got any idea what direction Mecca's in?

159
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,799
Why don't you ask Homer?

160
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,837
He ought to know
by dint of his son's new friend.

161
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,772
Hey, Bashir's great.

162
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,041
If Derek Jeter married Mariah Carey,

163
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,545
it wouldn't last,
but I bet they'd have a kid like him.

164
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,712
Homer, this is serious.

165
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,082
This Bashir kid is Muslim,
and therefore up to something.

166
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,851
Well, I can't believe that till I see...

167
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,254
...a fictional TV program
espousing your point of view.

168
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,354
All right.

169
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:00,693
For the last time, Fayed.
Where did you hide the nerve gas?

170
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:05,097
Under your Statue of Liberty's dress!
And she loved it!

171
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,427
Oh, my God. What can I do?

172
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,670
Well, if you want to stop Bashir
and his war on American principles,

173
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,106
you could discriminate against
his family in employment and housing.

174
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,743
Yeah, that's pretty patriotic.
But I got a better idea. Invite them over.

175
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,579
A little dinner, a little dessert.

176
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,848
Then you Jack Bauer them into giving you
all their secrets.

177
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,476
I guess I have no choice.

178
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,624
Homie, it's very open-minded of you...

179
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,227
...to have Bart's Muslim friend's
Muslim family over.

180
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,064
Here's the plan, Marge.
You keep them talking.

181
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,233
I'll be listening and quietly judging.

182
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:47,342
The doorbell will tell you
when they're here.

183
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,003
So, how did you two meet?

184
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:56,115
We met while studying at Jordan
University of Science and Technology.

185
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,283
Interesting.

186
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:03,503
Why just the other day, I was reading
that science is used to make bombs.

187
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,691
Now bait the trap.

188
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,795
Why don't I get us dessert?

189
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,195
I made us a little cake. Care to cut?

190
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,536
Watch this, Lenny.

191
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,374
Not now! I got soap in my eyes!

192
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,043
No. Thank you.

193
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,647
What's the matter?
Don't like the taste of freedom?

194
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,515
Dad, these people are my friends.

195
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,717
Don't fear them just because
they have a different religion,

196
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,886
a different culture
and their last name is bin Laden.

197
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,089
Young man, you do not respect us
by disrespecting your father.

198
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:40,960
I like the way you Italians think.
- Shut up, old man.

199
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,780
I think it is time for us to go.

200
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,422
That's it! Ruin a perfect evening!

201
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,671
You're teaching Bart
a terrible lesson of intolerance!

202
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,872
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,008
It's just so fun and easy to judge
people based on religion.

204
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,345
Well, I want you to go over
to their house and apologize.

205
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,949
But we're the more powerful country
for a few more years.

206
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,643
Okay. I'll apologize.

207
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,215
Don't eat that, sweetie. It's poison.

208
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:24,236
'I am sorry I suspected you of being
soulless murderers of innocent children.

209
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,481
'I hope we can move past this and...'

210
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,371
Dynamite? They are terrorists!

211
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,147
Must leave quietly.

212
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,316
So far, so good.

213
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,801
Marge, I was right!
Everybody is whatever I think they are!

214
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,836
I saw them unloading dynamite!

215
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:02,475
Homer, I'm sure you didn't see anything.
Go to sleep.

216
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,140
All right, sweetie.

217
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,980
But if I wake up tomorrow,
we'll discuss it.

218
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,256
Hi, Homer!

219
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,967
You rubbed. You must like me!
You really, really like me!

220
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,160
Good morning, Ramadan!

221
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,466
Come to Crazy Fayedi's!
Our prices are Hussein!

222
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,900
Here's Genie!

223
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,912
Now do Flanders!
- No.

224
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:44,092
Now I will destroy
your decadent western society.

225
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,764
No!

226
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,980
Usually that ends the dream.

227
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:11,117
The power of dreaming has convinced me
the threat is real!

228
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,182
Delivery for Lisa Simpson.

229
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,423
It's a gift from Mapple!

230
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,654
Such beautiful packaging.

231
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,749
I never thought a company
could be my soul mate.

232
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,223
It's my first MyBill.

233
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,554
$1,200?

234
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,599
But I only downloaded 1212 songs.

235
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,042
I gotta prove the genie was right.

236
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,544
Off to work.

237
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:49,048
Sometimes I wish you would quit
that awful business.

238
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,717
But I love blowing up buildings.

239
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,485
Oh, my God!

240
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,022
Safely and legally
in order to make room for new buildings.

241
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,290
Darling.

242
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,893
I think you're working much too hard.

243
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,895
Yes. I am killing myself.

244
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,697
But it is all for the profit.

245
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:09,217
And after the explosion,
I will be in a better place.

246
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,953
That corner office
with the downtown view.

247
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,851
Oh, it's you. What do you want?

248
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,723
I want to apologize for being
such a jerk at dinner.

249
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,992
And I thought the best way to do that...

250
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,028
...would be to come to your house
and poke around.

251
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,331
Mr. Simpson, I accept your apology.
Goodbye.

252
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,335
Wait, wait, wait, wait! I read somewhere
your people are hospitable to guests.

253
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,199
Is that true?
- Yes.

254
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,468
Praise be Oliver.
- That's Allah.

255
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,677
We'll look it up in the Corona.

256
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:58,910
So, now that we're alone,
death to America, right?

257
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,955
Homer, why are you really here?
- Look at that!

258
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,938
We're out of almond paste!

259
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,260
Don't get up! I'll grind
the almonds myself!

260
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
A computer.

261
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,565
I'm in.

262
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,247
They're gonna blow it up!

263
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,783
Homer, I don't hear almond grinding.

264
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,979
Just listen! I'm grinding them now.

265
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,590
Ow!

266
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,492
My finger!

267
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,994
Here comes the ambulance!

268
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,131
My, you're a handsome fellow.

269
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,969
Just get in the ambulance, Mr. Simpson.
We'll see to your finger.

270
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,136
Why, thank you.

271
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,739
My finger!

272
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,743
Everyone, get out!

273
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,479
Run for your lives!

274
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,514
Run for your...

275
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,850
Stay where you are.

276
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,020
Bart!

277
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,892
Boy, don't blow up this mall.

278
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:17,987
It has the cookie store
that gives free samples!

279
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,103
I can't believe your dad gets paid
to blow stuff up.

280
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,106
Actually, Bart, my job is about math
and engineering.

281
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,376
Every calculation is to make sure
the explosion is safe.

282
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:34,131
Did you factor in one bald idiot?
- No, I...

283
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,114
USA! USA! USA!

284
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,100
Dad, it was an empty building.
It was supposed to come down.

285
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,137
What about the bridge?
- That was supposed to open tomorrow.

286
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,039
Do we really need a bridge there?

287
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,114
The Duff brewery is on that island.

288
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,844
I'll save you!

289
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,730
That banner has really paid for itself
over the years!

290
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,498
We accept your apology.

291
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,468
Lisa, add another name
to our Christmas card list.

292
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,002
Next to our Jewish friends.

293
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,104
Where is Lisa?

294
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:40,344
She said something about the bottom
of the ocean and 'be back in a month.'

295
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,149
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to Mapple headquarters.

296
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:48,584
The cost of this journey
will be added to your bill.

297
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,716
Come on. Come on. Yes!

298
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,761
Sixteen million results!

299
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,796
Mr. Mobs, there's
a surface dweller here to see you.

300
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,330
MyTunes user Jazzgal62.

301
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,376
Lisa Simpson. Send her in.

302
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,617
Lisa! It's insanely great to see you.

303
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:16,044
Mr. Mobs, I sort of downloaded
too many songs onto my MyPod,

304
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,384
and I don't have the money
to pay for them.

305
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,255
And do you think you could consider
a reduced payment plan?

306
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,355
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:27,159
I know our posters say,
'Think differently,'

308
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,995
but our real slogan is, 'No refunds.'

309
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:36,101
Can't you open your Mapple menu
and click on the 'compassion bar'?

310
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,201
Oh, please?

311
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,773
Lisa, how would you like
to work for Mapple?

312
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,442
Would I ever!

313
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,542
Think differently.

314
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,677
Think differently.

315
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,946
Think differently.

316
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,284
Think differently.

317
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,272
English - US - SDH
