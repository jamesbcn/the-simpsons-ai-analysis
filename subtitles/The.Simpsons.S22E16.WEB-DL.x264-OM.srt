1
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:47,888
D'oh!

2
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:05,065
The Queen will be held
without bail

3
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,584
until the sample
is returned from the lab.

4
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:10,654
And now it's time
for "That's Kent-ertainment!"

5
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,420
Here's a story
that gives new meaning

6
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:28,155
to the words "puff piece."

7
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:30,390
Springfield natives
Cheech and Chong

8
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,360
are returning in triumph
for a reunion show.

9
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:35,762
Cheech and Chong are coming
back to Springfield?

10
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,848
Cheech and Chong
are from Springfield?

11
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,334
Lucy and Desi
are getting a divorce?

12
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,536
<i>Before they formed</i>
<i>their "joint" partnership,</i>

13
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,037
<i>Tommy Chong</i>
<i>and Richard "Cheech" Marin</i>

14
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,640
<i>briefly worked as Channel 6</i>
<i>meteorologists.</i>

15
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,509
Tomorrow, a
high-pressure front

16
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,345
brings a strong
possibility of drizzle.

17
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:54,414
<i>Then, the doobie of destiny</i>
<i>changed their lives forever,</i>

18
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,233
<i>when police</i>
<i>burned marijuana seized</i>

19
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:59,570
<i>from the Buddy Rich Orchestra</i>
<i>in a nearby lot.</i>

20
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:02,739
So, you know,
uh, check your barometer,

21
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:05,209
thermometer, anemometer...

22
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:07,544
Why does everything have
to have an "ometer" on it?

23
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:09,112
And what is rain, man?

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,615
It's like we're in the
apartment under God

25
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:13,984
and his fat sister
overflowed the tub.

26
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:18,422
The duo's herbal ha-has
led to a series

27
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,626
of successful albums, concerts,
movies and <i>Nash Bridges.</i>

28
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:26,280
Now these homegrown heroes
will kick off their summer tour

29
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,448
at Squidport's new amphitheatre,

30
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:32,019
<i>the Clamphitheater,</i>
<i>the $800 million boondoggle</i>

31
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:35,055
<i>based on nothing more</i>
<i>than a cute play on words.</i>

32
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:37,157
Who the hell
are Cheech and Chong?

33
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:39,109
Bart, Cheech and Chong

34
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:41,445
were the Beavis and Butthead
of their day.

35
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:42,913
Who are Beavis and Butthead?

36
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,732
I've failed as a parent.

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,018
I swore the day my son was born

38
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,920
he would appreciate
stoner comedy.

39
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:51,238
To the media room!

40
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,173
Open up.
It's the police.

41
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,442
Oh, man.
I got to get rid of my grass.

42
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:01,465
He's flushing his pot
down the toilet... unnecessarily!

43
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:07,988
Back then, we'd play
these albums again and again

44
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:11,258
till they were filled with skips
and clicks and pops.

45
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:13,093
Which was about three times.

46
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,795
These are comedy albums?

47
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,129
The Noisy Minority.

48
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:18,248
The Upside-Down
Bubblegum Collective.

49
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,716
The Regional Lampoon.

50
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,752
The Plymouth Grok Experiment.

51
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:22,953
Fro And Flo.

52
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,138
Allan Sherman's Helter Shmelter.

53
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,074
What are you guys doing up there?

54
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,275
Hide the dope!

55
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:29,476
We don't have any dope.

56
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,094
Then, what did I just smoke?

57
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,637
Lou, I want you to
confiscate these brownies.

58
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:42,089
There's no drugs
in these brownies.

59
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:43,657
I said "confiscate"!

60
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:47,661
Uh, also confiscate me
a T-shirt, uh triple-XL.

61
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:50,664
I thought you said double-XL
was a real wake-up call.

62
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,349
That was for pants.

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,618
Ladies and gentlemen,
Krusty the Clown.

64
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:55,986
Thank you.

65
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:57,771
When they asked me
to introduce Cheech and Chong,

66
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,606
I said, "How much?"

67
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:02,075
And they said, "We don't pay
for introductions,"

68
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,529
so I said, "Then I don't need
this crummy gig."

69
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:08,882
And they said, "Yes, you do,"
and I said...

70
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,667
"Ladies and gentlemen,
Cheech and Chong!"

71
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:15,605
Who is it?
It's me, Dave, man.

72
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,607
Open up.
I got the stuff.

73
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,376
I thought they'd do bits,

74
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,345
but their most famous bit?

75
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:23,647
Will you open up?
I got the stuff with me.

76
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:26,350
Ooh, he's gonna say
"Dave's not here."

77
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:29,052
Dave's not here!
Dave's not here!

78
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,687
Dave's not here!

79
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,289
Dave's not here!

80
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:33,490
Say the line, man.

81
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:34,925
They already know the line.

82
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,159
What's the surprise?

83
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:37,427
What's the point?

84
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,962
The point is they still give us

85
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,697
a shoebox full of 20s to do this.

86
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,516
Now, say it.

87
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,151
Dave's not...

88
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,486
Dave's not gonna sell out
anymore, man.

89
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,321
I-I can't say it.

90
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:52,292
What are you doing, man?!

91
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,543
What am I doing?
What am I...

92
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:54,995
I'm experimenting, man.

93
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:57,097
I'm growing as an artist, okay?

94
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:59,166
That's not the
Cheech and Chong brand.

95
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,584
Brand? Brand?

96
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:02,386
I'm a 72-year-old man.

97
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:04,454
I've eaten eggs every which way
they cook 'em.

98
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,423
I can't play it safe anymore.

99
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:09,509
Look, these people pay good
money to see "Dave's not here."

100
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,244
You owe them "Dave's not here."

101
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,979
Well, how about this?

102
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,716
Chong's not here, man.

103
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,037
Oh, no.

104
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,506
Chong is refusing to fall back

105
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:23,974
on his old catchphrases.

106
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,275
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

107
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,979
Homie, you know all the bits.

108
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:30,297
Maybe you could help him.

109
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,649
I can't do reefer comedy.
I'm drunk.

110
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:34,351
Two different animals.

111
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,536
Homer Simpson, that man's albums

112
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,755
have given you decades
of entertainment

113
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:41,625
and seen you through
some very square times.

114
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:42,893
Help him.

115
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:55,639
Dave's not here, man.

116
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,262
No, man, I'm Dave.

117
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,864
D-A-V-E.

118
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,065
Dave?

119
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,867
That's right.
Now open up the door.

120
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,985
Dave's not here, man.

121
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:17,377
You find this funny, sir?

122
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,213
Just because it's too hip
for you, Smithers...

123
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,554
I'll give Dave your message.

124
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:30,340
I don't find this funny at all.

125
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:34,211
My time being wasted
was not wasted.

126
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,548
Hey, man, you're all right.

127
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:40,517
How'd you like to
be the new Chong?

128
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:41,685
Yes.

129
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:42,769
Will I get to meet Dave?

130
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:43,820
There is no Dave.

131
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:45,071
How about Don Johnson?

132
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,389
It would be easier to meet Dave.

133
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:55,866
It is so cool for you to let me
go on tour with Cheech.

134
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:59,436
And remember, on the
road, the only vice

135
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:01,271
you can indulge in is gluttony.

136
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,141
Save lust and rage
for me and the kids.

137
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,076
Sweetie, don't worry.

138
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:09,146
I'm gonna come back
so horny and angry.

139
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:10,547
Aw...

140
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:13,383
I can't believe I'm riding
around in Cheech's van.

141
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,102
The van made of weed.

142
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,720
It's not made of weed.

143
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,021
Oh. What's it made of?

144
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:19,389
Hash? 'Shrooms?

145
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:22,309
Lysergic acid diethylamide?

146
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,112
No. The van is just made of van.

147
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,396
Oh...

148
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:27,981
Look, Homer, I really need you

149
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,483
to be on your game, you know?

150
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,451
A lot of our fans have
gone through rehab,

151
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,686
so they're much more critical.

152
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:34,121
Don't worry, Cheech.

153
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,957
I know all the classic bits
of you and Chong.

154
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,742
Don't say that name.
Now, you drive.

155
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,026
I have to go black out his face

156
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:41,578
on some T-shirts
with a Magic Marker.

157
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:43,247
Can we get high from the fumes?

158
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,848
No!

159
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:00,230
Okay, man, what I'm looking for
in a new Cheech

160
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:03,901
is someone who is, like,
open-minded and adventurous.

161
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,303
I haven't decided
about the mustache yet,

162
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:08,205
but you need your own suspenders.

163
00:08:08,273 --> 00:08:09,940
Snap, snap.

164
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:11,808
Our friendship died
with the first snap,

165
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:14,511
and you buried it
with the second.

166
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,780
You ever notice how your nose
makes boogers?

167
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,448
What's up with that?

168
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:20,250
Uh, next?

169
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:22,886
I can't pay the rent.

170
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,488
You must pay the rent.

171
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:26,340
I can't pay the rent.

172
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:27,674
You must pay the rent.

173
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:29,476
I'll pay the rent.

174
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:30,811
My hero.

175
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,597
Aw, who am I kidding?
I don't got the money.

176
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,382
Ooh... Next?

177
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,926
Zoom.

178
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:49,529
I am your substitute teacher,

179
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,164
Sister Mary Elephant.

180
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:53,467
Class, attention, attention,

181
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,435
class, class. Shut up.

182
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:56,603
Thank you.

183
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:57,938
Uh, no, man.

184
00:08:58,006 --> 00:08:59,706
No routines from the old regime.

185
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:02,342
Really? But Sister Mary's
no-nonsense attitude

186
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,344
is what inspired me
to become an educator.

187
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:06,680
Just let your freak
flag fly, man.

188
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,815
Well, I guess
as long as I fold it afterward

189
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,284
and don't display it at night...

190
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,787
Oh, perhaps I should improvise,
or do an improv?

191
00:09:13,855 --> 00:09:15,489
I want you to reinvent the wheel.

192
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,424
No, de-invent the wheel.

193
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:18,425
No.

194
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:20,894
"Re-unvent the whool."

195
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:22,829
Oh, I'll get my prop trunk.

196
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,931
A lot of people have cell phones,

197
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,733
but I like to eat healthy,

198
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:29,303
So I invented...
the celery phone.

199
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,438
Hello? Hello?

200
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:35,208
Wow. You are the un-funniest man
I've ever seen.

201
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:37,110
Which means, teaming up with you

202
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:38,812
would be totally
pushing the envelope.

203
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,347
Mother,
how did you get this number?

204
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:41,782
It's a prop phone.

205
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,650
Yes, I have your celery.

206
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,919
I took the limpest
stalk there was.

207
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:47,888
Stop it. Stop riffing.

208
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:48,988
The gig is yours.

209
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:54,444
Time to finally return
your father's overdue movies.

210
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:57,180
Is it really okay to just
drop them into the pit

211
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:58,715
where the Blockbuster used to be?

212
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,217
Got a better idea?

213
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,496
Um, hello.

214
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:14,097
I'm Marge Simpson.

215
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,400
I think I've given you money
a couple of times.

216
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:20,637
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't want the money back.

217
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:22,456
I just came for my dog.

218
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,133
Easter grass, Cable Ace Awards,

219
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,869
aquariums full of broken
pinball game parts,

220
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,005
popped but uneaten Jiffy Pop
still in the silver bubble,

221
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:42,259
sample-sized shampoos,
detergents and whiskeys, and...

222
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:44,895
I hate to say this
about the Cat Lady,

223
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,763
but I think she's crazy.

224
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,498
She's a hoarder.

225
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:51,852
This is so sad.

226
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,969
Can we help her?

227
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:55,005
We can. It'll be great.

228
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:57,307
Like a reality show
without the cameras.

229
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,526
You mean, just reality.

230
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:00,994
Yeah, that's what you think.

00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:02,913

this was gonna be fun.

It is fun!

246
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,153

315

of how Chicano poster art
preserves a culture ignored

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,015

00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,318

Ladies and gentlemen, man.

324
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,967
Prepare for comedy

325
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:47,002
that will murder
your expectations

326
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,104
and bury them
in a sea of "what?"

327
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:51,673

328
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,378
I am Dave.

329
00:15:58,147 --> 00:16:00,649
Dave is here. Man.

330
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:04,119
Skinner, his dessert
menu is funnier than you.

331
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:06,888
Yeah.

332
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:09,758
Yes, but I'm funnier
than the cocktail napkins.

333
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:11,226
They're blank, Seymour.

334
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:14,363
Yes, but there are two "K"
sounds in cocktail.

335
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,564
Yes, there are.

336
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:19,584
So, how was <i>your</i>
first day of school?

337
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:21,569
I met the new principal,
Mr. Baumgartner.

338
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,071
He seemed really cool.

339
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:25,590
When he walked through the gym,
he shot a basket.

340
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:47,312
Who has disturbed my tomb?

341
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,581
Grampa, you're not dead.

342
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,350
Well, wake me when I am.

343
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:54,786
I never thought I'd say this,

344
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:57,823
but Dad is the only
one who can help us.

345
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,943
Now, Homer, what did we agree

346
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:03,779
about personal phone calls
during rehearsal time?

347
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:07,549
It's disrespectful
to the high standards

348
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:10,352
people have come to expect
from Cheech and Chunk.

349
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,254
That's right. Now let's take it
from the part

350
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,455
where we sniff
each other's butts.

351
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:14,139
Yes, sir.

352
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,440
Come on, sniff!

353
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:19,044
That's a movie sniff.

354
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:20,712
This is live theater.

355
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,797
Now inhale, damn it.

356
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:27,402
I'm hearing it,
but I'm not feeling it.

357
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,254
Oh!

358
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:36,943
Ugh! Okay, bus parked.
Got to save Marge.

359
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:42,415
I can't believe the crazy house
would throw out all these forks.

360
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:45,351
Marge, sweetie,

361
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,970
do you know how low,
low prices are insane?

362
00:17:48,971 --> 00:17:51,439
Well, sometimes
people can be, too.

363
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:52,940
What are you talking about?

364
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,809
Marge, you saved me.

365
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,377
Now I want to save you.

366
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:58,412
I'm not a hoarder.

367
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,481
Do the Yankees <i>hoard</i> pennants?

368
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,451
Does Marrakesh <i>hoard</i> intrigue?

369
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,903
Marge, Marge, what can one person

370
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,221
honestly do with...?

371
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:10,524
Filled-in mini
golf score sheets.

372
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,878
European ketchup.

373
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,414
Rolls of "I voted" stickers.

374
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:23,253
Styrofoam shaped
like old computers!

375
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:24,605
Oh!

376
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:27,408
Give me!

377
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:28,609
Oh, lookie, lookie!

378
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:30,178
Oh! Ooh! Ooh!
But...

379
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:32,544
Don't look back, Marge.
Don't look back.

380
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:35,924
Let's just leave the crazy
woman alone in our house.

381
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:38,502
We've got something
more important to attend to.

382
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:45,453
Uh, we'll deal with all that later.

383
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:56,802
Baby, wanna ride?

384
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:59,903
Come on. If Art Garfunkel
could forgive that

385
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:01,496
on talented twarp Paul Simon,

386
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:03,023
you can do this.

387
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,031
Whatcha do with Chong, man?

388
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,752
He sent me out here, man.

389
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:17,920
He's got this idea I'm unhappy
with my new partner.

390
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,558
I decided to put family over career.

391
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:22,882
You mean you put nothing over nothing?

392
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:27,307
Tell him how you feel.

393
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:30,583
- I feel super high.
- Yeah, me too.

394
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,383
Come on, surrender to the moment.

395
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,072
Don't make the mistake I always do.

396
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,634
I'm thinking too much before you act.

397
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,284
I guess people do like the classy bits.

398
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:47,349
You know, it's...

399
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,329
It's ok if you want
to experiment a little...

400
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:53,363
- Oh, Thomas...
- Oh, Richard.

401
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:00,873
I'm sorry I mocked your lack of suspenders.

402
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:03,130
I guess I was just jealous of your belt.

403
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,818
This belt has caused
too many fights between us.

404
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,360
Hello, mad spirits.

405
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,684
Before we parts, it is I,
mischievous and puckish Bart.

406
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,559
T'was not I that players did disturb.

407
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,120
T'was the doings of a grim and naught herd.

408
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,898
The gods have righted every wrong.

409
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,146
Cheech the stoner has his Cho'ong.

410
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:34,080
And Homer, he is back with mom,

411
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,813
you can watch us tomorrow at Hulu.com.

412
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,452
Who is it?

413
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:46,185
It's me, Dave, man.
Open up, I got the stuff.

414
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,546
- Who?
- Dave, man.

415
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,716
Dave's not here.

416
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:51,135
Hold on, let me get the door here.

417
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,174
- Who are you?
- It's Dave, man.

418
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,907
You ruined it, man.
You weren't supposed to open the door.

419
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:57,569
Oh, okay, wait.
We start again.

420
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,563
- Close the door.
- I'll be out here with you, Dave.

421
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:03,371
- Hey, Homer, why don't you go and
get us some stuff? - Okay.

422
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:04,588
I'll go get some stuff.

423
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,365
Get down there.
Way way way far. Down there.

424
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:09,711
- Down here?
- Yeah, keep going, keep going.

425
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,667
Now turn the corner, turn the corner.

426
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,803
- Okay. Alright.
- Now keep going.

427
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,617
- Who is it?
- It's me, relieved.

428
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:24,934
Gee, sorry, Dave.
