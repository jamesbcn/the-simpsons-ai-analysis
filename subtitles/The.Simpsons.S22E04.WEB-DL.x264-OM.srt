1
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:10,739
Why, you little...

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,429
Beneath this smile,
I'm in awful, awful pain!

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,251
Welcome, precious
primetime viewers,

4
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:27,422
valued Internet downloaders,
and scary digital pirates!

5
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,258
If you want to shield
your little darlings

6
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:33,244
from our stomach-churning
holiday special,

7
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:36,080
simply hit fast-forward
on your DVR remote...

8
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:50,678
I went too far!

9
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,397
Spoiled the whole
show for everybody!

10
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:55,450
I don't deserve
to wield the remote.

11
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:57,702
Oh, I'm getting old and gray...

12
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,038
I'm dead.

13
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:07,061
Monster go watch <i>The Office.</i>

14
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:11,666
Dunder-Mifflin just like
monster's workplace.

15
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,069
Milhouse, do we have enough
points for a weapons upgrade?

16
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:49,222
Yeah! We really racked them up
eating all those elf babies.

17
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,008
Ha-ha! Nothing beats
a weapon made of weapons.

18
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:58,598
This is that video game Reverend
Lovejoy said you shouldn't play.

19
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,283
Well, <i>he's</i> playing
it right now.

20
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:02,335
Slay the wounded!

21
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:04,604
I still think it's too violent.

22
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:07,123
It's a game. We're
not hurting anybody.

23
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:08,858
My non-lazy eye!

24
00:02:08,926 --> 00:02:10,593
Ooh.

25
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:14,163
These classic board
games are fun <i>and</i> safe.

26
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,133
My other eye!

27
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,005
So which of these
"board lames" shall we play?

28
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:23,056
Taffy Land?

29
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:24,057
Drops and Risers?

30
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:25,091
Consternation?

31
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,426
Ravenous, Ravenous Rhinos?

32
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:27,660
Mouse Catch?
Battleboat?

33
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:28,962
Funopoly?
Crate of Apes?

34
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:30,463
Yahtzu?
Tiddlywonks?

35
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:34,033
Hey, I've never seen
this one before.

36
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:35,969
Satan's Path?

37
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:38,688
Hey, it's got to be good
if Satan put his name on it.

38
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,092
Huh?

39
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,028
Here. I'll be the demon,
you be the thimble.

40
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:46,529
Oh, I'm always
the thimble.

41
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:51,985
One...

42
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:56,122
Two.

43
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:57,123
Ooh!

44
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,800
There was a bank
error in my favor.

45
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:10,870
And I'm spending it all on
Oriental Avenue prostitutes!

46
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,645
All the games came to life!

47
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,455
I don't like the looks
of that knight, Chief.

48
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:30,890
Don't worry.
We're safe.

49
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,159
He's two steps away,
and one to the right.

50
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:40,984
For me, it's game,
set... and match.

51
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,219
I think you mean
"check, and mate."

52
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,121
Just got crushed by
a giant horse, Lou.

53
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:47,290
You want to cut me a break?

54
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,694
Time to meet my mystery dude.

55
00:03:58,252 --> 00:03:59,852
Ah.

56
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:03,740
Oh, man, I'm never coming down!

57
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:04,757
Ah!

58
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,592
Whoo-hoo! Another ladder!

59
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,744
Riding high!

60
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:09,112
Sinking low!

61
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:10,530
Top of the heap!

62
00:04:10,581 --> 00:04:12,265
Oh! Down I go!

63
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:13,883
On top for good!

64
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:15,785
Oh, cruel hubris!

65
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,641
How do we make this stop?

66
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,209
Well, my Latin's
a little rusty,

67
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:25,244
but I think to get everything
back in its box,

68
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:26,462
you have to finish the game.

69
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,365
And if we don't finish?

70
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:32,035
You're going to have to deal
with more nonsense like that.

71
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:35,722
Yatszu.

72
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,257
Here we go,
back in the cup.

73
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,476
At least the cup
is lined with felt.

74
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:42,478
Hey, Mr. Positive,
shut the hell up.

75
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,143
We'll be safe on
this Battleboat.

76
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:59,328
Set a course for B-7.

77
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:05,168
B-7.

78
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:06,469
They dunked our Battleboat!

79
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:08,604
I wish I could see
my mom one last time,

80
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:10,606
so I can say,
"This is all your fault!"

81
00:05:10,674 --> 00:05:14,994
Colonel Ketchup, I say
it was you that killed him

82
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,730
in the parlor,
with the letter-opener!

83
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:21,901
He was going to leave me, and
I'm too old to find anyone else.

84
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,737
Come on, man, climb up!

85
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:26,739
No. I might sink the letter.

86
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:29,125
And "Q" is just too valuable.

87
00:05:29,193 --> 00:05:30,693
That blank could be
any letter we want.

88
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:34,447
Maybe I'm just tired of living.

89
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:42,121
The final challenge: Mousecatch.

90
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:44,423
A game so lame,
no one's ever finished it.

91
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:51,063
Crazy Eights!

92
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,398
Think, Bart. Think!

93
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:55,001
What was that lesson I
learned from video games?

94
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,220
Oh, yeah! Kill, kill, kill!

95
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:02,909
There comes a time to beat
the crap out of childish things.

96
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,328
Sure is a hard way
to catch a mouse.

97
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:29,802
Oh, this stupid
thing never works.

98
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,752
That's it. From now on,
we'll just play Hangman.

99
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,820
Wait, wait.

100
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:49,438
We still got one more letter.

101
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:51,307
Is it... 3?

102
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,743
That's not a letter.

103
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,562
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

104
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,164
Man, it's been a crazy morning.

105
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:21,587
Champagne?

106
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,825
Oh, Homie, what
a great idea--

107
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,227
to take a cruise
in uncharted waters.

108
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:29,780
Yeah, charts are
for squares, baby.

109
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:37,087
Whew. Sure is hot out here.

110
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:38,355
Mmm.

111
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,057
Mmm.

112
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:41,992
Oh, that's my cell phone.

113
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:45,862
What is it?

114
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,115
Lenny, I'm on a
second honeymoon!

115
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,417
You'll have to pick
your own Lotto numbers.

116
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:52,286
Now, where were we?

117
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:58,191
Oh, baby, let's give
those seagulls

118
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,726
something to squawk about.

119
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:03,230
Huh?

120
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:05,065
Oh yeah, baby, I like
it when you're distracted.

121
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:06,066
Huh?

122
00:08:10,454 --> 00:08:11,755
Homie, help him up.

123
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:14,625
Fine. I'll get the hook.

124
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:18,095
Don't fight it.

125
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:20,314
Don't... That's it.

126
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:22,416
A little more.

127
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:24,468
How's that?

128
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,838
You're safe now, my friend.

129
00:08:27,905 --> 00:08:29,973
This poor man must have
been out there for days.

130
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,644
He's nothing but
hard, bronze muscle.

131
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,647
Bless you.

132
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:41,385
Okay, this guy's
taken care of.

133
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:43,353
So... uh, you know...

134
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,389
I'm not really in
the mood anymore.

135
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,858
Fine. I'm going for a walk.

136
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:08,412
My name's Roger.

137
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,747
I was the chef on the <i>Albatross,</i>
working for a businessman

138
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,116
taking his partners to Tahiti.

139
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:16,870
One night, he asked
for pie for dessert...

140
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:19,856
<i>As the pie cooled innocently</i>
<i>on a porthole sill,</i>

141
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:23,410
<i>my employer attempted</i>
<i>to inject it with poison.</i>

142
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:25,879
<i>But I caught him in the act.</i>

143
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:28,865
<i>Unfortunately, he had the</i>
<i>strength of ten businessmen.</i>

144
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,202
<i>He sent me napward with a</i>
<i>bottle of low-sodium soy sauce.</i>

145
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,439
Poor man. You've been
through so much.

146
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:38,358
Hey. I've had a hard trip, too.

147
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:41,361
One of the lenses fell
out of my sunglasses!

148
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:44,464
Ah... oh, yeah...

149
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:47,901
Oh, Roger, you really
know what you're doing.

150
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:52,572
No luck.

151
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:58,328
Anyway, when I came to,
everyone on board was dead.

152
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:02,332
<i>I fled the horrific scene.</i>

153
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,452
<i>And after days at sea,</i>

154
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,354
<i>I found my savior.</i>

155
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:08,688
<i>You, Marge.</i>

156
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:12,092
And, in a very insignificant
way, you, Homer.

157
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,794
God, it was horrible.

158
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:17,130
Marge? Can I have a word
with you in private?

159
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,866
I don't trust that guy.

160
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:22,069
I bet he killed everyone
on that boat himself.

161
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:23,870
That's crazy talk.

162
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:25,972
Excuse me.

163
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,108
You've both been so kind to me,

164
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:32,112
I baked you this pie.

165
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,881
That is so sweet.

166
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:38,201
Why do piemakers
get all the girls?

167
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,854
Why did you do that?

168
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:42,105
It was poisoned!
No it wasn't!

169
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,557
Well, it was rhubarb.

170
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:44,741
No, it was berry-peach.

171
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,726
Berry-peach?
That's my favorite!

172
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:50,430
Please, Homer. I am so sick of
this unmotivated jealous--

173
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:57,888
The pie was poisoned.
You were right.

174
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:01,224
I guess we've got to kill
him before he kills us.

175
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:04,628
Well, we'd better do it quick,
because he's making scones!

176
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,651
They should call this one
"Recipe For Murder."

177
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,153
What do you mean,
"this one"?

178
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:14,087
Never mind.

179
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:23,480
Oh, Roger, would you
hand me the suntan oil?

180
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,107
Ooh, got a text.

181
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:35,342
Now!

182
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:40,547
Dear God.

183
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:42,549
We just killed a man.

184
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:45,719
Yeah, the decent thing
to do is bury him at sea.

185
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:54,060
Come and get it, barnacles.

186
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:03,420
Huh?

187
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,235
Roger <i>was</i> telling
the truth.

188
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:19,603
This proves nothing.

189
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,172
Roger could've been the
one that killed them.

190
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,640
Soy sauce.

191
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,976
Low sodium.

192
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,646
Then his story
<i>was</i> true.

193
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:31,948
We killed an innocent man.

194
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:33,583
We're murderers.

195
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:35,435
Murderers!

196
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,940
Well, if it isn't my saviors.

197
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:43,994
Hey, pal, how you been?

198
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:45,612
Don't you "pal" me.

199
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,714
Why did you try
to kill me?!

200
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:50,917
The pie you baked us
killed that shark!

201
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:52,869
The pie was clean.

202
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:55,355
The shark died from the fuel
leaking out of your boat.

203
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,506
It...

204
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,124
Oh, yeah.

205
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:59,175
Oops.

206
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:00,510
Oh, goody.

207
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:03,363
The monkey got ahold
of a spear gun.

208
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:08,251
Why did you do that?!

209
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:11,888
We had to kill him or he'd tell
people we tried to kill him.

210
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,290
What the devil's going on here?

211
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,791
You're alive?

212
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:18,228
Yes. I suspected our host
would poison us,

213
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:20,530
so I gave everyone
an antidote before dinner.

214
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:23,900
Looks like you've got a
flair for avoiding death.

215
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:26,186
Oh, come on.

216
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,621
Just a second.

217
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:33,159
Bankers away!

218
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:45,705
I repeat: no one
will ever know.

219
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:48,041
We'll know.

220
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:51,394
Marge, what are
you doing?!

221
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:52,295
That pie is
poisoned!

222
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:56,466
I can't live with the guilt.

223
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:02,572
She just wanted to ride
bikes through New England.

224
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,208
But those seats hurt my ass.

225
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:15,952
Ever wonder what
she thinks about?

226
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,421
Just sugarplums
and buttercups.

227
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:12,705
Hey, what's that weird look
on all those girls' faces?

228
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:15,674
It's something you've
never seen: they're smitten.

229
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:16,775
Oh, I've seen it.

230
00:15:16,843 --> 00:15:18,677
Especially when I do this.

231
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:26,318
Well, he is cute.

232
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:29,088
But I'm sure a boy like him
would never say hello to me.

233
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:30,122
Hello.

234
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:32,991
I love your pallor.

235
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:36,695
Why is there a steering wheel
in my bedroom?

236
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:41,750
How'd you do that?

237
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:45,487
Oh, it's these cheap school buses,
with their squishy metal.

238
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:48,791
On another subject,
you have beautiful eyes.

239
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:51,627
They're just dots in circles.

240
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,438
What?

241
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:03,689
Me again?

242
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:08,327
Come with me.

243
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:21,573
You're a vampire.

244
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:24,243
I should be scared,
but I'm not.

245
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,413
Let us move between the trees
the way a bat does: by jumping.

246
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:37,623
Lisa's fallen for a vampire?

247
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,825
That makes me so angry!

248
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:43,595
I feel the change coming!

249
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:48,817
Edmund's almost here,

250
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:50,452
so, please,
nobody be themselves.

251
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,037
I know, I know.

252
00:16:52,105 --> 00:16:54,723
Don't serve garlic, don't
stab your guest in the heart

253
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,743
with a wooden stake, don't ask
him if he knows Frankenstein.

254
00:16:57,811 --> 00:16:59,845
It's racist somehow.

255
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:05,067
Sorry, my Dad
insisted on coming.

256
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:09,388
Dad, I don't need a chaperone.

257
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,557
I'm 400 years old.

258
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:12,958
You live in my crypt,

259
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:14,860
you play by my rules.

260
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:17,296
You're tearing me apart!

261
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:18,931
Dinner is served.

262
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:20,933
I tried to make what
Homer said you liked.

263
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,835
I get the drumstick!

264
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:31,793
Okay, okay.

265
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:35,697
If a mosquito bites you, does
it become a vampire, too?

266
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:36,832
Yes.

267
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,267
Okay, okay.

268
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,469
If you bite your tongue,
does it become a vampire?

269
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:43,105
Look, I'm more than
just a vampire.

270
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:45,007
I'm a nut
for Dixieland jazz.

271
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:52,497
You said you weren't
going to bring that.

272
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:54,299
I said I <i>might</i> not.

273
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:59,054
They say vampires
live forever,

274
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:01,757
but I die of
embarrassment every day.

275
00:18:01,824 --> 00:18:03,458
I know just how you feel.

276
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,447
Let's fly, Lisa.

277
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:12,200
Keep your mouth closed,
or you'll swallow a lot of bugs.

278
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:15,537
Get them back!

279
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:17,005
She can't get neck holes.

280
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:18,640
It's picture day tomorrow!

281
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:21,493
Man, you vamps got it made.

282
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,078
You sleep all day...

283
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,913
And, because we only
drive at night,

284
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:27,249
we can really time the
traffic lights. Watch.

285
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,668
Green. Green. Green.

286
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:31,086
Boom. Green.

287
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,738
Yes. Boom.

288
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:34,790
Green. Good. Boom.

289
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:41,213
Boy, this place has every kind
of vampire there is.

290
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,137
Excuse me.

291
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:50,589
Have you seen these kids?

292
00:18:50,657 --> 00:18:52,074
I did.

293
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,142
And they were sneaking kisses.

294
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,644
One kiss!

295
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:57,079
Ha, ha, ha.

296
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,680
Two kisses!

297
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:00,082
Ha, ha, ha.

298
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:01,516
Three kisses!

299
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:02,517
There they are.

300
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:06,788
Super-Team, fly!

301
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,575
I'm Dracula, not The Hulk.

302
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:12,311
Hyah! Hyah!

303
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:21,036
Bite me now, Edmund,
and we'll both be vampires.

304
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:23,588
Get your neck away
from my son's teeth,

305
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:25,040
you evil temptress.

306
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:28,393
Sir, I'm not trying to take
your son away from you.

307
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,562
I plan to be a part of
your rich culture,

308
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,131
and organize media-friendly
events to help combat

309
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:35,267
all the unfair
vampire stereotypes.

310
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:37,569
Wow. Wow!

311
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:39,655
Now I know what you see
in this girl.

312
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:40,822
Bite her, my son,

313
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,507
and you both will be
eight forever.

314
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:44,326
Eight forever?

315
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:46,161
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

316
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:48,997
I can't spend eternity
using kid scissors.

317
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:50,399
They barely cut anything.

318
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:52,500
Too late!

319
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:53,885
The bloodlust
is upon me.

320
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:56,738
Back off, you unholy dreamboat!

321
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:03,912
Pretty ironic-- a cross
being used to kill someone.

322
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:12,004
Father, you're hurt.

323
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:15,340
Yes, but at least
you are safe, my son.

324
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:19,444
Whoa, you blood-sucking
freaks love your kids, too?

325
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:22,848
I remember when he was a baby,
I'd sneak up to his crib

326
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:24,783
in the middle of the day
to make sure

327
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:26,651
he was still not breathing.

328
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:29,705
No...!

329
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:32,207
Well, nobody loves his kids
more than me!

330
00:20:33,426 --> 00:20:34,476
Come and get it!

331
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,680
Die, fatso!

332
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:39,915
Uh-oh.

333
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:42,117
His blood-- it's
full of cholesterol.

334
00:20:42,185 --> 00:20:43,385
And not the good kind.

335
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,206
Woo-hoo!

336
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:49,674
Uh, Dad?

337
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:51,476
They turned you
into a vampire.

338
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:53,111
Yes! I can fly!

339
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:54,379
See you back
at the house.

340
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:57,032
Uh-oh.

341
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,150
No...!
