00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,980
Oh, brother.

179
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,146
(fart noise)

180
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,150
(laughing)

181
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,941
Mrs. Krabapple,
that was uncalled for.

182
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,435
(grumbling)

183
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,947
Bravo!

184
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,818
Well done, old man.

185
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:52,869
Hmm.

186
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,945
<i>Rod, Todd, this is God.</i>

187
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,037
How did you get
on the radio?

188
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,872
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>"how did I get on the radio"?</i>

189
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,128
<i>I created the universe,</i>
<i>stupid kids.</i>

190
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,170
Forgive my brother.

191
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,633
We believe you.

192
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,712
Talk is cheap.

193
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,167
Perhaps a test
of thy faith.

194
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,177
Walk through the wall.

195
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,509
I will remove it for you...

196
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,894
<i>...later.</i>
(laughing)

197
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,472
What do you want from us?

198
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,847
<i>I got a job for thee.</i>

199
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,983
Bring forth all the
cookies from your kitchen

200
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,060
<i>and leave them</i>
<i>on the Simpsons' porch.</i>

201
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,055
But those cookies belong
to our parents.

202
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,897
<i>(frustrated sigh)</i>
<i>Look, do you want a happy God</i>

203
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,904
<i>-or a vengeful God?</i>
-Happy God.

204
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,606
<i>Then quit flapping your lip,</i>
<i>and make with the cookies!</i>

205
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,276
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

206
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,332
(whistling)

207
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,414
Whoops.

208
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,916
(humming)

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,590
BART:
<i>Help! Help!</i>

210
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,208
Sounds like trouble a-brewing
at the old well!

211
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,757
<i>Help me, please.</i>

212
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,170
<i>I fell down the well!</i>

213
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,878
I'll get help,
laddie.

214
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,928
A little nip of courage.

215
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,188
Out of my way!

216
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,191
Look out, you horse's arse!

00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,443
(laughing)

218
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,484
Sucker.

219
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,280
Huh?
Hey, what's up?

220
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,702
Some poor kid
fell down a well.

221
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,661
Yes!

222
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,909
(high-pitched voice)
My name is Timmy O'Toole.

223
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,456
<i>I just turned ten years old.</i>

224
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,119
Timmy, where are
your parents?

225
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,787
<i>Uh... I have no family.</i>

226
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,497
<i>I tried to enroll in school,</i>

227
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,627
<i>but your Principal Skinner</i>
<i>turned me away</i>

228
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,844
<i>-because of my shabby clothes.</i>
-(crowd gasps)

229
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,804
He's a liar.

230
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,514
(crowd booing)

231
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,764
The circumference
of the well is 34 inches.

232
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,387
So, unfortunately,

233
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,814
not one member of our
city's police force

234
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,312
is slender enough
to rescue the boy.

235
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,654
By God, men,
you're a bunch of marshmallows.

236
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,771
Why don't
you go, Chief?

237
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,857
Well, I'm too f...

238
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,441
-...important.
-(scoffs)

239
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,856
Although the well
is too dark to see the boy,

240
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,445
Timmy has told us his foot
is trapped under a rock.

241
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,741
Thus any attempt
to pull him up

242
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,735
{\an8}would snap him like a twig.

243
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,197
In desperation,
the city is considering

244
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,077
more unorthodox solutions.

245
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,924
Grasping the child
firmly in his talons,

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,340
Socrates here will
fly him to safety.

247
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,499
Just watch.

248
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,008
{\an8}(screeches)

249
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,223
I don't think
he's coming back.

250
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,473
With this hook
and this hunk of chocolate,

251
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,136
I'll land your boy,

252
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,095
and I'll clean him for free.

253
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,475
Although we can't reach
the boy,

254
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,521
we can freeze him
with liquid nitrogen

255
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:33,395
so that future generations
can rescue him.

256
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:37,664
Dear Lord, before we peel
the foil back from your bounty,

257
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,948
we ask you to watch over
little Timmy O'Toole

258
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,663
trapped in that well.

259
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,083
(Bart laughing loudly)

260
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,162
Bart, what's wrong with you?

261
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,958
Yeah, that Timmy
is a real hero.

262
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,501
How do you mean, Dad?

263
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:54,174
Well, he fell down a well
and can't get out.

264
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,045
How does that
make him a hero?

265
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,882
Well, it's more
than you did.

266
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,087
<i>And finally, Channel 6's own</i>

<i>"We're Sending Our Love</i>

271
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,572
I wanted to do something
to help that boy.

272
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,188
so I called my
good friend Sting.

273
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,395
He said "Krusty,
when do you need me?"

274
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,105
I said, "Thursday."

275
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,905
He said,
"I'm busy Thursday."

276
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,319
I said,
"What about Friday?"

277
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,407
He said, "Friday's worse
than Thursday."

278
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,912
Then he said,
"How about Saturday?"

279
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,405
I said "Fine."

00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,656
True story.

281
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,208
Yeah. I used to open
for Krusty in '69.

282
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,462
In fact, he fired me

00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,161
(grunting)

353
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,495
(yells)

354
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,540
Hey. Almost tripped
over this thing.

355
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,536
(screaming)

356
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,758
Ugh!

357
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,757
(groaning)

358
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,255
What did I do to deserve this?

359
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,058
Help! Help!

360
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,811
I fell down the well.

361
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,233
Tell us something
we don't know.

362
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,941
(policemen laughing)

363
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,111
No, my name is Bart Simpson.

364
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,191
What are you doing
down there?

365
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,446
Look, I'll level with you.

366
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,199
There is no Timmy O'Toole.

367
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,410
It was just a prank
I was playing on everybody.

368
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,873
Well, you sure
fooled us, kid.

369
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,464
Hey, I got an idea
for a prank.

370
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,379
Let's go home
and go to sleep.

371
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,248
(laughing)

372
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,835
Good one, Eddie.

373
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,130
Ha, ha. Great joke, guys.

374
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,344
(fake laughing)

375
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,136
-Guys?
-(wolf howls in distance)

376
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,680
So I'm afraid your son
is trapped down the well.

377
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,975
You must think we're the worst
parents in the world.

378
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,900
Yes, that's pretty much
the feeling down at the station.

379
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,690
Don't worry, son.
Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole

380
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,987
doesn't mean you can't live
a rich and full life.

381
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,411
I brought you your Krusty doll.

382
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,450
Ow!

383
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,453
Knock it off, you bald boob!

384
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,035
Hey! Don't make me
come down there!

385
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,250
Like to see you fit.

386
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,459
Why you little--

387
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,749
-Put a man on him.
-(grunting)

388
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,673
I like the other boy.

389
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,962
So polite.

390
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,205
What are you doing
to save my baby boy?

391
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,838
Well, ma'am, we've located
a piece of machinery

392
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,175
in Shreveport,
Louisiana

393
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,720
that could pop him out
lickety-split.

394
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,394
Well, why don't you get it?

395
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,483
Well, I'm afraid we've
got a budget problem, Mrs. Simpson.

396
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,888
Your boy picked a bad time
to fall down a well.

397
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,807
Had he done it at the start of
the fiscal year, no problemo.

398
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,477
You're telling me
that the city won't pay

399
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,315
to get a boy
out of a well?

400
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,070
Well they would have for Timmy.
People love that little guy.

401
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,993
But your son, well, he kinda
played us all for a bunch of saps.

402
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,494
Mmm...

403
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,745
So it seems we've all been
the victims of a cruel hoax

404
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,408
perpetrated by
a ten-year-old hooligan.

405
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,998
The time has come
for finger pointing,

406
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,833
and most of them
are squarely aimed

407
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,248
at the boy's parents.

408
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,456
<i>It's not our fault.</i>

409
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,545
<i>We didn't want the boy.</i>

410
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,670
<i>He was an accident.</i>

411
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,966
<i>Homer!</i>

412
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,049
<i>Could you edit</i>
<i>that last part out?</i>

413
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,594
Mr. Simpson, we're live,

00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,257

And our new number one hit,
"I Do Believe We're Naked"

424
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,326
by Funky See, Funky Do

425
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,622
replaces "We're Sending
Our Love Down the Well,"

426
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,246
which plunges
all the way down to number 97.

427
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,165
Ever since I called
for the rescue

428
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,764
of that Simpson lad,
I have taken a lot of heat,

429
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,800
so I am flip-flopping.

430
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,513
I say let him stay down there.

431
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,684

432

433
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,477
Yeah, Shutton here.

434
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,441
Now that's a story.

435
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,121
Bart, honey, I made you
an extra warm sweater

436
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,949
you can wear while
you're down in the well.

437
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,745
Mom, it's too big.

438
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,459
Don't worry,
you'll grow into it.

439
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,619
Homer!

440
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,617
You know, I've done

441
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,248
a lot of bad stuff
through the years.

442
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,674
I guess now
I'm paying the price,

443
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,673
but there's so many things
I'll never get a chance to do.

444
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,376
Smoke a cigarette,

445
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,136
Use a fake I.D.,

446
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,758
Shave a swear word
in my hair...

447
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,137
(sniffling)

448
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,515
That's all I can stands.
I can't stands no more.

449
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,524
I'm going to get you
out of there myself.

450
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,862
(Homer grunting)

451
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,237
Now why didn't I think of that?

452
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,624

458
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,811

hole digging.

died of natural causes.

take a rest.
