a surprise today.

{\an8}We're going to take a test.

{\an8}All right! A test!

20
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,868
{\an8}It's called the Career Aptitude
Normalizing Test--

21
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,083
{\an8}or "CAN'T."

22
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,623
{\an8}Some of you may discover

23
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,826

{\an8}In spite of your masters
from Bryn Mawr,

26
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,383
{\an8}you might end up a glorified

{\an8}"If I could be any animal,
I would be:

"I prefer the smell of:

I could arrange for you

64

for a night.

Hey! I don't need you to get me
in the back of a police car.

66
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,122
I really think you should
consider this.

67
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,666
You know, before I saw
these test results,

68
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,539
I had you pegged as a drifter.

69
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,166
Wow. A drifter.

70
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,803
Lousy sheriff.

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,760
Run me out of town.

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,590
He's lost my vote.

73
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,638
Cool.

74
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,181
LISA:
A homemaker!

75
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,684
I might as well be dead.

76
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,596
Lisa, it's not that bad.

77
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,984
So what are you gonna be, boy?

78
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,981
Policeman.

79
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,982
(choking)

80
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,864
Oh, that's nice, Bart.

81
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,241
You know, your father wanted
to be a policeman for a little while,

82
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,988
but they said
he was too heavy.

83
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,160
No, the Army said
I was too heavy.

84
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,619
The police said
I was too dumb.

85
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,078
Well, I'm going to be
a famous jazz musician.

86
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,579
I've got it all figured out:

87
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,451
I'll be unappreciated
in my own country,

88
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,457
but my gutsy blues stylings
will electrify the French.

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,080
I'll avoid the
horrors of drug abuse,

90
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,587
but I do plan to have
several torrid love affairs,

91
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,340
and I may or may not die young.

92
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,591
-I haven't decided.
-Honey, if that's what you want,

93
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,434
-we'll do anything we can to help.
-Wait a minute.

94
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,350
Isn't anybody going
to follow in my footsteps?

95
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,559
(crickets chirping)

96
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,144
(wolf howling)

97
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,066
Can you tell me
if I have what it takes

98
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,529
to be a blues musician?

99
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,029
Sure can.
Show me your chops.

100
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,452
(blues melody)

101
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,993
Uh-huh.

102
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,290
Yeah.

103
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,422
Cool.

104
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,165
So, you think
she has talent?

105
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,627
Sure.

106
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,007
Do you think she could be
a professional someday?

107
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,354
Oh, Lord, no.

108
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,889
But I'll practice every day.

109
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,642
Yeah, well, I'll be
frank with you, Lisa,

110
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,814
and when I say frank, I mean,
you know, devastating.

111
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,352
You've inherited
a finger condition

112
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,896
known as stubbiness.

113
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,609
It usually comes
from the father's side.

114
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,566
D'oh!

115
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,990
Stupid fingers.

116
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,028
You're wrong! You're wrong!

117
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,992
You don't need long fingers
to play the blues.

118
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,452
The blues come from in here.

119
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,544
My God, they are stubby.

120
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,833
(screams)

121
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,134
Look, I didn't steal
that copper wire.

122
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,708
I just thought
they were throwing it out.

123
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,133
Here. Take it.

124
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,801
Heh, no, no, sir.
We're here for your son.

125
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,470
He's coming
on a ride-along.

126
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,468
Good for you. Maybe this
will straighten the boy out.

127
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,514
Wow! Can I see your club?

128
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,306
It's called a baton,
son.

129
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,349
Oh. What's it for?

130
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,522
We club people with it.

131
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,190
Well! It's about time.

132
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,148
So you guys
like being cops?

133
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,821
Oh, it's great.

134
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,360
You get to run red lights,
park wherever you please,

135
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,244
hot-and-cold-running chicks.

136
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,201
And when you go home
at night,

137
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,741
you know you've made
a difference.

138
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,374
Hey Bart, you see
that Caddie over there?

139
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,741
BART:
Uh-huh.

140
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,577
That's Mayor Quimby's car.

141
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,422
Tonight, His Honor is
polling the electorate.

142
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,839
How would you like
a street named after you?

143
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,379
(whistling)

144
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,387
(scoffing)

145
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,548
I tell you.

146
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,426
They only come out at night.

147
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,103
<i>Dear log,</i>

148
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,971
<i>this will be my last entry,</i>

149
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,728
<i>for you were a journal</i>
<i>of my hopes and dreams,</i>

150
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,562
<i>and now, I have none.</i>

151
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,110
(cocks gun)

152
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,616
Do you need straight A's
to be a cop?

153
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,739
(hearty laughter)

154
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,408
Hey, fellas,
let's go shoot some bad guys.

155
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,667
Whoa, it doesn't quite
work that way, son.

156
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,839
People see movies like McBain,
and they think it's all

157
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,458
bang-bang, shoot-'em-up
cops and robbers.

158
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,457
(tires screeching)

159
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,468
Let's roll.

160
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,629
(siren wailing)

161
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,256
One-ocean-tango.

162
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,433
We're in pursuit
of a speeding individual

163
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,811
driving a red... car,
license number

164
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,179
eggplant-xerxes
crybaby-overbite-narwhal.

165
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,637
Oh, no.

166
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,727
Cops.

167
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,862
Whoo. They used
nylon rope this time.

168
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,243
It feels so smooth
against my skin--

169
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,280
almost sensuous.

170
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,034
(siren wailing)

171
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,208
Ooh, baby.

172

(screaming)

173
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,346
Damn boxes.

174
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,892
He's trapped.

175
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,859
-Where's our backup?
-I don't know.

176
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,493
Son, this is against
every regulation

177
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,240
but would you cover us?

178
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,202
BART:
Wow!

179
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,502
Huh?

180
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,339
(clicking)

181
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,796

182
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,511
See you in hell, punk.

183
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,354
{\an8}(screaming)

184
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,021
See you in hell, punk!

185
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,234
(screaming)

186
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,685
(glass breaking)

187
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,685
(moaning)

188
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,356
(sirens approaching)

189
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,985
Man, that was close.

190
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,952
Good thing this alley got
so narrow in the middle.

191
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,659
(tires squealing)

192
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,664
Well, that's nice work, boys.

193
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,916
Looks like
you just bought yourself

194
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,708
a lottery ticket,
to jail.

195
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,463
He's unconscious,
sir.

196
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,205
Oh, they can
still hear things.

197
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,666
Sir, I know

198
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,626
what I want to be
when I grow up-- a cop.

199
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,466
Well, until then, son

200
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,932
I'm gonna make you
an honorary police officer.

201
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,523
-Eddie, give him your badge.
-Hey!

202
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,849
Morning, honey.

203
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,477
What's so good
about being stuck

204
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,904
in the house
behind a stove?

205
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,402
Lisa, I know
you're down on homemaking

206
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,904
but it can really
let you be creative.

207
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,117
See? This morning I turned
bacon, eggs, and toast

208
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,618
into a nice smiley face
for Bart and Homer.

209
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,581
What's the point?
They'll never notice.

210
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,581
Oh, well,
you'd be surprised.

211
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,366
(chomping)

212
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,510
-Hmm, umm, hmm...
-(belches)

213
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:56,681
Now just relax your hand.
Thank you, ma'am.

214
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,642
You've been most cooperative.

215
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,522
(sniffing)

216
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,653
Bad dog!

217
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,649
(whines)

218
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,060
Very bad dog!

219
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,768
Mom, before
you blame the dog,

220
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,438
I think you should take a look
at these surveillance photos.

221
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,897
Oh.

222
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,447
Oh!

223
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,910
(groans)

224
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,200
Oh, Bart!

225
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,624
Oh. I don't know how
that got in there.

226
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,963
Lisa, why aren't you
at band practice?

227
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,580
I quit.

228
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,586
Honey, right now
you're discouraged

229
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,798
but deep down, you know
you love the saxophone.

230
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,469
I think you should stay
in the band.

231
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,508
If you think it's so great,
why don't you join the band?

232
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,513
Lisa... There are a lot
of people in the world

233
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,636
who like to tell you
what you can't do,

234
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,683
but they don't always know
what they're talking about.

235
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,015
You know what I want to be
when I grow up?

236
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,524
The girl
on the oatmeal box?

237
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,107
(laughing)

238
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,032
No. I'm going to be
an astronaut.

239
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,571
-Women can't be astronauts.
-Why not?

240
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,066
They distract
the men astronauts

241
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,867
so they wouldn't keep
their minds on the road.

242
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,370
There will too be
women astronauts.

243
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,043
(laughing)

244
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,041
It's true

245
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,542
and we'll all live

246
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,254
in cities on the Moon.

247
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,804
So, you see,
my sisters were wrong

248
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,709
except about
the cities on the Moon.

249
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,298
I was wrong about that, so...

250
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,854
Well, you can see
how anyone can be wrong.

251
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,639
(groans)

252
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,272
SKINNER:
Sleek, vigilant puma--

253
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,600
Principal of the mountains.

254
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,651
Hi, Lis.

255
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,570
Want to quiz me
on the vowels?

256
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,399
Janey, I'm about ready to chuck
the whole stinkin' alphabet.

257
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,355
Huh?

258
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,492
Lisa, what
are you doing?

259
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,575
That's
a bad-girl bathroom.

260
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,751
Duh!

261
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,422
You want to egg
Skinner's car?

262
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,880
Okay.

263
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,590
What are you
looking at?

264
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,590
Nothing.

265
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,211
Then get out.

266
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,917
'Cause we're figuring out
stuff to egg.

267
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,757
Okay, but if you really
want to honk Skinner off

268
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,104
I suggest you attack
the one thing

269
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,179
he truly believes in.

270
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,306
I saw some awful things
in 'Nam,

271
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,023
but you really have to wonder
at the mentality

272
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,524
that would desecrate
a helpless puma.

273
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,527
(scoffs)
I never thought I'd say this

274
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,319
but the no-goodniks
rule this school.

275
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,913
WILLIE:
Get your hands off me!

276
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,449
God, I could really use
a half day.

277
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,203
Think you're big men
with your handcuffs

278
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,196
and blasted Tasers!

279
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,997
Get him out of here.

280
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,250
I'll get you, Bart Simpson,
if it's the last thing I do!

281
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,003
Now what is this all about?

282
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,415
Well it's quite simple,
really.

283
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,803
I observed our friend,
Groundskeeper Willie,

284
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,801
burning leaves with
a blatant disregard

285
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,933
for our clean air laws.

286
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,589
Ha! Bart Simpson

287
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,887
on the side
of law and order?

288
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,390
Has the world gone topsy-turvy?

289
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,773
That's right, man.

290
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,849
I got my first taste
of authority

291
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,484
and I liked it.

292
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,981
Hmm.

293
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,862
Bart, there are a lot
of trouble makers

294
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,479
in this school,

295
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,856
and, Lord knows I can't
be everywhere at once.

296
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,573
Go on.

297
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,533
Look, let's can the euphemisms, huh?
No more bull spit.

298
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,945
How would you like to be
a hall monitor?

299
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,993
Wouldn't that mean
squealing on other kids?

300
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,616
That's the meat of it, yes.

301
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,003
Hmm...

302
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,964
{\an8}Now, Witness X

303
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,881
{\an8}would you please tell the court
what you saw?

304
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,710
{\an8}I'd be more than happy to.
(chuckles)

305
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,166
{\an8}I saw Mr. Montone there

306
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,295
seal the late
Mr. Palaccio in an oil drum

307
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,472
and roll him
off the pier.

308
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,721
I kill you!

309
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,103
Ay, caramba!

310
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,930
I don't know.

311
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,975
Oh, now...
you get to wear a sash.

312
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,189
(gasps)

313
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,018
You got yourself a narc.

314
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,024
Hey Jimbo, keeping your nose
clean, dude? Thatta boy.

315
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,897
Hey, Donna,
who loves you, baby?

316
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,855
(yelling)

317
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,446
Not in my hall, bub.

318
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,410
I think you've had enough,
sister.

319
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,453
Come on,
let's keep it moving.

320
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,037
Pink belly! Pink belly!
Pink belly!

321
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,502
All right, break it up, boys.

322
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,882
That belly ain't going
to get any pinker.

323
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,920
Okay.

324
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,462
-Wedgie!
-(grunts)

325
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,006
(boys laughing)

326
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,970
(painfully)
Thanks, Bart.

327
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,721
Bart's grades are up
a little this term,

328
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,636
but Lisa's are way down.

329
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,654
Oh, we always have one good kid
and one lousy kid.

330
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,858
Why can't both our kids
be good?

331
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,899
We have three kids,
Homer.

332
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,653
Marge, the dog
doesn't count as a kid.

333
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,356
No. Maggie.

334
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,656
Oh, yeah.

335
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,530
Now take some paste
and spread it

336
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,367
on the construction paper.

337
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,752
Ralph, are you eating
your paste?

338
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,290
(muffled:)
No, Miss Hoover.

339
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,963
Good. Now sprinkle
your sparkles on your paste.

340
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,883
Lisa, you're not sprinkling
your sparkles.

341
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,883
Shove it.

342
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,884
(gasps)

343
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,125
I have never seen

344
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,086
a good student
take such a slide.

345
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,346
Lisa, what are you
rebelling against?

346
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,970
What do you got?

347
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,942
...and she goes
"Lisa told Hoover to shove it."

348
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,863
And I'm, like,
"No way..."

349
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,361
And she's like "'Fraid so."
And I'm all "Whoa!"

350
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,363
And she's like--

351
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,534
Hey, Lisa, man.

352
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,452
I'm, like, so impressed.

353
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,990
When I was in second grade,
I was all "Hi there! I'm so good."

354
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,945
Want a smoke?

355
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,998
Uh... I'll smoke it in class.

356
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,671
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

357
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,880
Bart, you're doing
a bang-up job.

358
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,630
You know, before, there were
some corridors in this school

359
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,883
you'd just never go down.

360
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,344
Now I feel safe anywhere.

361
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,224
Every day
is a new fight, sir.

362
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,471
Bart, the school
is a police state.

363
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,103
Students are afraid
to sneeze.

364
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,220
I have you to thank.

365
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,017
Come with me.

366
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,600
<i>Madre de dios!</i>

367
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,056
The legends were true!

368
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,777
Yes, Bart, whenever a teacher
confiscates something

369
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,978
it ends up here.

370
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,528
Salacious halter tops,

371
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,951
complete collections
of <i>Mad, Cracked,</i>

372
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,530
and the occasional issue
of <i>Crazy,</i>

373
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,025
and this fake plastic derriere.

374
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,077
(laughing)

375
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,451
(grunts)

376
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,497
Now, to show my gratitude,
I want you

377
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,081
to help yourself
to an item of your choice.

378
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,252
All right!

379
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,797
Ooh, now you be careful
with that crossbow.

380
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,931
I will.

381
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,718
♪♪

382
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,939
Seymour.
This is an absence slip

383
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,769
signed by Nelson's mother,

384
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,654
and this is
Nelson's English homework.

385
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,991
Notice the identical
elongated loops on the D's.

386
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,698
Forgery!
So he didn't have leprosy.

387
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,158
This is a great day for me.
I thought I could never teach again.

388
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,656
Things have changed.

389
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,997
There will be no mockery
of your name, Mr. Glasscock.

390
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,597
Hey, Louis, watch this.

391
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,099
Ow! Bart, do something!

392
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,891
Let's go, Milhouse.

393
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,765
MILHOUSE: Sure, we have order--
but at what price?

394
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,727
Now let's correct
our homework exercises.

395
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,857
Lisa, what 19th century figure
was nicknamed Old Hickory?

396
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,116
I don't know. You?

397
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,528
(kids laughing)

398
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,656
Lisa, if you'd bothered
to do the assignment

399
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,075
you'd know the answer is...

400
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,504
The Battle of New Orleans...

401
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,883
I mean... Andrew Jackson.

402
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,010
Well, you're earning
your 18 grand a year.

403
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,218
(kids laughing)

404
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,889
(Lisa coughing)

405
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,088
Stupid Hoover.

406
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,098
Thinks she's so smart.

407
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,810
She wouldn't be so smart
without her teacher's edition.

408
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,954
(chuckling)

409
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,118
(distressed mumbling)

410
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,128
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

411
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,960
the unthinkable has happened.

412
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,045
Some sick, twisted individual
has stolen

413
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,261
every teacher's edition
in this school.

414
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,262
What do we do?

415
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,723
Declare a snow day!

416
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,513
Does anyone know
the multiplication table?

417
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,386
Please, please, don't panic.

418
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,603
They can smell fear.

419
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,813
Children, I know this is
highly irregular,

420
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,444
but for the rest of the day,
Martin will be teaching this class.

421
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,572
I will? But I wouldn't
know where to begin.

422
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,490
Just do it, brainiac.

423
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,818
Have I ever told you kids
about the '60s?

424
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,124
(kids clamoring)

425
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:41,409
I've got to get out of here.

426
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,075
Calm blue ocean,
calm blue ocean.

427
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,504
Calm blue ocean,
calm blue ocean.

428
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,213
I'm leaving the
profession again.

429
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,463
Oh, now Mr. Glasscock,
please reconsider.

430
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,086
Uh-uh.

431
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,092
(toilet flushing)

432
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,723
(whistling)

433
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,891
Bart, the police
haven't had any luck

434
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,930
finding the teacher's editions.

435
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:04,063
The dogs have picked up
the scent of books.

436
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,773
Send in
the battering ram.

437
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,693
Here we go.

438
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,022
We're going to have
to reorder every book.

439
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,738
Seymour,
I'll bet you a steak dinner

440
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,149
those books are still here.

441
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,027
All we have to do is
search every locker.

442
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,374
Bart, I'm not sure
random locker searches

443
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,028
are permitted
by the Supreme Court.

444
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,737
Pfft! Supreme Court.

445
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,077
What have they done
for us lately?

446
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,082
Let's move.

447
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,551
Hmm...

448
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,644
Baa!

449
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,895
(gasping)

450
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,166
(Bart gasps)

451
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,341
Lisa!

452
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,629
That's right.

453
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,382
It was I.

454
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,304
-Lis, why did you do it?
-Come on, Bart!

455
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,933
In your pre-fascist days,

456
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,680
you knew the giddy thrill
of futile rebellion.

457
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,603
Yeah, but even I had my limits.

458
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,431
You're looking
at expulsion for this.

459
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,187
I know! I know!

460
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,809
(sobbing)

461
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,027
(Skinner gasps)

462
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,398
The books!

463
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,275
Oh, answers! Answers!

464
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,334
Simpson, you've just saved
this school $120.

465
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,119
Who's behind
this monstrous crime?

466
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,124
-I am.
-(gasping)

467
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,998
SKINNER:
I've been so blind. In retrospect,

468
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,336
the signs all pointed
to a rogue hall monitor.

469
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,261
Sorry if I betrayed your
trust, Principal Sucker.

470
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,301
Now, Bart, in light of your
recent service to the school

471
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,296
I've decided to be lenient.

472
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,268
400 days detention.

473
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,388
400 days.

474
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,394
I can do that
standing on my head.

475
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,096
All right, 500 days.

476
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,476
Ooh! Big man!

477
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,982
600 days.

478
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,534
Maybe I'll just
shut my big mouth.

479
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,818
Let's go, Simpson.

480
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,362
Bart, why did you
take the blame?

481
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,236
'Cause I didn't want you
to wreck your life.

482
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,164
You got the brains and the
talent to go as far as you want.

483
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,954
And when you do,

484
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,157
I'll be right there
to borrow money.

485
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,538
Oh, Bart.

486
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,844
(saxophone playing)

487
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,050
Sounding good, Lis.
