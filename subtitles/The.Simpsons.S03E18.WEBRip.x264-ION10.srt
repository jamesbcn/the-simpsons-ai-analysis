Are you ready?

45
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,816

the lottery!

47
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,912

I know you're excited,

49
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,448
but calm down and listen
to me carefully.

50
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,077
Go get all your money...

51
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,424
I buy one lottery ticket a week

52
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,288
with the girls
at the hair salon.

53
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,705
We each play our birthday,

54
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,133
and that's enough
excitement for me.

55
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,882
You don't understand, Marge.

56
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,344
The lottery is the
one ray of hope

57
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,344
in my otherwise
unbearable life!

58
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,007
Uh, the lottery and you.

59
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,136
Homer, we're on a
tight budget, here.

60
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,433
Promise me you won't
get carried away.

61
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,057
Yes, money-- I mean honey.

62
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,024
Ooh! Here comes the news
report about the lottery.

63
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,565
Hey, down in front.

64
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,609
<i>The whole state is suddenly</i>
<i>in the grip of lottery fever</i>

65
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,244
<i>and Springfield is</i>
<i>no exception.</i>

66
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,782
<i>In fact, every copy</i>
<i>of Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery"</i>

67
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,327
<i>has been checked out</i>
<i>from the Springfield Public Library.</i>

68
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,501
<i>Of course, the book does</i>
<i>not contain any hints</i>

69
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,329
<i>on how to win the lottery.</i>

70
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,674
<i>It is rather a chilling tale</i>
<i>of conformity gone mad.</i>

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,590
Ohh....

72
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,755
<i>But there's already</i>
<i>one big winner--</i>

73
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,798
<i>our state school system</i>

74
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,262
<i>which gets fully half the profits</i>
<i>from the lottery.</i>

75
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,092
Just think what we can buy
with that money:

76
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,637
History books that know how
the Korean War came out.

77
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,681
Math books that don't have
that Base-6 crap in them.

78
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,726
And a state-of-the-art
detention hall

79
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,399
where children are held
in place with magnets.

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,150
Magnets,
always with the magnets.

81
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:03,331
HOMER: I've never been
so sure of anything in my life.

82
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,749
I am going to win this lottery.

83
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:09,078
Homer, the odds
are 380 million to one.

84
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:13,085
Correction:
380 million to 50!

85
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,839
So, what are you gonna do
with your share of the money, kids?

86
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,922
Put it in the bank.

87
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,336
Give it to the poor.

88
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,594
Pfft. What do kids know
about spending money?

89
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,887
What are you
gonna do, Homer?

90
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,260
Hmm...

91
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,232
Hey Homer, what did you do,
get a haircut or something?

92
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,769
(booming voice)
Look closer, Lenny.

93
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,233
Oh, I know what it is.

94
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,903
You're the biggest man
in the world now

95
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,572
and you're covered
in gold.

96
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,690
14-karat gold.

97
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,737
Take a hike, boss.

98
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,861
I'm running things now.

99
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,658
All hail King Homer.

104
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,545
-(phone rings)
-They're about to start, Chief.

105
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,467
No, you got
the wrong number.

106
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,426
This is 91... 2.

107
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,101
We'll be with you
in a minute, kids.

108
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,016
This could be our ticket
out of here, Mel.

109
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,686
<i>I will now draw</i>
<i>the first winning number.</i>

110
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,185
(groaning)

111
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:23,157
I've got so many tickets
I can't lose.

112
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,329
<i>The first number is 17.</i>

113
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,488
D'oh!

114
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,536
You can still
win some money

115
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,618
if you have
five out of six.

116
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,123
Woo-hoo!

117
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,504
<i>And the second number</i>
<i>is... three.</i>

118
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,462
D'oh!

119
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,672
Yeah, I knew
we wouldn't win.

120
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,633
Well, why didn't you
tell the rest of us?

121
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,674
Why did you
keep it a secret!?

122
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,298
If you were 17,
we'd be rich.

123
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:48,505
But no,
you had to be ten.

124
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,018
<i>And the final number</i>
<i>is... 49.</i>

125
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,901
<i>38... 49!</i>

126
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,649

Oh, well,
we lost the money

139
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,347
but at least we've
still got each other.

140
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,139
Hey, the dog's dead.

141
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,973
(gasping)

142
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,150
BART: Grampa, he's not dead.

143
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,363
HOMER: Dad, you shouldn't say
the dog's dead when he's not.

144
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,573
It's not fair to toy with
people's emotions like that.

145
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,025
He is dead.
I'll get a shovel.

146
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,196
Well, he's not dead,
but he is awfully sick.

147
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,115
Oh, sure, the old man's
off his rocker.

148
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,205
If Grampa says he's dead,
he must be alive.

149
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,212
He is alive.

150
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,383
He's wagging his tail.

151
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,762
That don't mean nothin'!

152
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,509
Dogs wag their tails
for hours after they die.

153
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,220
I'm tired
of this conversation.

154
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,140
Let's talk
about something else.

155
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,219
I'm going home.

156
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,273
Clear.

157
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,020
Clear.

158
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,645
{\an8}Doctor, he's gone.

159
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,861
Ugh! This is the part
of the job I hate.

160
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,954
Hey, you did the best
you could.

161
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,740
I love animals.

162
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,124
I spend my life saving them,
and they can't thank me.

163
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,042
Well, the parrots can,
but anyway,

164
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,121
let's see what's wrong
with this little fellow.

165
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,212
(dog whimpering)

166
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,673
Hmm...

167
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,382
I'm afraid that your dog
has a twisted stomach.

168
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,974
He needs an operation
to correct it

169
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,139
-or he'll die.
<i>-♪♪ (dramatic)</i>

170
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,968
How much will it cost?

171
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,973
$750.

172
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,885
Oh, dear.

173
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,564
This is never an easy decision.
It's an awful lot of money.

174
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,443
Well, I guess
we'll have to talk it over.

175
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,571
Talk what over?
What's there to talk about?

176
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,778
What are we gonna talk over?

177
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,609
Mr. Teeny needs a refill
of his nicotine gum.

178
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,155
I can't help but notice
we're leaving the hospital.

179
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,619
When's the dog going
to get his operation?

180
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,120
Uh... later.
First I want to tell you

181
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,213
about the most
wonderful place

182
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,368
in the world--

183
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,286
Doggie Heaven.

184
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,674
In Doggie Heaven,
there's mountains of bones

185
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,093
and you can't turn around

186
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,131
without sniffing
another dog's butt.

187
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,005
And all the best dogs
are there--

188
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,391
Old Yeller and about
eight Lassies, and--

189
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,760
Is there a doggie hell?

190
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,516
Well, of course,
there couldn't be

191
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,058
a heaven if there
weren't a hell.

192
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,481
-Who's in there?
-Oh... Hitler's dog,

193
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,811
and that dog Nixon had,
what's his name? Chester?

194
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,477
Checkers.

195
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,145
Yeah, and one of the Lassies
is in there too.

196
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,145
The mean one--
the one that mauled Timmy.

197
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,858
Hey, wait a minute,

198
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,408
does this have anything to do
with Santa's Little Helper?

199
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,701
Oh, honey,
$750 is a lot of money.

200
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,866
We really can't afford
this operation.

201
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,496
You're gonna just let him die?

202
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,962
I know you're upset.

203
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,542
Darn right I'm upset!

204
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,247
Bart, watch your language.

205
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,707
Oh... you did. Sorry.

206
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,838
We're not going to let
our dog die, and that's it!

207
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,506
Lousy, dog-killing
son-of-a--

208
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,385
(sighing)

209
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,602
Well, it will be okay.

210
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,853
We'll get him
a new dog--

211
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,144
one with
an untwistable stomach.

212
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,398
(whimpering)

213
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,611
Oh, come on.

214
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,572
I'm sorry but we just
can't afford it.

215
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,824
Marge, make him stop.

216
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,316
Oh!

217
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,538
All right, all right,
we'll find a way.

218
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,788
Lousy, manipulative dog.

219
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,750
Uh, Mr. Burns
I need to borrow some money.

220
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,672
Please, do go on.

221
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,300
HOMER: I know you're
a good man

222
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,338
and I have a dog
that's very sick.

223
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,433
Oh, please, continue.

224
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,588
I thought maybe you...

225
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,507
Oh.

226
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,966
Well, thanks
for your time.

227
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,596
What makes a man
endanger his job

228
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,564
and, yes, even his life
by asking me for money?

229
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,396
People like dogs,
Mr. Burns.

230
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,691
Nonsense. Dogs are idiots.

231
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,565
Think about it, Smithers,
If I came into your house

232
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,203
and started sniffing
at your crotch

233
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,870
and slobbering
all over your face

234
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,988
what would you say?

235
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,994
If you did it, sir?

236
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,906
Exactly. You'd be fit
to be tied. Dogs!

237
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,617
Hmm...

238
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,167
-No!
-What?

239
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,840
You are not going to perform
that operation yourself.

240
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,419
But Marge, it looks so easy.

241
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,014
Just like carving a turkey.

242
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,974
ALL: Oh! Oh!

243
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,181
Eww!

244
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,061
(grunting)

245
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,888
Maybe you're right, Marge.

246
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,981
I found a way we can pay
for the operation.

247
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,274
-BOTH: All right!
-Hear that, boy?

248
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,778
-What do you got, Marge, insurance scam?
-No.

249
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,110
I'm afraid we're
just going

250
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,405
to have to make
a few sacrifices.

251
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,699
Homer, you're going to have
to give up beer for a while.

252
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,195
Bart, from now on,

253
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,906
you'll have to get
your hair cut for free

254
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,616
at Springfield
Barber College.

255
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,376
No <i>problemo.</i>

256
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,918
I'm going to give up buying
my weekly lottery ticket

257
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,712
and I found a way to stretch
the food budget.

258
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,087
Fried chicken night will now
be organ meat night.

259
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,264
Ham night will be Spam night,
and pork chop night--

260
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,184
-(sobbing)
-Will be chub night.

261
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,852
Chub? I don't even know
what that is.

262
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,272
Lisa, I'm afraid
we'll have to stop getting you

263
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,691
those volumes of
Encyclopedia Generica

264
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,229
from the grocery store.

265
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,023
But Mom, next week is
volume four--

266
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,107
Copernicus
through Elephantiasis.

267
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,652
We all have
to make sacrifices, dear.

268
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,776
Maggie's baby clothes will have
to last for a little longer.

269
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,115
Marge, I've figured out

270
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,040
an alternative
to giving up my beer.

271
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,420
Basically, we become a family
of traveling acrobats.

272
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,791
I don't think
you've thought this through.

273
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,298
-(gasping)
-Good news, Mr. Danielson.

274
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,143
We saved your gamecock,

275
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,968
but I'm afraid
he'll never fight again.

276
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,354
That's what you think.

277
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,811
He'll fight and he'll win.

278
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:09,943
Clamp.

279
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,270
(beeping)

280
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,106
Wipe.

281
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,901
(flat tone)

282
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:16,985
No!

283
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,199
No!

284
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,699
MAN'S VOICE:
Come to the light, boy.

285
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,742
Come into the light.

286
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,036
Come on now.

287
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,949
There's a good boy.

288
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,327
Come on. Come on.

289
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,430
(rhythmic breathing)

290
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,508
(monitor beeping)

291
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,893
-Um, Simpson?
-(gasping)

292
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,932
(barking)

293
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,984
Oh, Santa's Little Helper,
you're alive!

294
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,438
Oh, you're all better now!

295
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,688
It's times like this
I'm glad

296
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,900
I flunked out
of dental school.

297
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,106
{\an8}HOMER:
Lousy chub night.

298
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,114
{\an8}Hey, how come he gets
meat and we don't?

299
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,566
You wouldn't want
what he's eating.

300
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,025
It's mostly just
snouts and entrails.

301
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,406
Mmm... snouts.

302
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,865
<i>Yes, I'm back.</i>

303
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,414
<i>Kent Brockman</i>
<i>is not the kind of man</i>

304

<i>Hey, I'm a journalist.</i>

307
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,762
Well, he's got all the money

308
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,179
but there's one thing
he can't buy.

309
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,848
-What's that?
-A dinosaur.

If it wasn't for that dog,
I would have won.

325
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,631
Class, for tomorrow, I want
you to write a report

326
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,803
on Copernicus.

327
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,132
D'oh!

328
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,927
MAN:
Come on, booze hound.

329
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,350
You want the 25 cents,
don't you?

330
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,258
Keep singing!

Who's that old rummy?

335
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,646
Before his dog got sick

336
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,441
that old rummy used
to be my best customer.

00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,292
Okay, I'll just even
this out and--

343
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,830

344

a third-rate biography

350

at the bus station?

351
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,888
Dumb dog.

352
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:52,854

353
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,274
Homie, did you
close the gate?

354
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,317
Yes.

355
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,480

356
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,744
Oh, you mean tonight.

357
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:08,993
The dog will get out.

358
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,834
Bart, close the gate!

359
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,291
Oh, Lisa, close the gate!

360
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,332

366
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,527
it's all my fault.

367

I called him a dumb dog.

368
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,946
Oh, he's gone and he's never
coming back.

369

Wait! There he is!

370

377

Not one that
I want the public to see.

I can't wait to start pawing
through my garbage

386
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,612
like some
starving raccoon.

387
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,815
Release the hounds.

388
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,235
Well, neighbor
I see you've got

389
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,243
your running shoes on.
That's a good thing.

What's wrong
with Crippler?

394
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,014
He's getting on, sir.

395
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,128
He's been here
since the late '60s.

396
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,085
Ah, yes,
I'll never forget the day

397
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,926
he bagged his first hippie.

398
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,561
That young man didn't think
it was too groovy.

399
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,468

I'm looking for something
in an attack dog--

401
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,191
one who likes the sweet,
gamey tang of human flesh.

402
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,733
Why, here's the fellow.

403
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,817
Wiry, fast, firm,
proud buttocks.

404
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,815
Reminds me of me.

405
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,116
Ah, the last one.

406
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,047
D'oh!

407
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,799
Now, as an attack dog

408
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,051
you'll be expected
to neutralize intruders.

I'd have been bothered
by now.

414
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,273
I know how you feel.

415
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,562
I lost my dog too.

416
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,266
He's in here somewhere.

we'll never see him again.
