1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:06,589
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:32,949
Hello. I'm Kent Brockman,
and this is Eye on Springfield.

3
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,905
Tonight, we'll visit
Springfield's answer

4
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,699
to the Benedictine monks...
the Rapping Rabbis.

5
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,451
Don't eat pork.

6
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,869
Not even vit' a fork.

7
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,454
Can't touch this!

8
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,081
Marge, are we Jewish?

9
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,999
- No, Homer.
- Whoo-hoo!

10
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,214
- But first, we all stink.
- We all... hey!

11
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,965
That's according
to a national survey

12
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,219
ranking Springfield as the
least popular city in America.

13
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,012
In science, dead last.

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,847
I'm telling you people

15
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,433
the Earth revolves
around the sun.

16
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,268
Burn him!

17
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,979
What a story!

18
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,232
You've stolen my soul!

19
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,317
In culture, dead last.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,778
Eleanor, we've got
to do something

21
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,363
about this depression,

22
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,031
so I propo...

23
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,575
Oh! That's right,
I'm crippled.

24
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,119
This is terrible.

25
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,995
People will start
to avoid Springfield.

26
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,413
But what can I do?

27
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,582
I'm just... one... one man.

28
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,960
I think we should call
a town meeting.

29
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,587
If we don't do something soon,
we won't get any tourists at all.

30
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,839
No tourists?

31
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,549
I'll be ruined.

32
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,969
Maps to movie stars' homes!

33
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,180
Mapas por las casas
de la cineastas.

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,225
Top-u stah noh cheezu map-u.

35
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,729
Excuse me.
Are you Drew Barrymore?

36
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,983
What? Get out of here.
I'm hung over.

37
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,152
- Sorry, Miss Barrymore.
- What?

38
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,987
Are there

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,031
any suggestions for how
to attract more tourism?

40
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,410
The easiest way to be popular

41
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,996
is to leech off
the popularity of others.

42
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,455
So we propose changing

43
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,207
our name from "Springfield"

44
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,834
to "Seinfeld."

45
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,006
I may be just a boy,
but I have an idea.

46
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,383
If I may, I'd like
to show you a few slides.

47
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,510
Here's Springfield
as it appears from space.

48
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,598
Somewhere in this windy valley
is the Lost Dutchman's Mine.

49
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,391
Young man, that appears
to be a picture

50
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,475
of your rear end.

51
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,977
So long, suckers!

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,521
Whoa!

53
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,190
Aw! This is the last time

54
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,817
I use an escape plan
devised by Milhouse.

55
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,360
Uh, sorry, Bart.

56
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,405
I'm Marge Simpson,
and I have an idea.

57
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,950
Marge is going
to say something.

58
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,412
Now I know you haven't liked
some of my past suggestions

59
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,123
like switching
to the metric system...

60
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,126
The metric system
is the tool of the devil!

61
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,171
My car gets 40 rods
to the hogshead,

62
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,382
and that's the way I likes it.

63
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,760
The old person's remarks will be
stricken from the record.

64
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,053
Who said that?

65
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,138
But my new idea is different.

66
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,349
I think we should hold
a film festival

67
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,142
and give out prizes.

68
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,186
Could we make our own movies
and enter them?

69
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,814
- Yes.
- At last, an excuse to wear makeup!

70
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,901
All in favor of Marge Simpson's
film festival idea...

71
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,444
Film festival!

72
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,612
Film festival!

73
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,821
You like my idea?

74
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,241
Actually,
I have several others...

75
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,076
Don't push your luck!

76
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,744
Don't push your luck!

77
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,081
And... action!

78
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,166
Hello. I'm Bart Simpson.

79
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,627
In the past, I've brought you
such classic films

80
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,630
as Homer in the Shower
and Homer on the Toilet.

81
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:19,008
And now I give you
The Eternal Struggle.

82
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,804
"Relaxed fit," my Aunt Fanny.

83
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,972
Stupid Dockers.

84
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,600
Oh, the belt is buckled.

85
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,940
Now Maude, in our movie,
you lay baby Moses in the basket

86
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,942
then put it among the reeds.

87
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,152
Okay? Lights! Camera!

88
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,822
A-diddily-doddily-
doodilly-action, Jackson!

89
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:51,833
Help me-e-e-e-e-e!

90
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,419
Flanders to God,
Flanders to God.

91
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,754
Get off your cloud
and save my Todd!

92
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,637
Yay!

93
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,139
Thanks, God.

94
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,390
Okely-dokely.

95
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,392
What are you doing, Ma?

96
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,620
I'm looking for a film critic
to help judge our festival.

97
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,647
Did you know there are over
600 critics on TV,

98
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,733
and Leonard Maltin's
the best-looking of them all?

99
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,652
Welcome to Coming Attractions.

100
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,571
I'm your host, Jay Sherman.

101
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,655
Thank you.

102
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,532
Tonight, we review

103
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,618
an aging Charles Bronson
in Death Wish Nine.

104
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,663
I wish I was dead. Oy!

105
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,498
But first,
we have a special guest.

106
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,167
Rainer Wolfcastle...

107
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,754
Star of the reprehensible
McBain movies.

108
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,213
Jay, my new film

109
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,632
is a mix
of action und comedy.

110
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,802
It's called
McBain: Let's Get Silly.

111
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,679
Did you ever notice

112
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,640
how men always leave
the toilet seat up?

113
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,975
That's the joke.

114
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,394
You suck, McBain!

115
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,733
And now,
my Woody Allen impression.

116
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,610
"I'm a neurotic nerd

117
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,612
who likes to sleep
with little girls."

118
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,947
Hey, that really sucked!

119
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,162
The film is just me
in front of a brick wall

120
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,789
for an hour and a half.

121
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,375
It cost $80 million.

122
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,293
How do you sleep at night?

123
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,003
On top of a pile of money

124
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,838
with many beautiful ladies.

125
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,299
Just asking. Eesh!

126
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,344
I like him.
He's smart, he's sensitive,

127
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,530
he's clearly not obsessed
with his physical appearance.

128
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,431
My ears are burning.

129
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,934
Uh, I wasn't talking
about you, Dad.

130
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,352
Well, my ears
are really burning.

131
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,813
I wanted to see inside,
so I lit a Q-tip.

132
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,941
Dear Mr. Sherman,

133
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,859
on behalf of the people
of Springfield,

134
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,362
I would like to invite you
to judge our film festival.

135
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,406
You can stay with us

136
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,991
and enjoy the sights and sounds
of the country.

137
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,785
Marge, is this
a pimple or a boil?

138
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,495
Just a minute, Homer.

139
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,039
Oh! Look what
you made me write.

140
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,351
Anyway, we think you'll really
enjoy our quiet little town.

141
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,085
Sincerely, Marge Simpson.

142
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,630
Hmm... do I really
want to leave Manhattan?

143
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,925
Sherman, I just realized,
you insulted me.

144
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,468
Now you will die.

145
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,430
Uh, hey, Nudnick,
your shoe's untied.

146
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,515
From here,
they appear to be tied,

147
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,684
but I will go in
for a closer look.

148
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,103
Taxi!

149
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,563
To the airport!

150
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,027
On closer inspection,
these are loafers.

151
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,369
Attention. The flight
from New York has arrived.

152
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,787
Hey, I'm landing here!

153
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,502
It's supposed to say
Jay's name, not yours.

154
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,254
Oh, you're right.

155
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,925
There you...

156
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,219
Just a second.

157
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,014
- That's it... D'oh!
- Hello.

158
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,600
I'm Marge Simpson,
and this is my husband, Homer.

159
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,185
Oh, nice to meet you, Marge.

160
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,061
I saw your hair
from the plane.

161
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,481
And you must be
the man who didn't know

162
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,316
if he had a pimple or a boil.

163
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,776
It was a Gummi Bear.

164
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,988
Coming up next... The Flintstones
Meet The Jetsons.

165
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,450
Uh-oh. I smell another
cheap cartoon crossover.

166
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,161
Bart Simpson, meet
Jay Sherman, the critic.

167
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,287
Hello.

168
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,747
Hey, man,
I really love your show.

169
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,790
I think all kids
should watch it.

170
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,460
Ew... I suddenly feel so dirty.

171
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,717
I don't know
what's happening.

172
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,220
It seems our profits
have dropped 37%.

173
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,263
I'm afraid we have
a bad image, sir.

174
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,742
Market research shows people
see you as something of an ogre.

175
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,352
I ought to club them
and eat their bones.

176
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,896
Heh-heh. Well, maybe this
film festival could help us.

177
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,607
A film biography might let them
get to know the real you...

178
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,610
Virtuous, heroic, nubile...

179
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,570
You left out pleasant!

180
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,948
But I like
that film biography idea...

181
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,450
A slick Hollywood picture
to gloss over

182
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,037
my evil rise to power
like Bugsy or Working Girl.

183
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,123
- Get me Steven Spielberg.
- He's unavailable.

184
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,418
Then get me his non-union
Mexican equivalent.

185
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,463
Listen Señor Spielbergo,
I want you to do for me

186
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,549
what Spielberg did
for Oskar Schindler.

187
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,883
Schindler es bueno.

188
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,135
Señor Burns es el diablo.

189
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,430
Listen Spielbergo, Schindler
and I are like peas in a pod.

190
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,015
We're both factory owners.

191
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,017
We both made shells
for the Nazis,

192
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,852
but mine worked, damn it.

193
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,980
Now go out there
and win me that festival.

194
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,152
Homer, the guest should get
the last pork chop.

195
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,488
But I'm still hungry.

196
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,375
Mr. Sherman,

197
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,669
I understand you have
two Pulitzer Prizes.

198
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,964
Well, it's not like
I carry them around with me.

199
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,633
Ooh, it's so hot in here.

200
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,344
Oh, look, here's
my People's Choice award.

201
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,096
Five Golden Globes.

202
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,684
Where's my Emmy?

203
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,562
Thank you.

204
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,022
Yeah, well, I won

205
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,065
the belching contest at work.

206
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,613
Very nice, Homer.

207
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,290
Wow, how many
Pulitzer Prize winners

208
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,625
can do that?

209
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,668
Just me and Eudora Welty.

210
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,463
Oh, I invited my sisters over.

211
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,714
Ooh, sisters.

212
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,215
Allow me.

213
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,680
So then I said to Woody Allen,

214
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,310
"Well, Camus can do,
but Sartre is smartre."

215
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,478
So original.

216
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,438
How droll.

217
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,400
Yeah, well,
"Scooby-doo can doo-doo,

218
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,654
but Jimmy Carter is smarter."

219
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,119
Okay, Sherman,
you're a movie expert.

220
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,871
So tell us, who's gay?

221
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,081
Oh, I don't know.

222
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,374
Harvey Fierstein.

223
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,376
- No!
- Who else?

224
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,505
Oh, MacGyver's gay.

225
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,347
You badmouthed MacGyver,
didn't you?

226
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,811
What you doing, Marge?

227
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,979
Making out the jury list
for the film festival.

228
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,357
Mayor Quimby, Krusty, Jay...

229
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,236
Marge, do you respect
my intelligence?

230
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,781
Yes.

231
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,909
Okay. Wait a minute.

232
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,744
Why did it take you
so long to say yes?

233
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,498
No reason.

234
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,916
Okay.

235
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,459
Wait a minute.

236
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,002
Are you humoring me?

237
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,631
Yes.

238
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,924
Okay.

239
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,759
Wait a minute.
That's bad.

240
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,846
Look, I know I'm not witty
like that critic guy,

241
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,599
but does he know all the words
to the Oscar Mayer song?

242
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,603
Oh, I wish I were
an Oscar Mayer wiener.

243
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,441
That is what
I'd truly like to be.

244
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,278
'Cause if I were
an Oscar Mayer wiener.

245
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:22,616
Everyone would be
in love with me...

246
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,498
That's it, Marge.

247
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,625
He knows
the whole hot dog song.

248
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,669
Go ahead. Sleep with him.

249
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,921
I'll just take
a lock of your hair

250
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,007
to remember you by.

251
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,134
It's just you and me now,
lock of hair.

252
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,927
You don't have
to do this.

253
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,554
Yeah? Well you think
I'm stupid.

254
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,681
I don't think
you're stupid.

255
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,659
Prove it... put me on that
film jury festival thing.

256
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,810
Fine, you're on the jury.

257
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,194
Sir, the actors are here
to audition

258
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,737
for the part of you.

259
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,821
Excellent.

260
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,367
Excellent.

261
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,621
- Next.
- Exc-ell-ent.

262
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:13,167
- Next.
- Exactly... D'oh!

263
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,669
- Next.
- Excellente.

264
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,004
Es muy bueno.

265
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,130
Oh, it's hopeless.

266
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,924
I'll have to play myself.

267
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,762
Oh, I thought they were playing

268
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,764
the Rocky Horror Picture Show
tonight.

269
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,851
Our first film
is by Indian director.

270
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,394
Apu Nahassapemapetilan.

271
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,105
Bright Lights, Beef Jerky.

272
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,650
Help! Help! Police!

273
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,693
I got problems
of my own right now.

274
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,488
Oh, boy. This is going to get worse
before it gets better.

275
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,203
Next, we have Moe the Bartender
in Moe Better Booze.

276
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,455
Money gets you.

277
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,374
One more round,
drink it down.

278
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,625
You stupid clown.

279
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,669
Money gets you
one more round.

280
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,963
Then you're out on your ass.

281
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,214
Whoa!

282
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,674
Ah, my back!

283
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,357
This contest is over.

284
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,235
Give that man the $10,000.

285
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,154
This isn't
America's Funniest Home Videos.

286
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,824
But the ball... his groin.

287
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:31,412
It works on so many levels.

288
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,038
Roll it again.

289
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,249
Next, they're going
to show my movie.

290
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,959
You made a movie?

291
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,961
I made a movie?

292
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,422
No wonder I was on the cover
of Entertainment Weekly.

293
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,763
My name is Barney Gumble.

294
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,265
I'm 40...

295
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,348
I am single...

296
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,391
and I drink.

297
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,986
There's a line in Othello
about a drinker.

298
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,488
"Now a sensible man

299
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,990
"by and by a fool

300
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,366
and presently a beast!"

301
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,368
That pretty well covers it.

302
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,583
It's brilliant.

303
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,293
Savagely honest, tender...

304
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,086
he has the soul of a poet.

305
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,671
You're very kind.

306
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,382
Excuse me. Did something
crawl down your throat and die?

307
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,884
It didn't die.

308
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,595
My name is Barney,
and I'm an alcoholic.

309
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,139
Mr. Gumble,
this is a Girl Scout meeting.

310
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,268
Is it, or is it that you girls
can't admit you have a problem?

311
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,651
Don't cry for me.

312
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,611
I'm already dead.

313
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,125
I think we have
a winner.

314
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,293
What'd I miss?

315
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,045
Homer! Please pay
attention.

316
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,672
There's just
one more movie.

317
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,186
Simple villagers,
I promise you.

318
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,523
I will close plants in America
and bring work here.

319
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,108
Viva, Señor Burns.

320
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,527
Viva! Viva!

321
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,655
Whoa!!

322
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,536
We did 20 takes,
and that was the best one.

323
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,162
Remember, Elliott.

324
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,914
I'll be right here.

325
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,928
- Pure egotism.
- Self-indulgent tripe.

326
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,388
I don't care
what they say.

327
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,515
I'm going to win
this festival.

328
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,695
Drink up, Judah Ben-hur.

329
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,701
You truly are the king of kings.

330
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,412
Excellent.

331
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,293
Smithers,
are they booing me?

332
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:28,839
Uh, no, they're saying,
"buu-urns, buu-urns."

333
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,508
Are you saying
"boo" or "buu-urns?"

334
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,346
I was saying, "buu-urns."

335
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,521
Alright it's time
to vote for the grand prize.

336
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,440
I vote for Barney Gumble's

337
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:50,277
sensitive, yet unfortunately
titled film Puke-a-hantas.

338
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,821
- Second.
- Well I vote for Burns's movie.

339
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,823
Me, too.
Now let's get going.

340
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,784
I got a date
with Eudora Welty.

341
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,828
Coming, Eudora.

342
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,999
Excellent.

343
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,960
Bribing those two judges
has paid off

344
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,797
just as it did during
the Miss Teen America pageant.

345
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,007
How can you vote
for Burns's movie?

346
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,842
Let's just say
it moved me...

347
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,594
to a bigger house!

348
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,972
Oops! I said the quiet part loud
and the loud part quiet.

349
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,099
Oh, dear.

350
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,475
Two to two.

351
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,227
Well, Homer,
it all comes down to you.

352
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,228
Football in the groin!

353
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,105
Football in the groin!

354
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,732
Well, we're not going to resolve
this deadlock any time soon.

355
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,193
Why don't we all take
a five-minute break?

356
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,444
It'll clear our heads.

357
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,654
Good idea, Marge.

358
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,406
My mind is going
a mile a minute.

359
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,662
I knew this
would happen.

360
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,996
I put you on the jury

361
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,040
and you vote
for the stupidest film.

362
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,042
I have every right
to be on that jury

363
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,585
even though I got there

364
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,587
by sleeping with
the head of the festival.

365
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,923
How many times have
I heard Rex Reed say that?

366
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,008
Aw great, now you're going
to make fun of me.

367
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,927
No, Homer, I won't make fun,

368
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,763
but I will suggest that there
may be better things in life

369
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,225
than seeing a man get hit
in the groin with a football.

370
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,271
- Well, Homer?
- Marge...

371
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,481
I've got some
serious thinking to do.

372
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,112
Hmm... Barney's movie
had heart,

373
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,740
but football in the groin
had a football in the groin.

374
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,826
Don't cry for me.

375
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,536
I'm already dead.

376
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,080
Wow. I'll never drink
another beer.

377
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
- Beer here!
- I'll take ten.

378
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,877
And now to announce
the winners.

379
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,046
The award for Outstanding
Animated Short goes to:

380
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,299
Itchy and Scratchy
for their film.

381
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,552
Four Funerals and a Wedding.

382
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,373
And now, the winner
of the grand prize.

383
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,544
Barney Gumble.

384
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,843
Homie, you voted
for the right movie.

385
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,305
I'm glad you
were on the jury.

386
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,849
Aw... you know
something, Marge?

387
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,061
It's not that tough
being a film cricket.

388
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,855
I've learned I have a gift
to share with the world.

389
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,983
From now on, there'll be
a new Barnard Gumble...

390
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,819
Hard-working, clean and sober.

391
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,531
Congratulations, Barney,
and enjoy your grand prize...

392
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,284
A lifetime supply
of Duff beer.

393
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,745
Just hook it to my veins!

394
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,916
Good-bye, Mr. Sherman.

395
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,119
If I ever play
Carnegie Hall,

396
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,543
I'll give you a call.

397
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,671
And if you ever want
to visit my show...

398
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,422
Nah, we're not going
to be doing that.

399
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,883
Well, Jay, I hope you tell
your New York friends

400
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,803
that people in small towns
arent quite as dumb as they think.

401
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,054
Marge, look.

402
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,681
This has spring snakes inside,

403
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,433
but the suckers will
think it's beer nuts.

404
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,435
Mmm, beer nuts.

405
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,689
Well, it was a lovely festival.

406
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,066
The best movie won,
and Mr. Burns found

407
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,610
there are some awards
that can't be bought.

408
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,196
And the Oscar goes to...

409
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,990
I've got to win this one.

410
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,992
I bribed everyone in Hollywood.

411
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,453
George C. Scott in
Man Getting Hit by Football.

412
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,378
Arr! My groin!

413
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,397
