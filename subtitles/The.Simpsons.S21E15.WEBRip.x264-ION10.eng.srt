{\an8}Oh, meters?

27
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,015
{\an8}Dad, a meter is three inches
longer than a yard,

28
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:42,852
{\an8}which is 36 inches,

29

Apparently, the
people she hired

55

to deprogram her
sister from that cult

56
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,141

take her place?

takes her shoes off.

{\an8}My parents took me
to Hawaii once,

78

Can I teeter

144
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,790
Ever since you got
that bad grade,

145
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,411
you seem a lot cooler.

146
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,748
Lisa, you want
to come skip rope?

147
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,793
You can replace the tree.

148
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,876
Eat lunch with me.

149
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,050
Share my locker.

150
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,758
Come to my
birthday party.

to you for a moment?

154
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Uh-oh.

155
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,814

162
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,991
I cheated wrong.

163
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,199

Dad?

172
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,093
-Hey, boy.
-(screams)

173
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,257

Dad, that is genius,
but I need some advice.

00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,766
Homer?

177
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,811

I was just like Lisa Simpson.

360
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,286
(gasps)

361
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,751
That's right, Lisa.

362
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,130
As an avid organic gardener,
I've read your blog.

363
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:05,259
Flotus1 is First Lady
of The United States one!

364
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,009
Yes. I wanted just "Flotus,"
but someone had it.

365
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,142
That's me, 'cause I swim
with my flotuses on.

366
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,220
Everything I have
I got through academics.

367
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,226
I went to Chicago's
first magnet high school,

368
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,979
then Princeton,
then Harvard Law.

369
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,692
And now you're the most elegant
and popular woman in the world!

370
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,944
Well...

371
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,525
(laughing) I don't
know about that.

372
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,820
There's Carla Bruni,
Queen Noor of Jordan...

373
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,204
They're nothing compared to you.

374
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,741
It's not a contest.

375
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,325
But if it were, I think
we know how it would go.

376
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,461
But before I was who I am today,
I was a nerd.

377
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,170
So the lesson is, children...

378
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,880
I'll tell them
what the lesson is.

379
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,090
He's our Joe Biden.

380
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,709
Understood. So kids,

381
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,876
be nice to Lisa,
because the overachievers

382
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,086
will someday
be running the country,

383
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,216
and you don't want them
to be too screwed up.

384
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,603
Now, who else is
an overachiever?

385
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,681
Come on, now!

386
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:58,847
I am.

387
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,556
I am, too.

388
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,354
Fifth in my class
at Annapolis.

389
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,148
Scaled the summit
of the highest peaks

390
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,901
on six of seven continents.

391
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,993
Hey, that's great.

392
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,738
Don't forget to
bring the scooper

393
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,070
when you
walk the dog.

394
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,525
Ma'am, yes, ma'am!

395
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,624
Now, let's roll.

396
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,736
(grunting)

397
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,786
Sorry, ma'am.

398
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,249
We can't seem to reopen
the hatch to the copter.

399
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,631
You were saying?

400
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,039
Oh, well, I loosened it up.

401
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,718
That is <i>the </i>most
amazing thing

402
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,589
that's ever happened
to this school.

403
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,386
(laughs) Well, yeah, till
they find out about us.

404
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,181
What do you mean "us"?

405
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,524
Well, like, uh,
a-aren't you my girlfriend now?

406
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,101
Oh, you mean,
like you own me?

407
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,396
I'm sorry.

408
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,859
Ugh! You're always
apologizing.

409
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,269
Just tell me
what you want!

410
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,937
You should <i>know</i>
what I want!

411
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,196
I want you to act the same
way two days in a row! Ugh!

412
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,909
I'm not gonna let
you hurt me anymore.

413
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,910
(screams, thuds)

414
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,736
(crying):
He's dead!

415
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,157
I love him!

416
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,616
(breathing loudly)

417
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,866
Oh, he's breathing.

418
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,707
Loser.

419
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,590
He's stopped breathin'!

420
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,136
Who knows gob-to-gob?

421
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,178
You know, mutton hole
to mutton hole.

422
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,064
No one goes near that boy
till the ambulance comes.

423
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,732
Any physical contact violates
our school's no-touch policy.

424
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,983
Let's quickly prod him to the
curb with this pool skimmer.

425
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,145
Good thinking.

426
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,067
Move!

427
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,323
I know CPR!

428
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,824
Nikki, no!

429
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,946
