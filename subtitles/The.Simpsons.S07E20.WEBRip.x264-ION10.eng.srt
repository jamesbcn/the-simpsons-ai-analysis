How come I never heard

162

00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,433
Oh, wait, oh, oh.

176
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,064
Ow!

177
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,351
Bart! Nelson hit me.

178
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,595
He sure did.

179
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,056
(gasps)

180
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,567
A cup holder!

181
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,688
Bart, we gotta stop
and get a cup.

182
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,896
Uh, Bart?

183
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,566
Cruise control, my good man.

184
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,074
Everybody all set back here?

185
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,566
Nelson, good to see you.

186
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,197
Martin, always a pleasure.

187
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,706
(kids screaming)

188
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,126
Oh... Diablo Canyon 2.

189
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,553
Why can't you be more like
Diablo Canyon 1?

190
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,593
(sighs)

191
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,058
(phone ringing)

192
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,599
Hello.

193
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,602
Oh, Homie! Hello.

194
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,524
I can't remember the last time
you called me from...

195
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,194
Oh. You want to speak to Lisa.

196
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,493
Hi, Lisa.
How is your spring break going?

197
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,410
I'm learning about owls.

198
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,489
Oh, owls, eh?
So you probably wouldn't want

199
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,325
to spend another day
at work with me...

200
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,910
Sure, I would.

201
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,955
I can learn about owls
this summer at bird camp.

202
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,798
(grunting)

203
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,508
(gasps)

204
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,838
We've arrived in the vast
cornfields of Canada.

205
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,514
How much farther
to the grammar rodeo?

206
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,143
Grammar rodeo!

207
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,810
We're going to
a grammar rodeo?

208
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,719
We're not going
to a grammar rodeo.

209
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,938
That was just
an alibi, Milton.

210
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,558
-Martin.
-Martin.

211
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,355
-Fellows?
-OTHERS: What?

212
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,768
Where are we going?

213
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,648
Well, I realize it's trite,
but we could tour

214
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,606
the bridges of Madison County.

215
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,577
{\an8}Hey, who has better
vacation ideas than Triple-A?

216
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,408
{\an8}According to the publisher

217
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,543
{\an8}of this triple-a guidebook--
no one.

218
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,120
I've always wanted
to see Macon, Georgia.

219
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,166
Wait, how about a fair?

220
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,790
Not just a county fair.

221
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,916
Not just a Europe fair,

222
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,594
but a world's fair.

223
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,682
The world's fair
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

224
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,048
Keep reading.

225
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,465
The Hungarians have built

226
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,603
a giant, motorized Rubik's cube,

227
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,100
and the fair's symbol
is the Sunsphere

228
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,852
which sits atop a 266-foot-tall
steel shaft.

229
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,606
-What's inside?
-An information desk.

230
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,439
ALL: Cool.

231
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,864
So, it's a choice between
Disney World and Knoxville.

232
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,034
ALL (chanting):
Knoxville! Knoxville! Knoxville!

233
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,374
I concur.

234
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,029
(tires screeching)

235
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,747
You made it!
Did you have any trouble

236
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,291
getting past
the security guards?

237
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,134
Security guards?

238
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,749
-Great! You want to get some lunch?
-Sure.

239
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,586
The way I figure it,

240
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,131
if candy stays
in the machine

241
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,474
for more than a year,
it's up for grabs.

242
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,720
(groaning)

243
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,301
Why do you need me?

244
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,926
Well, it's a two-man operation,

245
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,723
and you're the only
man here I trust. Ready?

246
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,806
Ready.

247
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,096
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

248
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,096
Simpson! What in God's
name are you--

249
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,688
Zagnut bar, Mr. Smithers?

250
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,733
Razzles? Skittles?
Whatchamacallit? Twizzlers?

251
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,606
They all have hilarious names
and are delicious.

252
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:57,664
Well, I am partial
to Jolly Ranchers. Mmm.

253
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,660
Good work, Simpson.

254
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,292
Simpsons.

255
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,160
Boy, Lisa, with you here,
this hardly seems like work at all.

256
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,667
I don't know how I'm
going to make it

257
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,579
through my night shift
without you.

258
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,458
-We can have a slumber party.
-Oh, that'd be great.

259
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,915
Sleeping bags on the floor,
a roaring fire--

260
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,007
It'll be like the time they kicked me out
of the sporting goods store.

261
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,184
(kids yelling, laughing)

262
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,522
If you kids can't keep
your hands to yourself,

263
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,639
I'm going to turn
this car around,

264
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,346
and there'll be no
Cape Canaveral for anybody!

265
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,647
That's it!
Back to Winnipeg!

266
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,697
Bart, can we stop
for ice cream?

267
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,109
Yes.

268
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,487
Bart, can we weigh the car

269
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,334
at that weigh station?

270
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,290
Yeah.

271
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,370
Bart, can we pick up
that hitchhiker?

272
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,075
I don't see why not.

273
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,285
Bart, can we stop
for ice cream?

274
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,586
Yes.

275
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,300
Well, I didn't think
I was rehabilitated,

276
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,970
but I guess they needed
the extra bed.

277
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,553
(sighs)

278
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,556
With Bart gone,
and now you and your father,

279
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,008
I'm not going to have
anyone to--

280
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,138
Thanks, Mom. Bye.

281
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,435
...talk to.

282
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,188
-What is this place?
-Branson, Missouri.

283
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,856
My dad says it's like Vegas

284
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,614
if it were run by Ned Flanders.

285
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,156
Andy Williams!

286
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,622
Oh, we don't need
to stop here.

287
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,462
-Yes, we do!
-Ugh!

288
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,420
ANDY WILLIAMS:
<i>♪ ...my huckleberry friend ♪</i>

289
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:37,211
<i>♪ Moon river ♪</i>

290
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,758
<i>♪ And me ♪</i>

291
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,763
(cheers, applause)

292
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,426
(whistles)
Wow!

293
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,435
I didn't think he was
going to do "Moon River,"

294
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,768
but then, bam,
second encore.

295
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,774
Okay, time
for truth or dare.

296
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,686
-You go first.
-Eh... truth.

297
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,185
Ask me anything.

298
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,606
Who do you love most--
me, Bart, or Maggie?

299
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,447
D'oh! All right, dare.

300
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,832
Okay, why don't you...

301
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,451
Hello, I'd like to speak

302
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,577
with a Mr. Snotball.

303
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,084
First name Ura.

304
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,246
Ura Snotball?

305
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,094
What? How dare you!

306
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,379
If I find out who this is,
I'll staple a flag to your butt

307
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,264
and mail you to Iran!

308
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,972
-Okay, your turn.
-Mmm... truth.

309
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,563
Uh... do you have
a crush on anyone?

310
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,680
Dad.

311
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,846
I won't tell anybody.

312
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,475
Dad, you tell everybody
everything.

313
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,111
Even Moe knew when I
threw up on the dentist.

314
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,689
Moe thinks he knows
a lot more than Moe knows.

315
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,935
Well, just give me
another chance,

316
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,107
and I'll prove
I can keep your secret.

317
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,486
Okay.

318
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,412
I like...

319
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,411
Langdon Alger.

320
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,623
I have no idea who that is.

321
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,794
Nobody does.

322
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,212
(giggling)

323
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,080
He's very quiet
and enjoys puzzles,

324
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,917
but that still doesn't mean
you can tell anyone.

325
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,512
I've already forgotten his name.

326
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,799
It was Larsen something, right?

327
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,432
(giggling)

328
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,179
Thanks, Dad.

329
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,061
Oh, this has been
the best spring break ever.

330
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,518
And with my patented seminar,
you will learn

331
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,309
how to corner the real estate
market through hypnosis.

332
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,154
Why waste your hypnotic powers

333
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,859
on neighbors and co-workers
when...

334
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,569
I can't take this anymore.

335
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,242
(sighs)

336
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,200
(sighs)

337
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,327
(coughing)

338
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,790
(coughing louder)

339
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,959
(groaning)

340
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,830
(crying)

341
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,877
Aw, there, there...

342
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,011
oh, Maggie, there...

343
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,808
We're on the home stretch.

344
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,679
Next stop--
the Knoxville World's Fair

345
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,055
and its fabulous Sunsphere.

346
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,980
Hurry up.
We've only got four days

347
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,437
to spend at the...

348
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,027
"Wod... fir"?

349
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,533
(metallic clatter)

350
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,330
Uh... excuse me.

351
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,371
Is this the World's Fair
visitor's center?

352
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,915
It used to be,
back in 1982.

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,960
You're 14 years too late.

354
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:26,175
But there's another world's fair
coming soon, right?

355
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,178
Before Friday?

356
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,430
What about the Sunsphere?

357
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,971
You mean the Wigsphere.

358
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,305
You're welcome to go up there

359
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,770
if you want to see
16,000 boxes of unsold wigs.

360
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,612
Now, you gentlemen gonna buy
some wigs or ain't ya?

361
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,109
I guess fate was against us.

362
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,362
It's really nobody's fault,
right?

363
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,565
Uh, right?

364
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,316
Well, we've still got a car

365
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,777
and a wad of cash.

366
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,737
Uh, no, we don't.

367
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,997
I must have spent our last $10

368
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,830
on this Al Gore doll.

369
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,415
<i>You are hearing me talk.</i>

370
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,341
I hate this place!

371
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,969
We've got no car.

372
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,471
We've got no money.

373
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,262
And no one knows we're here.

374
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,306
TOGETHER:
We're stranded!

375
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,850
-(crying)
-But on the plus side,

376
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,604
I knocked over the Sunsphere.

377
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,773
NELSON:
Ha-ha!

378
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,899
This never would have happened

379
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,408
if we'd gone to Macon, Georgia.

380
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,279
I'm just saying, is all.

381
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,368
Fellows, I think perhaps
the time has come

382
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,003
to call our parents.

383
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,210
No! They'd kill us.

384
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,789
Look, we got here on our own,

385
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,464
so we can survive here
on our own.

386
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,003
All we need is money, food,
and a way to get home.

387
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,916
Follow me.

388
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,255
Everybody, remember, we're
parked under the Sunsphere.

389
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,599
Hey! I need those to see!

390
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,392
Ah, these lenses are perfect.

391
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,265
Now I can re-bottom
those antique coke bottles.

392
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,023
-300...
-Hey, come back!

393
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,646
400, 500, 600...

394
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,105
Ow! Oh!

395
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,534
500, 400, 300,
200, 100, zero.

396
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,743
Come on!

397
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,075
This train goes
right through Springfield.

398
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,626
(all groaning)

399
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,762
(phone ringing)

400
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,720
Well, of course, I'll accept.

401
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,931
Bart! I've missed you so mu--

402
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,223
You want to speak to Lisa?

403
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,677
So, how's the National
Grammar Rodeo, Bart?

404
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,938
Lisa, I really need your help,

405
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,860
so I 'm gonna let you in on a secret.
There's no such thing.

406
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,018
I knew it! I knew it!
Because why would they have

407
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,147
our national grammar rodeo
in another nation?

408
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,034
Oh, Bart, you're going
to be in so much trouble.

409
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,031
I'm in trouble already.
Here's what happened.

410
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,504
So you've got to think of a way
I can come home for free.

411
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,500
Hmm... you could travel for free
if you were a stewardess.

412
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,344
Well, how badly
do you want to get home?

413
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,800
All right, all right,
how about a courier?

414
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,340
They travel for free too.

415
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,434
No, that's a terrier.
They're dogs.

416
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,098
Well, you sure don't look 25

417
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,351
but your un-laminated
out-of-state driver's license

418
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,893
is proof enough for me.

419
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,266
Here's your first assignment.

420
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,989
{\an8}(speaking Chinese)

421
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,951
{\an8}(speaking Chinese)

422
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,031
What the--

423
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,157
(snoring)

424
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,916
Can we call our parents yet,
Bart?

425
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,998
(phone ringing)

426
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,214
BART (on phone):
<i>Lisa, this isn't working.</i>

427
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,384
I've got to courier something
to Springfield.

428
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,802
And it's got to be big enough

429
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,220
to fit Milhouse, Martin,
and Nelson inside.

430
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,798
Bart, that will cost a fortune.

431
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,014
Simpson, how'd you like
to escort 500 Big Macs

432
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,925
to Marlon Brando's island?

433
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,143
Oh, I can't take
much more of this.

434
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,684
I'm counting on you, Lis.

435
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,775
-(dejectedly) Whee.
-What's wrong, honey?

436
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,610
There's something
troubling me, Dad.

437
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,855
But I don't think I can tell you
because it's a secret.

438
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,617
Well, you don't have to tell me,

439
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,119
but I thought we trusted
each other with our secrets now.

440
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,291
I mean, I haven't told a soul
about your new boyfriend.

441
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,621
Langdon Alger?

442
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,326
I don't like him anymore.

443
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,286
Okay, but you gotta promise
you won't get mad

444
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,376
or tell anyone,
especially Bart.

445
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,711
I promise.

446
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,376
Bart rented a car
with a phony driver's license

447
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,514
and drove Milhouse, Nelson,
and Martin to a wig outlet in Knoxville

448
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,512
and the car got crushed,
and they're out of money

449
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,934
and they can't get home,
and Bart 's working as a courier

450
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:40,932
and just came back
from Hong Kong.

451
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,677
Yes, that's a real pickle.

452
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,847
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

453
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,652
(muffled yelling)

454
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,114
(muffled yelling)

455
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,196
All right, I have thought
this through.

456
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,293
I will send Bart
the money to fly home,

457
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,369
then I will murder him.

458
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,825
No, no! Then he'll know I told!

459
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,416
Dad, you said I could trust you.

460
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,921
(sighs)

461
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,513
Okay, we'll work this out
together.

462
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,049
First things first.
Where is Knoxville?

463
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,603
It's in Tennessee, right next to
the Oak Ridge nuclear facility,

464
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,718
birthplace of
the atomic bomb.

465
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,425
Well, maybe we could
order something from Oak Ridge.

466
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,436
And Bart could
be the courier!

467
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,730
Yello, Oak Ridge?

468
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,903
This is Springfield Nuclear.

469
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,072
We need to order a, uh...

470
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,235
T-437

471
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,742
safety command console.

472
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,413
Springfield, my computer

473
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,122
shows your t-437
is fully operational.

474
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,043
Uh, I suggest you--

475
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,461
Oh, my God!

476
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,919
Oh, God, no!

477
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,749
This can't be happening!

478
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,464
This... you're operating
without a T-437, Springfield!

479
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,295
Ah, sweet mother of mercy!

480
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,301
I mean... I mean, my God!

481
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,473
And have it sent to the Springfield
nuclear power plant

482
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,472
care of Homer J.

483
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,724
No, don't use your real name
or Bart will know!

484
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,477
Forget the name
Homer Simpson.

485
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,308
Have it sent care of
Langdon Alger.

486
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:19,948
MILHOUSE (muffled voice): Bart! Hey,
we really could use another air hole.

487
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,068
Shh! They'll know
you're in there.

488
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,865
(chuckling)

489
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,199
But I don't think
I'd go back again next year.

490
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,117
It's getting too commercial.

491
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,455
They've forgotten it's supposed
to be about the grammar.

492
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,884
(phone ringing)

493
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,376
Hello.

494
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,887
Oh, hello,
Principal Skinner.

495
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,220
No, Bart has never
been to Hong Kong.

496
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,727
{\an8}Good night.

497
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,891

498
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,517
{\an8}Hello.

{\an8}Tennessee state police?

500
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,074
{\an8}No, my son's car was not
crushed in Knoxville.

501
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,401
{\an8}I don't know where
to begin telling you

502
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,775
{\an8}what's wrong with that.

503
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,412
{\an8}(phone ringing)

504
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,908
{\an8}Hello.

505
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,530
{\an8}No, Bart is not
available tomorrow

506
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,997
{\an8}to deliver a human kidney
to Amsterdam.

507

laughing at me?
