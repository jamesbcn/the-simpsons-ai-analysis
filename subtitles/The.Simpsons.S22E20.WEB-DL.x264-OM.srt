1
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:53,833
Ooh!

2
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:06,979
D'oh!

3
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:21,410
Oh!

4
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:34,441
Mm!

5
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,934
Hey... huh?!

6
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,408
Lisa, this is going
too slow for me.

7
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:28,410
And I work at the DMV.

8
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:29,778
Mind if we
take a nap?

9
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:31,396
I'll have to make it
more neo-classical

10
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:33,932
and less Mannerist, but okay.

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,700
You say such
cute little...

12
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:41,189
I jumped in front
of your picture.

13
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:42,491
Now it's ruined.

14
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:45,143
Bart, this isn't a photograph.

15
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:47,145
I'm not gonna
just paint you into my-- aw!

16
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:49,948
You just ruined
six months' work!

17
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:52,083
I'm really sorry
it wasn't a year.

18
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:56,705
Aw! You're gonna regret
the day you were born.

19
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,907
I already do.
It's too close to Christmas.

20
00:02:58,975 --> 00:02:59,824
Ugh!

21
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,887
Not to worry.

22
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,107
Now what?

23
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:20,045
Bart, I'm afraid we need the
help of someone older and wiser.

24
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:25,884
Oh, I get to enjoy this,
but I'm not responsible.

25
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:30,906
Actually, Dad, as the
supervising parent today,

26
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:32,340
you'll get your share
of the blame, too.

27
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:34,442
What do I do?

28
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,677
Patty's gonna kill me.

29
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,095
Unless...

30
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:39,130
I kill her first.

31
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:41,466
I put the body in the car,
I dump the car in the lake,

32
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,568
I put a James Taylor CD
in the stereo

33
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,270
so they think it's a suicide...

34
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,639
Why don't you just cut the paint
out of her hair?

35
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:50,825
Oh, fine, whatever.

36
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,112
I'll just keep cutting
till I hit something solid.

37
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,604
And now, to break the news
as gently as I know how.

38
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:05,240
Wake-up-and-look-at-your-hair!

39
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:09,160
What happened to you?

40
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:20,055
Hmm, actually,
it's kind of cute.

41
00:04:20,122 --> 00:04:22,157
You look like Posh Spice.

42
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,992
That's just what
I was going for.

43
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,910
I was going for Scary.

44
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:27,646
You did this?

45
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:30,765
With your fat fingers and your
brain the size of a Superball?

46
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:37,172
And stay out.

47
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:40,241
I can't believe
I'm saying this...

48
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,043
Homer Simpson, do me.

49
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:45,480
I meant my hair.

50
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:47,299
Oh! Oh...

51
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:48,199
Idiot.

52
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:53,972
Milhouse, check it out.

53
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,873
I put a roadblock
on the curly slide.

54
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:00,695
Isn't this the
greatest day ever?

55
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:03,732
There are
no more great days, Bart.

56
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,100
Just days.

57
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:06,701
What's wrong, man?

58
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:08,753
Something happened
last night.

59
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:12,490
Something that
really changed me.

60
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:15,577
<i>My mom put in the
Finding Nemo DVD,</i>

61
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,612
<i>but then she got
a phone call.</i>

62
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:20,682
<i>So I started it myself.</i>

63
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,120
<i>Did you know it has a chapter
before chapter two?</i>

64
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:28,256
<i>A chapter where we meet
Nemo's mother.</i>

65
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:31,626
Nemo doesn't
have a mother.

66
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:35,063
Not after Chapter One,
he doesn't.

67
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:48,193
If death can happen to a fish,
it can happen to anyone.

68
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,545
You've gotta live life
while you can.

69
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:54,282
So I'm gonna finally proclaim
my love for Lisa.

70
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,518
<i>That's your take-away
from Nemo?</i>

71
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:59,054
I think you've already made
your feelings for Lisa clear.

72
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,056
Well, I can make them
more clear.

73
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:02,791
You see, in the past,
I've been too subtle.

74
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,160
It's my curse-- subtlety!

75
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,232
Homer, thanks to your
unlicensed barbery,

76
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,168
Patty and Selma have been
getting compliments

77
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:14,869
all day at the DMV.

78
00:06:14,937 --> 00:06:16,504
You two look good.

79
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:18,239
Open-casket good.

80
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:19,474
Well!

81
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:22,444
I hear this is the home

82
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,012
of Springfield's hottest
hairdresser.

83
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:27,649
I need a haircut-- and I need
it in three, two, one, now.

84
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:29,217
Lady, I'm not a hairdresser.

85
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:32,203
I just put a new lid
on a couple of trashcans.

86
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:37,275
A hundred dollars?!

87
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:39,577
Marge, how much is
that in smackaroos?

88
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:40,979
One hundred.

89
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:51,473
Wow. Wow.

90
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,373
Wow!

91
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:03,351
Wow!

92
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,421
Hello, airport piano bar.

93
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,339
And it'll look good
in the morning, too.

94
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,675
Are you sure you
don't have a salon?

95
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:12,977
Well, I open
a lot of crazy things

96
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,463
when I'm drunk,
but I don't think so.

97
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,398
Too bad.

98
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:19,634
Just call me
"Homer Fingerhands."

99
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:23,154
I'd rather call you by your
normal name, if that's okay.

100
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,523
But I never knew you
were so good with hair.

101
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:29,494
Marge, when someone loses their
hair, they miss it the most.

102
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:32,247
It's like a beloved dog
that died on your head.

103
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,235
You better not be brushing
your hair again.

104
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,437
Uh, uh, no, I'm, uh...

105
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:41,139
just exploring my body.

106
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:43,057
You better be.

107
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,425
Oh, hair.

108
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,995
I'll love you
when you're old and gray.

109
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:48,296
Huh?

110
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:50,331
Well, two can play at that game.

111
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:58,173
Now that my soft,
chestnut mane is gone,

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,308
I dream of cutting hair,
styling hair,

113
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:04,078
making hair shorter
in exchange for money.

114
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:06,247
Maybe I should open
a hair salon.

115
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:09,818
<i>Well, Newsweek magazine did say
it's good to change careers,</i>

116
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:11,553
right after they laid off
all their editors.

117
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,171
Yeah.

118
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,441
But what if I can't find any
commercial rental property?

119
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:30,672
I really thought people would
like to harvest their own honey.

120
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,207
Oh, how they hated it.

121
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:43,208
Attention, lovers of love.

122
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:45,051
Let it be known by all:

123
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:49,122
Lisa Simpson is
the smartest, sweetest,

124
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,225
most perfectest girl
in the whole world,

125
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:55,629
and I shall not rest
until I am her boyfriend.

126
00:08:57,315 --> 00:09:01,334
I know you like music, Lisa,
so I'm gonna perform a love song

127
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:03,153
I wrote... for you.

128
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:08,875
Oh yeah, it's a theremin.

129
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:15,949

130
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:19,686

♪ Passed out

133
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,613
Okay--
first of all, it's never wise

134
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,514
to use the word "spew"
in a love song.

135
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:35,185

140
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,785
So, Lisa, I love you.

141
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:55,021
Is that love
"requited" or "un"?

142
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:58,959
I'm sorry, but I don't love
you, Milhouse, and I never will.

143
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:07,567
I thought that was beautiful.

144
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:10,937
You did?

145
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:14,407
Yeah. It was romantic
and it rhymed.

146
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:17,544
Well, I used a rhyming
dictionary,

147
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,946
but it only
gives you options.

148
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:23,066
The job of the poet is to say,
"This one, I guess."

149
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,135
I'm Taffy.

150
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:27,771
Would you like to help me
roll the theremin

151
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:29,706
back to the A.V. closet?

152
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:31,107
It's a date.

153
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:36,980
Hm! That theremin has paid
for itself again and again.

154
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,384
All day long, Apu goes
on about Lady Gaga,

155
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:44,154
who is doing nothing that
Rava Khatan was not doing

156
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,791
20 years ago, while she was
a member of Parliament.

157
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:50,210
Oh, now, how could
someone as young as you

158
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:52,028
know about 20 years ago?

159
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:55,031
Oh!

160
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:59,019
Funny how my Timothy always
uses the short-form baptism

161
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,837
when there's a basketball game
he wants to watch...

162
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:02,105
The worst know-it-all!
I can't--

163
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,390
Wears the same pants
for a month!

164
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:04,908
I could just talk on and on!

165
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:13,500
Homie, are you even
listening to me?

166
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:16,353
Because I have
so much to tell you:

167
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,221
The mailman did
the other side of the street

168
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:19,856
before our side.

169
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:21,925
Turns out it was
a substitute.

170
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:23,760
I'm sorry, honey.

171
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:26,896
All day long I have
to listen to women talk.

172
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:28,832
Not a good time!

173
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:36,740
Hey, Lise, those books aren't
gonna pick themselves up.

174
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:38,475
Oh. Usually,
Milhouse does it.

175
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,093
Hey, guys.

176
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:41,494
Uh, Lisa, you
dropped your books.

177
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:42,929
When you pick 'em up,

178
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:44,664
make sure you bend
your knees.

179
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:48,201
You know so much about
body mechanics!

180
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,604
Well, I've worn a lot of
different braces in my time.

181
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,441
This dame is
really into you!

182
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:56,076
She sure is.

183
00:11:56,143 --> 00:11:58,078
This morning I got
to second base...

184
00:11:58,145 --> 00:12:00,447
on our walk around
the softball diamond.

185
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,569
Why would a popular
fifth-grader like Taffy be

186
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:08,471
interested in a Milhouse
like Milhouse?

187
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:10,273
I dunno.
It's one of those mysteries,

188
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:13,343
like how do my clothes get clean
and put back in my drawers?

189
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:15,662
Well, I'm gonna find out
why, because this is...

190
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:19,849
Knees, Lisa!
Knees!

191
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:23,306
Mm-hmm. Oh, yes, right.

192
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,687
Ooh, oh! Mm-hmm.

193
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:27,707
I know Kirk resents
that the dog likes me more,

194
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:32,212
but Rex is just establishing
dominance over the weaker male.

195
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,680
That's what
miniature dachshunds do.

196
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:35,215
Oh, yeah.

197
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:38,084
Men are such dogs,
and vice versa.

198
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:39,886
Is there anyone in here
that just wants

199
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:41,688
a haircut with
no chitchat?

200
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:43,706
No, not me.
No.

201
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:45,825
Hey, I don't want a
conversation.

202
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:48,528
Oh?!
I just want you to listen

203
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:50,747
while I talk about
the loser I'm married to.

204
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:04,561
These are really good scissors.

205
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,133
All day long, they tell me
stupid, pointless,

206
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:14,070
boring stories, and I have
to stand there listening

207
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,873
with a phony grin
plastered on my face.

208
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:17,941
Uh-huh.

209
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,943
Well, Homer,
you're safe here.

210
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,778
You can forget everything
they said.

211
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:36,109
When I look at you,

212
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:38,912
all I see are the foibles that
drive your women crazy!

213
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:41,681
Foibles! Foibles! Foibles!

214
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:42,949
Calm down there, Homer.

215
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:47,287
What got into him?

216
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:49,572
The freaky ad campaign
they're running.

217
00:13:56,522 --> 00:14:00,041
Homer, can you make me
look fan-cy?

218
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:01,876
Sorry, Sarah,
I'm retired.

219
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:03,545
But tonight's
the Policemen's Ball!

220
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:05,213
And if you let
my Sarah down,

221
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:08,400
I can make life
very difficult for you.

222
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,618
I'd like to see you try.

223
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:12,704
Huh, where you goin'?
Excuse me.

224
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:13,955
Uh-uh-uh!

225
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,123
Come on! Would you...?
No, no.

226
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:16,524
Oh, buh!

227
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:19,394
I, uh, I can also make
very annoying noises.

228
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,237
Come on, bro,
don't hassle me!

229
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:31,806
Stop that!

230
00:14:31,874 --> 00:14:33,675
Okay, okay, you win.

231
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:36,344
I'll teach you how
to make love to your wife!

232
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:37,729
What? No!
Just cut her hair!

233
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:39,064
Right.

234
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:44,285
Homer, I thought
you were gonna quit.

235
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:45,687
I can't.

236
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,122
They won't let me.

237
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:49,624
Lenny, be a pal and
saw off my hands.

238
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,309
Why don't you do here
what you do

239
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:53,378
at the nuclear plant--
namely, suck?

240
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:54,746
Suck!

241
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,214
Of course!

242
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:58,049
So, I told Timothy

243
00:14:58,117 --> 00:15:01,286
<i>you cannot keep basing sermons
on old Seinfelds.</i>

244
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,691
Oh, my God.

245
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,127
Like Mozart and
Johnny Knoxville,

246
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:10,762
my genius cannot be stopped!

247
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:15,600
Oh, there's only one way out!

248
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:17,135
I'm committing Barbicide!

249
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,292
Oh, why doesn't anything
kill me?

250
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:30,431
Hmm...

251
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:32,316
Hey, that's Taffy's page.

252
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:35,119
Ooh, I see that she's in
a relationship.

253
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:36,554
Shut up.

254
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:39,056
I just want to know what
she's up to with Milhouse.

255
00:15:39,124 --> 00:15:41,259
A girl like her could get
a fifth-grader,

256
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:42,960
maybe even Kyle LoBianco!

257
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:47,849
I hear he goes to California
on his vacations.

258
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,985
That's the first thing everyone
knows about Kyle LoBianco!

259
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,386
Taffy's up to something.

260
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:55,456
And I won't find out what it is,
sitting at a computer.

261
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:57,692
It's time
to get boots on the ground.

262
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:01,696
You like my boots?

263
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:03,764
Once you get past the
sister ick, they're fine.

264
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:10,471
Oh, my poor Homie.

265
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:14,125
Marge, do you hear it?

266
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:15,359
Listen!

267
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:16,927
It's the hair... growing!

268
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,095
Always growing!

269
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:21,232
Blonde, brunette,
auburn!

270
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,134
This ends now!

271
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:25,203
I need some highlights
for a bridal shower!

272
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,271
You can start with
the rinse! Shoo!

273
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:29,106
Please?!

274
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,408
I'll even buy... product!

275
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:40,652
Here, my love.

276
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,571
Thank you.

277
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:44,373
Anything for
my silly Milly.

278
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:51,980
Who'd follow Milhouse around
like that?

279
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,683
Sneaking around after them
all day has taught me

280
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:56,885
<i>a lot about this sicko.</i>

281
00:16:56,953 --> 00:16:58,487
Evening.

282
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:07,913
I am never gonna get
my homework done tonight.

283
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:20,108
All right, sister,
what's your game?

284
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:23,262
We're just trying

285
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,997
to put our relationship
back together.

286
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:26,965
In the sack,
he's Salisbury steak,

287
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:30,135
everywhere else, creamed corn.

288
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:32,237
I am so sorry.

289
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:37,843
Lisa?

290
00:17:38,978 --> 00:17:41,180
Ugh!
Not her again.

291
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:43,649
Yeah, Lisa,
can't you leave me alone?

292
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:44,950
We're over.

293
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:46,585
You're not over,
you never were!

294
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:48,787
Milhouse,
you're a great guy,

295
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:50,856
but we're not gonna work out
for one reason.

296
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:53,225
Is it 'cause when
I wore cuffed pants

297
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:54,726
they filled up
with leaves?

298
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:57,529
That wasn't
a great day for us.

299
00:17:57,597 --> 00:18:01,099
<i>But it's because you'll
always be in love with her.</i>

300
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,835
He likes his
apple pie warm

301
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:04,303
and his
a la mode cold.

302
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,238
Good luck.

303
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:08,156
You don't want me
to be with you,

304
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:10,592
you don't want me to be
with someone else.

305
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,162
How miserable do I have
to be before you're happy?

306
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:20,085
Milhouse, I, I...

307
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:25,407
Lisa, does this mean
you like me?

308
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:26,875
Yes. No!

309
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,011
I don't know!
It means that...

310
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:31,179
that life is full
of unexpected things

311
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:32,814
and you should
never give up.

312
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:34,216
And you're cute in
the moonlight.

313
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:35,651
Aah!

314
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:41,440
Everything's comin' up Milhouse!

315
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:49,448
Doctor and Mrs.
Julius Hibbert!

316
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:53,068
Mr. Discotheque Stuart,
unaccompanied!

317
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:56,238
My girlfriend
isn't feeling well tonight.

318
00:18:56,306 --> 00:19:01,560
Krusty the Clown and
Disco Stu's girlfriend!

319
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:05,230
Mr. Homer J. and Mrs. Marge
Bouvier Simpson!

320
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:11,169
Her hair!

321
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,189
Move over, Lard Lad statue,

322
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:17,225
it's the eighth wonder
of the Springfield world!

323
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:19,628
You've outdone
yourself, Homer!

324
00:19:21,197 --> 00:19:23,699
Oh, yes, ladies,
I've outdone myself.

325
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:27,369
Outdone myself
by not doing it at all!

326
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:29,204
Stop talking crazy talk!

327
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:31,940
I'm afraid it's all too true.

328
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:33,926
My wife has betrayed me...

329
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:35,494
with another hairdresser!

330
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:37,362
Another hairdresser?

331
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,914
Who is it?
We must know!

332
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:42,501
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Julio is my little secret!

333
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:46,171
I've said too much!

334
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:47,439
Julio?

335
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:49,007
That's right, ladies.

336
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:51,793
And I never heard a complaint I
didn't sympathetically cluck to.

337
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:54,363
That's how I roll.

338
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,932
Okay, first five customers
get a discount.

339
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,651
Next five hear secrets
about the first five.

340
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:00,936
Come on, get in line.

341
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:04,556
It worked perfectly.

342
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:08,260
As if anyone but you could
make me feel this beautiful.

343
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:09,661
Aw, sweetie,
thanks for saving me

344
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,596
from the horrible life

345
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:14,666
<i>Warren Beatty lived
in Shampoo.</i>

346
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:17,235
Now it's time
to pay you back.

347
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:25,711
Oh... ooh...

348
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:28,880
Homie, you're making
my toes curl.

349
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:31,316
You sure know how
to please a woman.

350
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:34,186
As long as it doesn't

351
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,557
involve losing weight
or changing my pants.

352
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:29,773
Shh!
