Aah!

You know, Bart,
when I was your age,

4
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,762
I pulled a few boners.

5
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,934
But I think you'll find that people
are pretty decent

- if you give them half...
- Look! There it is...

7

- The head!
- Kill him!

They got us cornered, boy.

We'll never get away.
Give me the head.

No, Dad.
This whole thing was my fault.

- Son, we're in this mess together.

I beg you to spare our lives.

At least until you've heard
the story of how we ended up

About 23 minutes and 5 seconds.

Well, all right. Go ahead.

We're late for church.

00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,644
Ready for inspection, Mom.

35
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,596
Very nice, Maggie.

36
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,477
And, Lisa, you look lovely.

- Phillips has broken free.
- Get 'em. Get 'em!

- Homer!
- D'

A 64-yard run!
We've got an upset in the making!

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,090
No, we don't.
Try being objective for once in...?

45
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,591
- Let's go, Homer.
- But you don't understand, Marge.

46
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,933
I have 50 bucks riding on this game.

47
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,089
Homer, you promised me.

48
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,428
This isn't gambling, Marge.

49
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,273
- It's a lead-pipe cinch.
- Here's the kickoff.

50
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,270
Wolodarsky takes it at the five.

51
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,562
And my. He fumbles!

52
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,185
- No!
- Another touchdown!

53
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,693
Come on.

54
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,067
Why should I feel like a traffic cop

55

I'm just trying
to get a little goodness

57
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,578
into the family.

58
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,909
Where is the game? Where is it?

59
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:09,245
Got Wolodarsky open in the end zone.

60
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,922
- Catch it. Catch it.
- It's complete. Touchdown!

61
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,921
All right!

62
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,129
Doctor,
we got a barn burner here.

63
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,646
This could be
the most remarkable comeback

64
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,926
since Lazarus rose from the dead.

65
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,971
Laza who?

We're late.

Bart, I want you to promise me

68
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,063
you'll pay attention in Sunday school.

69
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,185
Bart. Bart?

70
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,983
- Bart!
- Whoa! Are you talking to me?

71
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:40,607
What's this?
A personal stereo.

72
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,737
Were you going to listen to rock music
in Sunday school?

73
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,985
Maybe.

74
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,906
Can you believe this, Homer? Homer?

75
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,866
- Homer!
- No, no, no!

76
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,536
We stink. We stink.

77
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,754
The 40, the 30,
the 20, the 10, touchdown!

78
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,125
Homer, were you planning
on sitting in the car

79
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,672
- till the game was over?
- Maybe.

80
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,795
It's because of your irreverent attitude

81
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,842
that Bart thinks he can sneak
headphones into Sunday school.

82
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,177
- Now move it!
- Now here's the kickoff.

83
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,643
Wolodarsky takes it at the five.

84

And, my. He fumbles!

85
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,635
Will my dog Pepper be there?

86
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,477
I'm sorry, but the answer is no.

87
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,483
- Why not?
- Because heaven is for people.

88
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,435
What about my cat Snowball?

89
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,645
I'm sorry, but the answer is no.

90
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,276
- Will there be cavemen in heaven?
- Certainly not.

91
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,743
Um, ma'am, what if you're
a really good person,

92
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,744
but you're in a really,
really bad fight,

93
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,036
and your leg gets gangrene,
and it has to be amputated,

94
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,040
will it be waiting
for you in heaven?

95

"Gambling,
the Eighth Deadly Sin."

Today is Sunday, the Lord's day,

and yet, at this very moment,

102
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,353
millions of Americans
are not in the Lord's house.

103
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,692
They're in their own house
worshipping a false idol...

104
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,519
Professional football.
Lord...

105
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,315
It's a beautiful Sunday.

Perfect football weather

107
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,529
And by the way, this game
is being brought to you

108
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,531
by the good people at Duff beer.

109
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,073
You can't get enough
of that wonderful Duff.

110
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,527
Now they're
lining up for this crucial kick.

111
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,748
One final tick
of the clock remains.

112
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,498
If they win, it will cap
an amazing comeback.

113
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,921
But it's a 49-yard field goal
into the wind.

114

Make it! Make it!
Make it! Make it!

00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,633
- The kick is up.
- Please, please, please, please!

It's good! It's good!
It's good!

118
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,717
It's... good to see
you all in church.

119
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:36,478
- Please, be seated, Homer.
- Yeah, sit down, Homer.

120

- Bart?

123

What about a robot
with a human brain?

124
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,568
I don't know!
All these questions!

125
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,577
Is a little blind faith
too much to ask?

126
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,580
Yay!

127
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,792
Don't forget next week.
Remember to read...

128
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,003
That was very nice, Father.

129
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,004
I was pleased you enjoyed it.

130
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,627
I seemed to have struck a chord
with you today, Homer.

131
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,755
What?
Yeah, you were great.

132
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,763
Homer.

133
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,175
Homer, you embarrassed us

134
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,433
in front of the whole congregation.

135
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,305
And today's sermon was one
you should have really listened to.

136
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,943
- What was it about?
- Gambling.

137
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,359
He didn't say that
under certain circumstances

138
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,860
it was all right, did he?

139
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,151
No! Look, I don't want
to talk about this anymore

140
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,275
in front of the kids.

141
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,241
Lisa, Bart,

142
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,451
what did you two learn
in Sunday school today?

143
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,622
The answers to deep
theological questions.

144
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,081
Yeah. Among other things,
apes can't get into heaven.

145
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,253
What?
Those cute little monkeys?

146
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,541
That's terrible.

147
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,674
- Who told you that?
- Our teacher.

148
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,101
I can understand
how they wouldn't let in

149
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,958
those wild jungle apes,

150
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,626
but what about those really
smart ones who live among us,

151
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,336
who roller-skate
and smoke cigars?

152
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,927
Cool, man.
"Space Mutants 4."

Drop me off!
Drop me off!

00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,057
- No way, Jose.
- Marge, they're only space mutants.

155
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,443
I know what
those movies are like.

156
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,270
Killing innocent people,
eating human flesh.

You'll just get
a lot of bad ideas.

158

Hey, Dad.
Can I have five bucks?

159
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,072

Hey, man, leave the kid alone.
I like him.

176
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,710
- You do?
- Yeah, you're witty.

177
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,040
- So what's your name, man?
- I'm Bart Simpson.

178
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,955
This here's Kearny,
and I'm Jimbo.

179
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,804
You don't need an introduction.
You're the worst kid in school.

180
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,340
- Thanks.
- Psst. Coast is clear.

181
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,835
You guys are sneakin' in?

182
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,098
Yeah.
Only saps pay to see movies.

183
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,810
Hey, Bart, come on!

184
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,690
But sneaking into a movie is
practically stealing, man.

185
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,439
- "Practically"?
- It is stealing.

186
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,572
Well, okay.

187
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,028
I just wanted to make sure
we weren't deluding ourselves.

188
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,162
Wait! I think
I hear something.

189
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,747
Come on.
Loosen up, babe.

190
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,423
There's nobody here
but you and me.

191
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,922
No. Stop it!

192
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,376
I think I hear something...
not human.

193
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,766
Let's get romantic.

194
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,810
Well, okay.

195
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,225
You little sneaks,
you're coming with me.

196
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,606
Next time you little
hoodlums try this,

197
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,823
- I'm calling your parents!
- Yeah?

198
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,593
Well, we don't wanna see
your crummy movie anyway.

199
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,914
Yeah.
We'll take our business elsewhere.

200
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,281
You know, Bart.

201
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:22,077
I've been kicked out of
all four "Space Mutant" movies.

202
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,333
Wow, man.

203
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,090
Three jumbo cherry squisheys,

204
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,972
and one double jumbo
original flavor, sir.

205
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,219
Okay.

206
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,640
Don't you kids take anything.

207
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,598
I'm watching you.

208
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,098
I've got eyes in the back of my head.

209
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,812
- Four fifty-two.
- Don't worry, guys. It's on me.

210
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,943
Share the wealth.
That's what I always say.

211
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,110
Guys?

212
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,730
Guys?

213
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,736
Hey, guys. Where'd you get
all that great stuff?

214
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,739
Five-finger discount, man.

215
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,323
You ripped it off?

216
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,076
Yeah. Thanks for
covering for us, man.

217
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,050
Go on, Bart.

218
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,089
But that guy founded Springfield.

219
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,303
He built our first hospital
out of logs and mud.

220
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,845
If it weren't for him,
all the settlers would have died

221
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,309
in the great blizzard of '48.

222
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,350
So?

223
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,649
So...

224
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,649
watch me hit him
right between the eyes.

225
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,647
Hey, what are you doing there?

226
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,895
Show a little respect,
you insolent little thugs.

227
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,487
- Ooh.
- We're really scared.

228
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:43,703
Hey! Hey, you!
Hey! Hey, you!

229
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,246
You know, when you
look up at clouds in the sky,

230
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,844
they start looking like stuff.

231
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,550
- No, they don't.
- Yeah, they do.

232
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,801
Like that one over there
looks just like a cherry bomb.

233
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,474
Hey, you're right.
And look at that one.

234
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,555
It looks like a guy
with a switchblade

235
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,930
stuck in his back.

236
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,016
Yeah, that one
looks like a school bus

237
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,692
going over a cliff in flames

238
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,270
with kids inside screaming.

239
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,855
That one looks just like
the statue of our town founder,

240
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,692
Jebediah Springfield.

241
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,947
- Does not.
- Does too.

242
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,529
I mean, without the head, of course.

243
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,244
Yeah.

244
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,374
I wish someone really would
cut his ugly old head off.

245
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,373
- You do?
- Yeah, that'd be cool.

246
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,495
Sure would cheese everybody off.

247
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,882
But, guys, come on.
Don't you remember history class?

248
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,800
Jebediah once killed
a bear with his bare hands.

249
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,420
Sorry.

250
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,756
We forgot how much you love
Jebediah Springfield.

251
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,433
- Yeah, he's your boyfriend.
- Yeah!

252
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,682
- Come on, guys. Knock it off.
- Beat it, Simpson.

253
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,766
Man, I thought you were cool.

254
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,738
Beat it, Simpson.

255
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,741
Man, I thought you were cool.

256
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,995
Aha!

257
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,667
Wow! Look at these
bowling balls, Maggie.

258
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,672
Can you think of a better
way for Daddy to spend

259
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,804
his hard-won 50 bucks?

260
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,934
Now I've seen everything.

261
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,850
Black, marbleized
with a liquid center.

262
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,770
"The Stealth Bowler:

263
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,768
The pins don't know
what hit them."

264
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,770
Dad, can I talk to you
about something?

265
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,852
Sure, boy.
What's on your mind?

266
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,818
Well, I was wondering.

267
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,568
How important is it
to be popular?

268
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,321
I'm glad you asked, son.

269
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,412
Being popular is the most
important thing in the world.

270
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,119
So, like, sometimes
you could do stuff

271
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,699
that you think is pretty bad

272
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,794
so other kids
will like you better?

273
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,759
You're not talking about
killing anyone, are you?

274
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,658
No.

275
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,077
- Are you?
- No!

276
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,665
Then run along, you little scamp.

277
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,040
A boy without mischief

278
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,046
is like a bowling ball
without a liquid center.

279
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,276
What have I done?

280
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,373
Bart, are you all right?

281
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,745
Yeah.
Top of the world, Ma.

282
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,834
Well, then,
come down for breakfast.

283
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,458
♪♪ -Ooh! Look at this one.

284
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:25,375
"The Hammer of Thor:
It will send your pins to...

285
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,179
Val-halla." Lisa?

286
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,470
Valhalla is where Vikings
go when they die.

287
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,144
That's some ball.

288
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,272
Good morning, everybody.

289
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,185
We interrupt
"Mambo in the Morning"

290
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,480
to bring you this
special news bulletin.

291
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,924
The statue
of Jebediah Springfield,

292
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,941
our illustrious town founder,

293
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,606
was brutally decapitated last night...

294
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,105
in an act of senseless vandalism.

295
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,328
We now go to Police Chief Wiggum
at City Hall.

296
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:58,674
Well, we have no witnesses,
no suspects, and no leads.

297
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,829
If anyone has any information,

298
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,128
please dial "O"
and ask for the police.

299
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,093
That number again, "O."

300
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,054
Stay tuned to this station

301
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,184
for further developments
as they break.

302
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,892
- It's just a statue.
- It's a statue of

303
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,854
the trailblazing founder
of our town.

304
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,734
It's a symbol
of what we can all do

305
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,851
if we put our minds to it.

306
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,687
Just a statue?

307
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,232
Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue?

308
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,646
Is the Leaning Tower of Pizza
just a statue?

309
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,145
School bus.

310
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,448
Come on, Lis.
School bus.

311
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,082
Go on, Lisa.

312
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,038
We've all got to be brave,
just like Jebediah

313
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,579
- when he killed that bear.
- It's so awful.

314
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,713
Okay, come on,
come on, everybody.

315
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,250
We gotta get on with our lives.

316
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,554
Let's try and put
this tragedy behind us.

317
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,548
You're right, Moe.

318
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,720
A beer, please, and make sure
there's a head on it.

319
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,681
I said it before,
and I'll say it again,

320
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,393
"Hell in a handbasket!"

321
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,894
I hope they find
the punk who did this,

322
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,767
and I hope
they cut his head off.

323
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,355
Yeah!

324
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Hi, guys. What's up?

325
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,085
We were saying we'd love
to meet the guy

326
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,572
who cut off
the head of that statue.

327
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,953
Yeah, we wish he were
here right now.

328
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,783
Really?

329
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,867
Yeah, we'd break every bone
in his stupid little body.

330
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,583
Yeah, that's right, man.

331
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,423
- Limb by limb.
- Yeah!

332
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,288
What? But-But yesterday,

333
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,706
didn't you say it would be cool

334
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,464
to cut off the head,

335
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,376
and really cheese everybody off?

336
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,425
Yeah, that was
just cloud talk, man.

337
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,678
Yeah.
I mean, throwing rocks is one thing,

338
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,681
but I would never
cut the head off of a guy

339
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,223
who iced a bear
with his bare hands.

340
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,557
- So what's in the bag, Bart?
- My head.

341
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:44,522
I said, what's in the bag, Bart?

342
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,645
Go ahead, Bart. Tell them.

343
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,613
It's the head of Jebediah Springfield.

344
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,235
I gotta go!

345
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,412
Look what you've done.

346
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,121
You wanted to be popular.

347
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,542
Now you're the most
hated boy in town.

348
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,542
You're not really talking to me.

349
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,254
You're just my overactive imagination.

350
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,174
- I am, am I?
- Shut up.

351
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,513
I wanted them to like me.

352
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,719
The child seems rattled.

353
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,890
- Can you blame him?
- No. No, I can't.

354
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,561
There, there, Mr. Burns. Blow, sir.

355
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,728
Hey, Bart, where are you going?

356
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,694
- To my room.
- Why don't you watch "Krusty the Clown?"

357
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,275
There's someone
out there in Krustyland

358
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,661
who has committed an atrocity.

359
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,408
If you know who cut off
Jebediah's head...

360
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,301
I don't care if it's
your brother, your sister,

361
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,196
your daddy or your mommy...

362
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,536
Turn them in,
and Krusty will send you

363
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,382
a free slide whistle
just like Sideshow Bob's.

Wait a minute.

00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,505
I hope you're not planning to do
what I think you're doing.

367
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,763
Sorry, man.
It's either you or me.

368
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,346
You know, Bart,

369
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,180
you don't have to found a town
to be a hero.

370
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,387
Sometimes a hero
could be a young boy

371
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,687
with the courage to stand up
and admit he's made a mistake.

372
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,323
Yeah, well, I'm running
a little short on courage right now.

373
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,321
Aah!

374
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,113
Anyway, think about it,
will you, son?

375
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,745
Jebediah Obediah
Zachariah Jedediah Springfield

376
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,750
came West in 1838.

377
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,752
Along the way,
he met a ferocious bear

378
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,754
and killed it
with his bare hands.

379
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,626
That's "B-A-R-E" hands.

380
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,264
Although modern historians
recently uncovered evidence

381
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,761
that the bear, in fact,
probably killed him.

382
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,854
- But whether bear killed man...
- Mom. Dad.

383
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,932
- I knew it all along!
- Why, Bart? Why?

384
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,848
Yeah, why?
You little...

385
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,396
Because I wanted some
really bad kids to like me.

386
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,941
Somehow I got the idea
that being popular

387
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,936
was the most important
thing in the world.

388
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,448
Where did you get
a ridiculous idea like that?

389
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,025
Lay off the boy, Marge.

390
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,407
He's a good kid.

391
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,333
Quit giving him the third degree.

392
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,332
Homer, did you
have something to do with this?

393
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,035
Well, maybe
I am a little responsible.

394
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,746
- A little?
- Come on, son.

395
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,917
Let's take the head thing
back to the authorities.

396
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,297
You know, Bart,
when I was your age,

397
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,306
I pulled a few boners.

398
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,468
But I think you'll find that
people are pretty decent

399
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,437
- if you give them half...
- Look! There it is...

400
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,688
- The head!
- Kill 'em!

401
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,194
- All right. All right.
- All right, already.

402
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,446
- We know this part.
- Yeah, right.

403
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,409
Well, that's my story.

404
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,030
And if you still wanna tear apart

405
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,906
this young Sunday school student

406
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,003
as he stands on the brink of salvation,

407
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,920
I await your wrath.
But I'd like to add one thing:

408
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,839
it wasn't until I removed
the head of Jebediah Springfield

409
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,421
that we realized we were
taking our heritage for granted.

410
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,466
That was a crime too.

411
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,889
One I think we are all guilty of.

412
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,530
- Well, the kid's got us there.
- Hey, he's right.

413
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,974
Got a point there.

414
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,276
And I know that I'll always feel
an inner shame far greater

415
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,598
than any punishment you could dish out.
Far, far greater.

416
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,267
Far, far, far, far greater.

417
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,935
Aw!

418
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,193
Somehow I don't feel
like killing anymore.

419
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,487
Neither do I.

420
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,699
Dad.

421
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,241
Forgive me, sir.

422
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,365
No problem, Bart.

Look!
It's glorious.
