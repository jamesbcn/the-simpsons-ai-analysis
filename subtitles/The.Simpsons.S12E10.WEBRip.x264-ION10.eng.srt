(groans)

21
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,189
{\an8}What the--

22
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,149
{\an8}-My juice box! Ohh!
-Oh, sorry, Homie.

23
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,363
{\an8}But you promised to take me
to the Apron Expo today.

24
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,664
{\an8}-Just give me 10 more hours.
-Come on.

25
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:57,029
{\an8}You and the kids always
want to do fun stuff.

26
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,037
{\an8}But today
we're doing something I like.

27
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,539
{\an8}(groans)

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,540
{\an8}They're unveiling
a combination apron-smock.

29
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,844
-It's called a "smapron."
-Did you say "smockron"?

30
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,999
{\an8}-No, smapron.
-Oh.

31
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,218
{\an8}-(snoring)
-Come on. It'll be fun!

32
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,679
{\an8}Man, that was a good Apron Expo!

33
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,102
{\an8}I'm gonna wear my apron
on the Fourth of July.

34
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,021
{\an8}And this lead apron
will keep me safe downstairs.

35
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,561
{\an8}(chuckles) "Grrrl Power."

36
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,685
{\an8}Eh, I'm a little disappointed.
There were too many aprons.

37
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,034
{\an8}It was great, all right.

38
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,650
{\an8}But all I want to do right now
is hit the adjustable sack

39
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,527
{\an8}with a good juice box.

40
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,954
{\an8}Because when all is said
and done--

41
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,583
"Prison Rodeo...

42
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,581

{\an8}WARDEN (on P.A.): Welcome
to Waterville State Penitentiary.

00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,535
{\an8}The contestants you'll see
today are actual prisoners

45
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,957
{\an8}on a break from their
telemarketing duties.

46
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,297
{\an8}Now, here comes
our first outlaw!

47
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,474
{\an8}-(bell rings)
-Yee-haw! (groans)

48
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,974
{\an8}-(all gasp)
-Doggy.

49
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,016
{\an8}Well, don't feel too bad
for him, folks.

50
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,230
{\an8}He's in here for erecting
a nativity scene

51
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,691
{\an8}on city property.

52
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,230
{\an8}(all boo)

53
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,234
{\an8}There's so much evil
in the world.

54
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,317
{\an8}-(crowd cheering)
-(calf lowing)

55
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,029
WARDEN: No, Delbert.

56
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,414
We're not
slaughtering the animals.

57
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,451
It's not like that, Warden.
We was just havin' a conversation.

58
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,616
-Ain't that right?
-Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,955
{\an8}WARDEN:
Next up's a real lowlife.

60
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,920
{\an8}Bob Dylan wrote a song
to keep him in prison.

61
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,502
{\an8}-(bull grunting)
-Say hello to Jack Crowley.

62
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,258
-(bellowing)
-Yee-haw!

63
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,091
Go, bull! Toss his salad!

64
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,257
-(groans)
-(cheering)

65
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,097
{\an8}Oh, he's down!

66
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,272
And it looks like old Tornado

67
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,981
wants to caramelize
his creme brulee!

68
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,322
-Yeah, do that!
-Somebody help him!

69
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,528
Relax, they got rodeo clowns.

70
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,153
Is my lipstick even?

71
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,737
Go like this. (popping)

72
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,951
MARGE: Hey! Hey, over here!

73
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,952
Here, bully, bully,
bully, bully, bully!

74
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,794
That's not gonna do it, Marge.
You need something red.

75
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,750
Whoa!

76
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,539
Hey, Toro!
Here's something to gore!

77
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,503
(bull bellowing)

78
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,922
-Dad!
-Not now, honey. Daddy's busy.

79
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,841
(bellowing)

80
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,131
-(snorting)
-Now for a little calming blue.

81
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,007
-Hey, where's your blue shirt?
-I don't have a blue shirt.

82
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,215
Yow!

83
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,231
-(shouts, groans)
-What the-- (grunting)

84
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,151
(all screaming)

85
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,526
{\an8}Maybe it's the tear gas.
(sniffles)

86
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,068
O-- Or maybe this was
the best damn prison rodeo ever.

87
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,323
(man groaning softly)

88
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,250
How's your back, Homie?

89
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,709
I can't complain.

90
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,039
Nah, that's for the prisoners.
You can complain all you want.

91
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,417
Oh, God, my back!
It hurts so much!

92
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,586
And my job is so unfulfilling!

93
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,006
Try to focus on something else.

94
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,715
Mmm, you like Jimi Hendrix,
right?

95
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,476
-Uh-huh.
-Well, look at that painting.

96
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,349
Wow, the artist really captured
Jimi's passion and intensity.

97
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,358
HOMER:
And his fondness for the guitar.

98
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,190
Thank you kindly, ma'am.
They won't give us art supplies

99
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,986
so I had to paint it with pudding.

100
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,488
-A convict painted that?
-Yep.

101
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:27,083
Well, I studied art,
and this guy's got a real gift.

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,290
You kiddin'? Look.

103
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,080
He painted a unicorn
in outer space.

104
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,375
I'm asking you.
What's it breathing?

105
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,669
-Air.
-Ain't no air in space.

106
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,093
There's an Air in Space Museum.

107
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,262
-(bones cracking)
-Oh, God! My back!

108
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,352
Let's get out of this
gosh-forsaken heck-hole.

109
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,468
(groaning) All right.

110
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,981
MARGE:
Oh, what a waste of talent.

111
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:53,904
(gasps)

112
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,978
A sunset.

113
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,074
(wind whistling)

114
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,069
(sighs)

115
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,079
(sighs)

116
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
(groaning)

117
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,705
(grunting)

118
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,881
They are coming back for us,
aren't they?

119
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,789
I don't know.

120
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,917
(grunting continues)

121
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,759
(groaning)

122
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,182
-How's your back, Dad?
-Well, there's a dull ache certainly.

123
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,932
And overlaid on that
is a club sandwich of pain.

124
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,175
Only instead of bacon there's agony.

125
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,517
Marge, can I have a BLT?

126
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,733
What are you looking at?

127
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,227
Oh, nothing.

128
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,237
How would you feel if I did
some volunteer work at the prison?

129
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,530
First, I'd feel like having a BLT--
then proud of you.

130
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,287
Oh, Homie, I knew you'd support me.

131
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,250
(blows a kiss)

132
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,000
-(cracking)
-Oh, my back!

133
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,210
Hmm?

134
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,966
Mrs. Marge Simpson.
I'm here to teach an art class.

135
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,970
Ooh, art class.

136
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,352
La-di-da.

137
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,220
(buzzer buzzes)

138
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,179
This is Ike Pross.
He's going to solitary.

139
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,728
Ooh, solitary.

140
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,022
-La-di-da.
-(buzzer buzzes)

141
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,570
Welcome to
"Freeing the Artist Within."

142
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,151
Not literally, of course.
(giggling)

143
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:27,993
(gun cocks)

144
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,332
OK. Now, I wanted to paint fresh fruit.

145
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,199
But the prison cafeteria
would only give me sauerkraut.

146
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,328
-(inmates groaning)
-That's depressing.

147
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,326
Let's let a little sunshine in.

148
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,803
(inmates groaning)

149
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,800
-(groans) Question?
-Can I smell your dress?

150
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,683
(all laugh)

151
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,969
Hey, you show some respect.

152
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,763
-This one here's not for smellin'.
-(grunts)

153
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:58,978
-Why thank you, Jack.
-No problem. Now, let's paint.

154
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,401
Hey, can I smell your clothes?

155
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,490
(whistles) Your spine is more twisted
than Sinbad's take on marriage.

156
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,658
-(laughing)
-So? Just give me some drugs and surgery.

157
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,659
Oh, I'd love to. But to be honest...

158
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,871
modern medicine has a lousy record
of treating the back.

159
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,914
We spend too much time on the front.

160
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,537
Yeah, there's some neat stuff
on the front.

161
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,335
I'm gonna send you
to my chiropractor.

162
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:26,208
Hey, I thought real doctors
hated chiropractors.

163
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,717
Well, that is our official stance.

164
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,258
But between you, me and my golf clubs,
they're miracle workers.

165
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,434
(grunting)

166
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,024
That's charming, Sardonicus.

167
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,689
But try to use less
of a stabbing action

168
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,559
and more of a brushing stroke.

169
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,477
Yeah. See how much
better that feels?

170
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,316
Yes. Much better.

171
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,113
Oh, Jack. That's so soulful.

172
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,617
How did someone
so sensitive end up here?

173
00:08:55,701 --> 00:09:00,541
Well, if you really gotta know,
I shot a guy named Apu.

174
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,793
Oh.

175
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,167
Well, you know,
lots of people shoot Apu.

176
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,594
It's just a hundred-dollar fine now.

177
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,053
Maybe I belong in here.
I got a lotta anger.

178
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:16,853
I don't see any anger.
I see a yearning for freedom.

179
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,931
Um, do you have a title?

180
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,636
"A Time to Kill."

181
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,265
Titles are hard.

182
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,280
Hello, Homer. I'm Dr. Steve.
Please lie down.

183
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,735
Mmm. (snoring)

184
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,276
Get-- Wake up, Homer!

185
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,287
Huh?
Less yakkin', more crackin'!

186
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,119
Now, Homer,
we don't actually crack backs.

187
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,035
It's merely an adjustment.

188
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,464
OK, you're gonna hear
a loud cracking sound.

189
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,503
-(loud cracking)
-There we go.

190
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,917
-Hey. It feels a little better.
-Mm-hmm.

191
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,468
I thought it might.

192
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,351
Now, I'll need to see you three times
a week for, uh, many years.

193
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,310
(humming)

194
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,729
-So how was it in the slammer?
-Terrific.

195
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,690
Bart, Sideshow Bob says
he'll be seeing you real soon.

196
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,522
(chuckles) That Bob!

197
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,608
Oh, and guess who's up for parole.
My diamond in the rough.

198
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,405
-That scary guy?
-Scary talented.

199
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,830
And I'm gonna make sure
the parole board knows it.

200
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:19,789
You gonna bribe 'em?

201
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,869
Well, I might grease the wheels of justice
with some cookies.

202
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,916
-Oh, can I have some?
-Not till you finish your sundae.

203
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,421
Ohh! (gulps, gasps)

204
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,974
-Is that enough?
-Two more bites!

205
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,639
I'm sure your macaroons
are scrumptious, Marge.

206
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,642
But I've seen this warden
turn down brownies--

207
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,814
honest to goodness brownies!

208
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,732
Next! (munching)

209
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,309
Oh, it's you.

210
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,647
Well, just let me ink up
my old "denied" stamp.

211
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,244
Warden, please.
This man is a gentle soul.

212
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,701
I know he's made mistakes,
but someone with his talent

213
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:03,043
belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures,
not behind bars.

214
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,370
Lady, I know he charmed you
with some "pleases" and "thank-yous,"

215
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,537
but he wasn't so polite
to the guy he shot.

216
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,667
Actually he was.

217
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,303
He waited with me till the ambulance came
then ran like a deer.

218
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,382
Well, that's mighty nice.

219
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,677
But if I let this creep out,

220
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,510
would you like him skulking
around your neighborhood?

221
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,216
Honestly, it wouldn't bother me.

222
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,810
(whispering, indistinct)

223
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,391
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Well, lady, I'm gonna call your bluff.

224
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:30,057
The prisoner is hereby
paroled into your custody.

225
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,647
(gasps) Oh-Oh, my goodness.

226
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,823
I'm free? Oh, Mrs. Simpson.

227
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,952
-(choking)
-Oh, geez, I'm sorry.

228
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,030
Sorry.

229
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,083
You won't regret this.

230
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,713
I hope this is OK.

231
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,630
-It's not very prison-y.
-It's more than I deserve, ma'am.

232
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,000
Now, which way is Mecca?
'Cause I gotta do a little prayin'.

233
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,338
Uh, Mecca? Well, let--

234
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,965
Nah! (laughing)
I'm just yanking your chain!

235
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,143
(laughing) I'm Jewish.

236
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,432
-(groaning)
-(cracking)

237
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,937
Ow! Oh, my back.
Dr. Steve didn't do anything!

238
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,021
-Did you do those exercises he gave you?
-Yeah, right.

239
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,858
I did 'em while you were studying.

240
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,783
(both laugh)

241
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,401
-Ow!
-(cracking)

242
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,367
-Oh! Ow!
-Dad, are you OK?

243
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:25,119
Yeah. In fact, I feel fantastic!

244
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,502
(laughing)

245
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,710
That trash can must've
unkinked your back!

246
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,880
Not trash can, son.
Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder!

247
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,261
-Patent pending.
-OK, OK.

248
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,928
And as you can see,
the unique dents in my invention...

249
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,799
perfectly match the contours
of the human "vertebrains."

250
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,178
Hmm. Patent pending,
patent pending, patent pending.

251
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,346
-Hey, who's this guy?
-You remember Jack.

252
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:55,106
He's that talented painter
who had a little brush with the law.

253
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,401
You brought a convict to live here
near my unpatented idea?

254
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,697
I seen your idea, and I don't want it.
All I need is three squares and a job.

255
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,833
That's right, a job.

256
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,583
I know just where you can get one.

257
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,666
So, Homer, you think
you can fix my sciatica?

258
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,092
Hmm. I don't know what that is,
so I'm gonna say yes.

259
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,342
{\an8}-Now go limp.
-I'm limp.

260
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,054
{\an8}-One, two, better not sue.
-(groaning)

261
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,965
{\an8}(cracking)

262
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:29,772
Hey, it worked! My searing leg pain
is now a gentle numbness.

263
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,730
Next!

264
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,480
Yes, uh, my car seems to have broken down,

265
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,612
and I was wondering
if I could use your--

266
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,859
-Oh! That's a pushing motion!
-(cracking)

267
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,612
Simpson, you're not
a licensed chiropractor.

268
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,533
And you're stealing patients
from me and Dr. Steffi.

269
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,573
Boy, talk about irony.

270
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,867
The AMA tries to drive
you guys out of business.

271
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,872
Now you're doing the same to me!

272
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,961
-Think about the irony.
-(grunts)

273
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,920
-(groans)
-You've been warned. Stop chiropracting!

274
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,751
Not unless you think
about the irony!

275
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,222
I read in the Daily Fourth Gradian

276
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,969
that you need someone
to paint a mural.

277
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,601
Yes. School spirit
is down 3.4 percent.

278
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,309
Well, Jack here
will do great work for you.

279
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,310
Oh, any references?

280
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,225
Well, to be honest with you,

281
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,309
I spent the last six years
in Waterville State--

282
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,895
It's a small liberal arts college.

283
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,441
Very law-abiding.
No convicts at all.

284
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,685
Well, the only other one
to apply was Moe Szyslak

285
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,857
and his stuff scares
the hell out of me.

286
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,576
Eww! How could anyone
consider that making love?

287
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,618
All right, Jack. You're hired.

288
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,122
I'll clear you out a cubby.

289
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,999
-You told a lie for me.
-I know.

290
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:38,592
But the Lord will forgive me
if it helps you get a second chance.

291
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,129
(sighs) Actually, Marge, it's the third
if you count that farm couple.

292
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,094
Farm couple?

293
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,683
But I got a good feelin' about this one,
Marge. I really do.

294
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,639
(worried murmur)

295
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,984
That is awesome.
Finally, art that doesn't suck.

296
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,981
Dear Lord! What are you doing?

297
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,323
-You don't like it?
-No, no! It's all wrong.

298
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,990
A shapely female form has no place in art.

299
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,279
But, uh, what I thought is--

300
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,662
I sketched out exactly what I wanted.

301
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,240
Yeah-- No--
But see what I was goin' for was--

302
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,285
Did you even look at the napkin?

303
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,998
Oh, I was in the zone that day.

304
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,460
Yeah. You see, I didn't want
to go so cutesy-wootsy.

305
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,252
-Because...
-Because it's not my style.

306
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,798
Well, if you want to keep this job,
you'll make it your style.

307
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,763
All right.
You're the boss man, ain't ya?

308
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,554
Darn right I'm the boss.

309
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,138
Don't forget I can send you back
where you came from, college boy.

310
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,144
(groans)

311
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,646
(grunting)

312
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,701
That punk Skinner.
I had more freedom back at the joint.

313
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:52,329
Oh, Jack, I know you hate to betray
your artistic vision, but just do it.

314
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,749
-I guess I could bend a little.
-Just till you make it.

315
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:59,379
Remember, I believe in you.

316
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,125
(grunting) Thanks, Marge.

317
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,632
Listen, if you're done
with that washing machine,

318
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,843
can I make some booze in it?

319
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,933
-Not until you finish your sundae.
-Yes, ma'am.

320
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:14,469
-(groaning)
-What's wrong with my sundaes?

321
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,976
Careful, I'm frail. (grunting)

322
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,189
(cracking)

323
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:23,113
-OK, that should do it, Moe.
-Hey, it don't hurt no more.

324
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,400
Ha! Now I can focus on
my crippling emotional pain.

325
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,355
Oh, Daddy, Daddy, why?
Why won't you hug me?

326
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,238
You hugged the mailman!

327
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,123
Excuse me, sir.
Is this El Clinico Magnifico?

328
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,541
Ah, you saw our bus ad.

329
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,500
We'd, uh, like to invest in
your spinal adjustment device.

330
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,542
We might be able to do business.
(stifled squeal)

331
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,707
We'll need to take some photographs.

332
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,586
Hey, where you going with that?

333
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,343
(grunting)

334
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,933
Wait a minute.
No investor could bend like that!

335
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,644
They're chiropractors!

336
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,774
-(both grunting)
-Come on, come on. Let's go!

337
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,234
(tires screech)

338
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,977
No! My Spine-O-Cylinder!

339
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,776
They'll pay for what
they did to my can!

340
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,282
Forget it, Homer.
It's Chiro-town.

341
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,198
You know, when Superintendent Chalmers
suggested a school mural,

342
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,288
I almost thought he said a school Muriel.
(laughs)

343
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,381
Muriel's his sister.

344
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,755
-And, uh-
-(gun cocking)

345
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,837
-Oh, thank you, Bruce Vilanch.
-Whoopi would've made it work.

346
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:38,927
And now I present Puma Pride
by a college-educated artist--

347
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,886
-ALL: Ooh!
-Jack Crowley.

348
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,847
(applauding)

349
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,975
-Man, is that wimpy.
-(groans) What happened to the cool one?

350
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,398
-Well, my original idea was--
-Jeepers, that's sugary even for my taste.

351
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,658
-Yeah, but Skinner said I had--
-(crowd murmuring)

352
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,330
Skinner! How are we going to raise
school spirit with this sappy hokum?

353
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,042
I know, sir.
It's an embarrassment.

354
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,253
This isn't what I wanted.
Where's the edge?

355
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,665
I followed your napkin.

356
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,224
No napkin could wipe
the crumbs of failure from your mouth!

357
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,549
-No! No, don't fight.
-(grunts)

358
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,845
All great art
is controversial at first.

359
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,770
But years from now, people will point
to these cuddly little creatures and say,

360
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,981
"That's a Jack Crowley."

361
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:25,942
(groaning)

362
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,982
Now, uh, pizza's working well
on Thursday.

363
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,488
But I think the kids
will follow it to Tuesday.

364
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,160
That's what you said
about the stuffed peppers,

365
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,200
and you lost the young males!

366
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,873
-Principal Skinner, the school's on fire!
-(gasps)

367
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,334
CHILDREN:
Spread, spread, spread!

368
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,794
-Spread, spread, spread!
-It's crystal clear who did this--

369
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,915
Jack Crowley!

370
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,131
No way. You don't know
that Jack did this.

371
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,093
-Just because he's an ex-con-- Ooh!
-Crowley's an ex-con?

372
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,085
Dear Lord, I've peed
in front of him!

373
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,927
Hey, check it out!

374
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,351
-(children exclaiming)
-Ha! Now that's a mural!

375
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,694
It's so passionate.
It almost leaps off the wall.

376
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,404
Oh.

377
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,693
That felon could've torched
the whole school--

378
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,857
were it not stuffed with asbestos.

379
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,276
We'll catch Crowley.

380
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:21,744
And then he'll learn the fine art
of police brutality.

381
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,044
Psst! Marge, over here.

382
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:35,473
Oh, Jack. You threw it all away
over a stupid feud with Skinner.

383
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,969
Look, I'll admit I hate Skinner.
But I didn't start that fire.

384
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,683
-Then why are you hiding?
-Come on, Marge.

385
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,604
With my rap sheet, they can't wait
to send me back to prison.

386
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,734
And you can't believe
the foul language in that place.

387
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,401
So you really didn't do it?

388
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,610
Marge, look in my eyes.

389
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,202
I swear to you I did not do it.

390
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,741
I believe you, Jack.

391
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,703
Now, let's get you out of here.
Wait for my signal.

392
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,995
Oh, Chief?

393
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,919
I found some evidence that points
to the real arsonist.

394
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,840
-Well, let's see it.
-Not yet. You have to guess what it is.

395
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,341
We don't have time
for guessing games!

396
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,553
Nah, let's try it.
It might be fun.

397
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,434
-Is it D.N.A?
-(groans coyly)

398
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,560
So it's like D.N.A.
Um, a hatchet?

399
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,639
You had a turn. I want to guess.

400
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,734
-(clicks tongue) Oh, geez.
-(gasps) My car!

401
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,151
(cackling)

402
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,487
Puma Pride! Puma Pride!

403
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,318
(cackling)

404
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,873
Catch the fever, Skinner!
(cackling)

405
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,792
You crumb bum!

406
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,632
You looked me right in the eye
and lied to me!

407
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,998
Marge, this is the God's truth.
I burned the mural.

408
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,127
But I did not burn Skinner's car.

409
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,174
I just saw you!

410
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,298
-Get him outta here, Chief!
-Yes, ma'am.

411
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,182
My wife and I like watching
that <i>Oz </i>show on HBO.

412
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,636
Uh, i-- is prison really like that?

413
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,106
-Wouldn't know. We only get basic cable.
-Ouch.

414
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,648
Yeah, I also like that <i>Sex in the City.</i>
Huh!

415
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,402
None of those girls look like my wife.
(laughing)

416
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,566
-<i>Sports Center's </i>not bad.
-Yeah. I never got that show.

417
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:26,406
-What's to get? They just tell the scores.
-Yeah, I suppose. Yeah.

418
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:30,373
Hey, you ever meet any mob guys?
Are they really like <i>The Sopranos?</i>

419
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,165
-I told you. We just get basic cable.
-Oh, right, right, right, right.

420
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,671
Listen, if I'm getting too chatty,
just, uh-- just tell me to shut up.

421
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,884
CROWLEY: Nah, I'm enjoyin'it.

422
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,974
Hey, you ever watch them
strong-man contests?

423
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,799
They're pretty good.
Those guys look strong.

424
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,724
{\an8}A lot of guys in prison say they're gay,
but I don't know. They look strong to me.

425
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,970
(theme music playing)

426
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,885
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

427
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,932
