1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,144
Happy Parade Day!

2
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,314
It's the Parade Day Parade!

3
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,484
Clear the roadway!

4
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,654
Your antics
inconvenience hundreds!

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,524
Hooray for parades!

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,059
Your antics delight one and all!

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,163
Follow me, Little Lord Ralph!

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,501
What's hiding
behind the Great Green Wall?

9
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,003
A choo choo? Some buttons?

10
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,005
A dog ten feet tall?

11
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,616
My eyes told me a secret!

12
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,453
Aw, last day of school.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,456
Lot of fond memories in here.

14
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,859
- Furnace.
- On it.

15
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,069
I know
what's behind the Big Hedge,

16
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,337
because I went behind
the Big Hedge

17
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,801
and I saw what's behind
the Big Hedge

18
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,998
and now I'm gonna tell you.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,401
The Big Hedge?
As in the Big Hedge?

20
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,803
No one knows
what's behind that thing.

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,239
Although,
a seventh grader once told me

22
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,408
it was naked ladies
setting off fireworks.

23
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,911
I heard it's where divorced
parents go to get back together.

24
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:22,015
No, sir! It's where they hold
the Independent Spirit Awards!

25
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,751
If you call that independent.

26
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,255
No, it's the best
playground ever!

27
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,925
There's Easter eggs and
baby cars that anyone can drive.

28
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,595
And this many clowns
in clown pants!

29
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,931
Dang, that's hella clowns.

30
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,134
How the crotch

31
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,936
do we get through that thing?

32
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,838
I've seen my dad do this.

33
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,853
See? Easter eggs,
clown pants and baby cars.

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,322
I love you, clowns!

35
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,126
There's a golf course
in the middle of Springfield?

36
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,562
What's golf?

37
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,998
I've never seen a golf course
anywhere,

38
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,899
except those commercials
for pills

39
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,068
that give old people
their life back.

40
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,503
Duckies!

41
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,006
I'm gonna go steal
their wet bread.

42
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,909
Whoa, I've never seen
Jimbo looking so sharp.

43
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,911
Is he bullying rich guys now?

44
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,247
Fine round today, sir.

45
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,850
You know,
I hope to be a doctor myself.

46
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,686
It's always been my dream
to work around blood.

47
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,057
Well, maybe this will help
with medical school.

48
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,762
20 bucks!

49
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,541
What the hell, Jimbo?
You just suck up to that guy

50
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,767
and he gives you money?

51
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,268
It's not sucking up.

52
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,937
Rich guys love hearing
how great they are,

53
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,806
and they're willing to pay
for it.

54
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,775
Money pay.

55
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,578
Look away, pervs!

56
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,082
We'd like jobs, please.

57
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,452
Well, you seem a little young,
but I do need the help.

58
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,487
I'm out several
of my best caddies

59
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,790
due to an elaborate
virginity‐losing wager.

60
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,025
Here are your first assignments.

61
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,063
You know, I've never really
sucked up to anyone before.

62
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,298
Sure, I've lied,
scammed, grifted,

63
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,267
but this feels different.

64
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,401
Special.

65
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,603
Well, I'm a Van Houten.

66
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,972
Watch and learn.

67
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,576
Dang! Looks like I got
the handsomest golfer

68
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,578
in the whole damn club!

69
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,416
You fine, boy!

70
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,418
You're new.

71
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,421
That's why they
assigned me to you.

72
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,423
The best way to learn the course

73
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,258
is by watching
a master carve it up

74
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,160
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

75
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,864
That does sound

76
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,132
like something they would say.

77
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,601
Let's play some golf.

78
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,306
Wait till my friends hear
I caddied

79
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,875
for Kent "The Straight Dope"
Brockman.

80
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,877
We watch you every night.

81
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,947
Really? I thought youngsters got
their news from the internet.

82
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,784
No way. My boys think
broadcast news is the swagness.

83
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,220
And the girls call you
a snack.

84
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,555
Hope it's okay for me
to use the current lingo.

85
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,557
The snack will allow it.

86
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,327
Stacy and I, well, it's...

87
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,394
it's complicated.

88
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,996
Isn't it always?

89
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,766
She's a terrific person
and a top‐notch meteorologist.

90
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,735
But if I'm dodging her calls
after three months...

91
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,071
I think you've
already made up your mind.

92
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,074
You just don't want to admit it,
'cause you're a kind person.

93
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,309
Guilty as charged.

94
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,579
You da man!

95
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,582
Muzzle your nonsense, imbecile!

96
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,184
Said da man!

97
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,819
This is "The Straight Dope",

98
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,854
thanking you
for a wonderful round.

99
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,756
This is it.
The moment of truth.

100
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,324
Did I kiss enough butt?

101
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,593
Only money will tell.

102
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,197
I thought
all money was the same.

103
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,699
But the best money
is peeled off a wad.

104
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,035
<i>Cash rules
everything around me</i>

105
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,279
<i>C.R.E.A.M., get the money</i>

106
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,305
<i>Dollar dollar bill, y'all</i>

107
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,240
<i>Cash rules
everything around me</i>

108
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,584
<i>C.R.E.A.M., get the money</i>

109
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,644
<i>Dollar dollar bill, y'all</i>

110
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,479
<i>Cash rules
everything around me</i>

111
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,947
<i>C.R.E.A.M., get the money</i>

112
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,782
<i>Dollar dollar bill, y'all</i>

113
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,617
<i>Cash rules
everything around me</i>

114
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,953
<i>C.R.E.A.M., get the money</i>

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,856
There's my number one son.

116
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,192
Come sit next
to your proud papa, workin' man.

117
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,861
We're all proud of you.

118
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,395
I'm sure Bart will learn a lot

119
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,265
carrying a bag of sticks
from place to place.

120
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,201
They're called golf bats, Lis.

121
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,203
Nice starter wad.

122
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,706
You want to see
what I'm rolling with?

123
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,876
That rubber band
is just straining!

124
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:43,943
Can I hold it?

125
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,378
Hey, be careful with that!

126
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,949
No‐static dryer sheets?

127
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,218
You pad your wad?

128
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,722
I'm not the father
you thought you married!

129
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,060
Look, Maggie.

130
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,163
Your brother is doing a job.

131
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,697
Aren't you proud of him?

132
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,366
Aren't you?

133
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,967
Want to sneak a peek?

134
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:13,339
And in the end,
everyone lost money but me.

135
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,742
I've learned so much today,

136
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,345
about golf, life and oil leases.

137
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,582
I wish I had tribal land
for you to build a pipeline on.

138
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,286
I'd be honored if you'd frack
under my house someday, sir.

139
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,825
I've never seen my son...
suck up before.

140
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,695
Easy money.

141
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,032
You don't kiss all the golfers'
butts like that, do you?

142
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,268
Oh, Mom. These rich guys
expect a little...

143
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,038
in exchange for some...

144
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,372
It's no big deal.

145
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,375
On one hand,
I'm glad you're being polite.

146
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,777
On the other hand...

147
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,049
Wow, I never thought of it
that way, Mom.

148
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,885
No one looks out for me
the way you do.

149
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,820
You are the shining star

150
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,323
that guides this family
through the darkness.

151
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,758
Oh, aren't you sweet.

152
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,595
Why don't we stop by the
skateboard store on the way home

153
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,829
and I'll buy you...

154
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,098
Suck‐up.

155
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,240
So, there we are
on the 18th green.

156
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,175
The course has been a bear
all morning.

157
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,277
I tell Judge Snyder
to shut that all out

158
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,778
and just be in the moment.

159
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,014
He nods, plants his feet.

160
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,183
And, in one smooth motion...

161
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,086
tips me 50 bucks!

162
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,189
Wow. Just... wow.

163
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,125
Why do I suddenly want
to bring Bart's car around?

164
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,764
Here you go.
Buy yourself a bigger tip jar.

165
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,769
<i>Tip's in the jar,
grateful we are</i>

166
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,971
<i>Praised be your name,
you've raised the game</i>

167
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,773
<i>Some give us zip,
it's such a rip</i>

168
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,808
<i>Shame them with song,
they're in the wrong</i>

169
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,319
<i>All of the grown‐ups
in here just...</i>

170
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,645
Doesn't it bother you

171
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,313
that Bart made that money...

172
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,982
sucking up
to those golfers?

173
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,184
Marge, sucking up
is the American way.

174
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,986
In this country,
everybody got together

175
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,155
and decided that all the money
should belong

176
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,191
to a few dozen families
and their favorite suck‐ups.

177
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,662
Don't you remember
when we all decided that?

178
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,030
And of all the things

179
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,799
that Bart might do for money,

180
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,934
this is by far the most legal.

181
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,036
Other people are paying our son.

182
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,371
And in cash!

183
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,374
It's both aboveboard
and under the table.

184
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,543
That's the dream!

185
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,879
Homie, I know it's not logical,

186
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,047
but when I saw Bart
at that golf course,

187
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,084
my mothering spirit
just wanted to hurl.

188
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,219
Back me up on this one.

189
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,622
Tell our son he has to quit.

190
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,891
Quit being a caddy? No way!

191
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,893
How much did Mom give you
to tell me that?

192
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,228
Nothing.

193
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,663
Well, I can do better than that.

194
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,899
Will 20 bucks make this go away?

195
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,568
Well, I guess I can tell her
I did my best.

196
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,905
Tell her you did your...
very best.

197
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,508
Now that you got your own pool,

198
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,677
what are you gonna buy next?

199
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,121
I'm thinking
of getting one of those booths

200
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,513
that blows money around.

201
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,682
It pays for itself
the first time you get in it.

202
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,117
Bart, no!

203
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,185
That wad is your future.

204
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,188
What you need is
a good investment vehicle.

205
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,529
Patented Ultra‐Freedom
BadAss Technology

206
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,699
stops the engine if the driver
puts on a helmet.

207
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,800
- Yes!
- Yeah!

208
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,202
After you buy it,
can we have rides?

209
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,872
Guys, guys,
if I shared my death‐mobile,

210
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,708
then you wouldn't be motivated
to earn wads of your own.

211
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,543
I'm doing this for you.

212
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,780
Yeah, well,
you're acting like a butt wad.

213
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,582
Oh, Nelson.

214
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,451
Saying what you really think
will get you nowhere.

215
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,962
Lousy rich kids.

216
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,430
- If I had a quad, I'd share my quad.
- Lame.

217
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,564
Okay, okay, I'll tell you
what's bothering me.

218
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,232
It's Bart's caddy job.

219
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,601
It's gross, right?

220
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,102
You can tell me it's gross.

221
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,337
You think it's gross?

222
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,340
Well, private golf clubs
are pretty evil.

223
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,975
Right. They are.

224
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,376
How so?

225
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,746
Wow, look at all these.

226
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,748
Waste of water resources,

227
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,983
pesticide use,

228
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,151
history of sexism and racism...

229
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,920
And Bart's a suck‐up!

230
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,755
Not to mention
that private clubs

231
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,758
get huge breaks
on their property taxes,

232
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,526
which is completely unfair.

233
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,762
Why shouldn't rich people pay
their share?

234
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,264
Lisa, we've got
to shut down that club.

235
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,667
We're going to city hall!

236
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,720
Club President Bildorf.

237
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,455
Plays every single day

238
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,958
and never tips less
than 100 bucks.

239
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,094
Looks like I picked
the right summer job.

240
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,997
Mark my words,
his bag will be on my shoulder

241
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,899
before this year's Father‐Son

242
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,069
Bingo‐Bango‐Bongo
Best‐Ball Scramble.

243
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,613
You know,
since school's not in session,

244
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,639
I can finally tell you...

245
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,307
you're awesome.

246
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,812
I'll take Simpson.

247
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,751
I just won't play.

248
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,523
Okay, Mom. You got
to get your voice out there.

249
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,525
Take the cause
directly to the people

250
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,827
with an online petition.

251
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,930
I got this!

252
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,733
There.

253
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,002
Now all I need is
a catchy title.

254
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,069
I got it.

255
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,738
Stop Coddling

256
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:48,307
the Springfield Junipers
Wealthy.

257
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,975
Whoops, too long.

258
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,411
How about Stop Coddling

259
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,979
the S.J.W.s.

260
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,481
And post.

261
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:58,250
I wonder if that headline
will get any attention.

262
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,654
An online petition attacking
our local private golf club

263
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,356
has garnered
over one million signatures.

264
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,592
One million?

265
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,260
Mom,

266
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,096
you used the term S.J.W.

267
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,231
Yes, I know.

268
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,199
The Springfield Junipers Wealthy.

269
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:18,604
No! S.J.W. stands for
social justice warriors.

270
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,006
That's what right‐wing trolls
call anyone who cares

271
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,841
about positive social change.

272
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,010
Look at the other
online petitions

273
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,279
your supporters have backed.

274
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,782
Oh, boy.

275
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:33,052
A signature's a signature?

276
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:34,496
Thanks to the cranky clicks
collected

277
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,288
by local complainer
Marge Simpson,

278
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,057
Springfield's golf club
will have to pay

279
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,858
a huge property tax increase,

280
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,127
threatening the club's very existence.

281
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,330
In one reporter's
unbiased opinion,

282
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,300
closing this par‐72 landmark
would be a travesty.

283
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,735
One and all would mourn the loss

284
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,971
of this exclusive
private green space

285
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,340
and Ramon's famous Bloody Marys.

286
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,909
He uses a golf tee
as an olive skewer.

287
00:12:57,876 --> 00:12:59,478
I think it's Ramon.

288
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,413
I finally found something
I'm good at,

289
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,515
and you want to ruin it!

290
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,127
You don't know what it's like to
bring something into this world,

291
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:09,421
watch it grow and worry about it
day and night.

292
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,190
I love you, Wad.

293
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:13,492
We're going shopping
for rubber bands.

294
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,861
You deserve it!

295
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,931
Simpson,
report to the first tee.

296
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,033
You're going to the show.

297
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,267
Yes!

298
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,006
Digitaria sanguinalis.

299
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,875
Tell Tetsuo he's fired.

300
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,044
I think it's Tetsuo.

301
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,447
Mr. Club President?

302
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,182
I'm sorry, for a second there,

303
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,685
I mistook you
for a young Pierce Brosnan.

304
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,786
Very young.

305
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,556
Spare me, kid.
I've heard it all.

306
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,961
Simpson, your mother's campaign
is going to bankrupt this club.

307
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,397
I need you to convince her
to call it off.

308
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,798
Oh, I am trying.

309
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,401
My mom never backs down,
no matter how wrong she is.

310
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,571
That's why
she's still married to my dad!

311
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,908
Why are charities
and churches

312
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,412
the only ones
that don't have to pay taxes?

313
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,614
It's preposterous.

314
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,950
Yeah, man, this place
is better than any church.

315
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,952
Everyone wants
to come here on Sunday,

316
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,021
people are always shouting out
the Lord's name

317
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,656
and, instead of wafers and wine,

318
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,260
you get club sandwiches
and scotch in a plastic cup!

319
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:22,594
Bart Simpson,

320
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,997
you've just given me
the greatest idea

321
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,600
since little whales embroidered
on khakis.

322
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,206
As of today, the sport of golf

323
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,308
is officially declared
a religion.

324
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,110
The Springfield Junipers
Golf Club

325
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,212
is now a house of worship.

326
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,649
Like all religions, golf
will be completely tax‐exempt,

327
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,717
adhering to the core American credo

328
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,886
that churches rake it in
but pay nothing.

329
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,322
May Golf have mercy on us all.

330
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,706
Get in the hole!

331
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,343
Thank you for coming,
Your Holinesses.

332
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,878
Once you see how these golfers

333
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,714
are cheapening
the whole idea of religion,

334
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,950
you'll put an end to this sham.

335
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:21,587
You want me to cast judgment
on a faith other than my own?

336
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:23,689
Well, twist my arm.

337
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,626
<i>I'm alright, Lordy, Lordy</i>

338
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,362
<i>Don't nobody worry 'bout me,
don't worry</i>

339
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,464
<i>You got to gimme a fight</i>

340
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,600
<i>Why don't you
just let me be?</i>

341
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,767
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

342
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,371
Congregants, scripture, prayer...

343
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,040
looks like a house of worship
to me.

344
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,544
These aren't commandments.

345
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,212
They're jokes I don't get.

346
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,948
Well, there's plenty of saints.

347
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:52,551
Blessed Shark,

348
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,220
deliver my son's golf ball
safely

349
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,323
onto the green
of Pebble Beach's notorious

350
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,627
and evil 17th hole.

351
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,565
Look at this! It's like
the high holidays every day.

352
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,933
I should be so lucky.

353
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,434
Marge, I'm sorry,

354
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,170
but I think this religion
checks all the boxes.

355
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,573
We're calling it.
It's a faith.

356
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,413
I just can't take
seeing him like this.

357
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,415
Honey, over the years
I've learned

358
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,084
that you just want me
to listen to your problems

359
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,753
and not always try
to solve them.

360
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,621
So... good luck.

361
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,861
It's Sunday.
Shouldn't you be in church?

362
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:37,195
I mean, your church.

363
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,965
I've said a lot to you
about this job,

364
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,867
except what's deepest
in my heart.

365
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:45,037
Honey, the thing I've
always admired most about you

366
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:48,206
is that you've never needed
anyone else's approval.

367
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,275
And I'm worried
you're gonna lose that.

368
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,244
I'm not gonna suck up forever.

369
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,879
Just until I'm rich.

370
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:56,548
Then other people
will suck up to me.

371
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,384
Promise me these golf people
won't take away

372
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,086
my special little guy,

373
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,989
because they seem to get
everything else they want.

374
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,199
Ready to play, sir?

375
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,776
I see you've got
a new diamond earring.

376
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,302
Very age‐appropriate.

377
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,238
Bart, you'll never caddy
for me again.

378
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,541
Now that your mother's
no longer a threat,

379
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,876
I can go back
to Chadlington here.

380
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,480
Him?! But my religion idea
saved the club!

381
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,981
I should be your caddy.

382
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,116
I earned it!

383
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:32,450
Earned?

384
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:35,554
Earning things is so...

385
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,555
tennis.

386
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,224
Golf is about privilege.

387
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,893
Fine. But someday
I'm gonna be a member here,

388
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,296
and I'm gonna be cool
to the caddies.

389
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,164
You, a member?

390
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,133
Oh, look,

391
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:50,068
you made Chadlington laugh.

392
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,507
Look, there's no path from where
you are to where I am.

393
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,476
Once a suck‐up,
always a suck‐up.

394
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,187
Well, I earned this.

395
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,757
Sorry, buddy,
but it's time to say goodbye.

396
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,027
Fore!

397
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:17,395
You joined?

398
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:18,663
They gave us a group deal.

399
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,699
And they lifted
their restrictions.

400
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:21,866
What's not to like?

401
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,535
Everything's not to like!

402
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,136
These people are horrible.

403
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:27,772
Their stupid shoes
clack‐clack‐clack everywhere.

404
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,142
The snack shop buffalo wings
are microwaved and...

405
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:34,045
What the...?

406
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,661
You made one mistake, Bildorf!

407
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,297
You forgot about the wad.

408
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,232
It can buy a pretty nice ATV

409
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,302
or rent a whole bunch of them!

410
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:01,538
Booyah!

411
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:02,874
Oh, no.

412
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,345
Kid power!

413
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,351
Look at me!

414
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,687
I'm playing golf!

415
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:21,126
Rum‐Ta‐Tum, your time has come!

416
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,033
Class warfare!

417
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:33,972
Bart Simpson,

418
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,516
the next time
you want to make a point...

419
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,611
I would prefer
you use your words.

420
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,948
Did you honestly think a little
vandalism would shut us down?

421
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,117
Greens can be reseeded,

422
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:49,554
traps re‐sanded,
roughs unsmoothed.

423
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,056
The club will go on.

424
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,227
And here are the police
to take you to jail.

425
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,398
This is a raid!
We're closing the club down!

426
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,400
Bildorf, you're under arrest.

427
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,335
Me?

428
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:07,005
But they are the ne'er‐do‐wells.

429
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,341
I am the head
of a legitimate religion.

430
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:11,576
You sure are.

431
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,245
And like every new religion,
sooner or later,

432
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,715
it turns into a sex cult.

433
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:27,692
In your case,
it was really... sooner.

434
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:49,581
<i>I'm alright</i>

435
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:50,949
<i>Nobody worry 'bout me</i>

436
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:53,685
<i>Why you got to
gimme a fight?</i>

437
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,988
<i>Can't you just let it be?</i>

438
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,225
<i>I'm alright</i>

439
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,393
<i>Don't nobody worry 'bout me</i>

440
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,630
<i>- Nobody worry 'bout
- You got to gimme a fight</i>

441
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,299
<i>Why don't you just
let me be?</i>

442
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:11,102
<i>Let me</i>

443
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,739
<i>- I'm alright
- Nobody worry 'bout me</i>

444
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,242
<i>Why you got to
gimme a fight?</i>

445
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:20,812
<i>Can't you just let it be?</i>

446
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,981
<i>I'm alright</i>

447
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:26,684
<i>I'm alright</i>

448
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,586
<i>I'm alright...</i>
