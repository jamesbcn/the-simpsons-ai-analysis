00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:25,977
D'oh!

00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:28,573
(grunts)

4
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:31,571
ANNOUNCER: <i>Welcome
to Super Bowl XLVIII</i>

5
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:35,539
<i>between the Seattle Seahawks
and the Denver Broncos.</i>

6
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,302
<i>The field is a frozen tundra,</i>
(Bart laughing)

7
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:41,538
- <i>imported at great expense
from Alaska.</i> - Hmm?

8
00:00:41,688 --> 00:00:42,888
Hmm?!

9
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:44,340
Huh...?

10
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:45,943
(shrieks)

11
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:47,778
(gasps)

12
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:48,910
Oh!

13
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:50,469
(gasps)

14
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:53,241
(screams)

15
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,058
(screams, jabbers)

16
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:02,501
(screams, jabbers)

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,772
Whoo-hoo.

18
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:06,606
(whimpers)

19
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:08,337
(sobs)

20
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:10,976
(Homer continues
whimpering, sobbing)

21
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:14,753
(electricity buzzes,
Homer screams and whimpers)

22
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:18,683
(Homer screams,
electricity crackles)

23
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:20,921
ANNOUNCER: <i>And the game
comes down to this one play...</i>

24
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,514
- (Homer screaming)
- <i>a final field goal.</i>

25
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:24,750
<i>The kick is up, it hits
the crossbar and...</i>

26
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:25,803
(power humming off)

27
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:26,858
HOMER:
D'oh!

00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,299

then whoops)

Who told you that?

I got an in.

37
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:01,764
The VP of Personnel is

00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:04,657
Ooh, look at you,
Mr. Connected.

39
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,277
I hope it's better than

Yeah, what a rip.

The executive stress ball.

00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:14,621
BURNS' VOICE: <i>One more
squeeze and you're fired.</i>

44
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:16,555
(gasps) Now I feel
more stressed than ever.

45
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:17,955
Gah! (gags)

00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:21,549

49
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:28,788
Ho, ho, humbug.

50
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,972
Santa Claus approaches
to judge and punish.

51
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,303
Wow! A good gift
for once.

52
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:39,746
Oogle Goggles.

53
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,902
Augmented reality glasses.

54
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:44,603
You wear them like eyeglasses,
but inside the lens,

55
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,052
you see information about the
people and places around you.

56
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:50,888
Ooh, finally I'm not a slave
to my stupid human eyeballs.

57
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,852
(gasping in wonder)

58
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:54,839

Ooh!

59
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,209
Whoa.

00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,097
(high-pitched gibbering)

61
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:00,927
(smug chuckling)

62
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:04,223
- Glasses, call Lenny.
- Ooh, I'm getting a call.

63
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,192
Answer call. Hello?

64
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:08,599
Lenny, it's me, Homer.

65
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,713
Hm. I always thought
it was "Simp-sen."

66
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,153
Really? Don't you ever
look up at the sky?

67
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:19,474
(theme song playing)

68
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:22,756
Always wondered
what that was.

69
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:26,261
Sir, I'm concerned about
your sudden generosity.

70
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:29,577
The doctor said to bring you in right
away if you display kindness or warmth.

71
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:33,117
Oh, don't worry. This
Santa still has claws.

72
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:38,516
As of now, each of those nuclear
nitwits is wearing a video camera.

73
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,966
With a direct feed to me.

74
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,742
(gasps) You're
spying on them?

75
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,223
Smithers, how much did this company
lose to office supply theft last year?

76
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,109
$7,043.

77
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,010
Yes, well, no more of that.

78
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:53,747
Thanks to this $26 million
surveillance system.

79
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:57,675
Beware, rabbits. I spy
with my transplanted eyes.

80
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:00,401
Oh, and I forgot to show
you the best feature.

81
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:03,982
Each of these buttons
represents an employee.

82
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:07,498
When I press it,
he or she dies.

83
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:13,085
(scoffs) What's wrong
with this thing?

84
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:14,394
(grunts in frustration)

85
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,289
Now, remember kids, the school says
you must have a valentine card

86
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:42,242
for everyone in your class.

87
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,583
How does this mean anything when
everyone's forced to do it?

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,940
What did I say about pointing out
the meaninglessness of things?

89
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:51,011
Not to.

90
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:53,123
Well, no way I'm giving
a valentine to Nelson.

91
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:55,330
He's a bully, and I
do not love him.

92
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:57,717
Jesus says to love
your enemies.

93
00:04:57,737 --> 00:04:59,955
That's because Jesus
knows one day,

94
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:02,727
he gets to look his enemies
in the eye and say

95
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:06,080
"It was me who
sent you to Hell."

96
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:08,825
Bart, your school requires
you to give everyone

97
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,990
a valentine card in an
envelope with a fun sticker.

98
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,214
Your teacher put out
an e-mail alert.

99
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:17,871
With a video attachment.

100
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:21,288
MAN:
<i>Welcome to Firstline. Tonight,</i>

101
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:24,262
<i>"Valentine's Day:
Always A Massacre."</i>

102
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:26,539
<i>At this school, children
may give valentines</i>

103
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:28,086
<i>to whomever they choose.</i>

104
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:29,535
<i>Danny is unpopular,</i>

105
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:33,588
<i>due to rumors he sleeps in the
raw with his ma and his pa.</i>

106
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,974
<i>Human young are born with the
ability to count valentines,</i>

107
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,873
<i>and Danny realizes
he's been snubbed.</i>

108
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:43,455
Past generations of children
were used to rejection.

109
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,718
But today's kids, raised in
a climate of video games

110
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:49,478
and instant messaging,
are fragile weirdos.

111
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:51,924
LYMAN:
<i>On February 15, 2:00am,</i>

112
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,712
<i>after checking the
mailbox one last time,</i>

113
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:57,242
<i>Danny nearly died
from an overdose</i>

114
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,995
<i>of little candy hearts.</i>

115
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:05,585
<i>Many of history's monsters
never received a valentine.</i>

116
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,899
<i>Attila the Hun, Mao Tse-tung,</i>

117
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:09,789
<i>and me, Will Lyman.</i>

118
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:11,284
<i>This is Firstline.</i>

119
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,773
Fine, Nelson gets
a valentine.

120
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,825
An old one from the box.

121
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:22,106
Perfect. Bad movie, bad
pun, even bad paper stock.

122
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:25,984
<i>(Homer laughing)</i>

123
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:27,420
(giggles)

124
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,506
What's so funny?

125
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:31,144
I'm watching videos of
idiots wearing these glasses

126
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,569
and not paying attention
to the world around them.

127
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:35,762
Look at these jerks.

128
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:37,714
(man screams)

129
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:42,544
Ow!

130
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:44,966
(man screams)

131
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:53,848
I don't understand what's
so great about these

132
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:56,864
state of the art,
solar-powered, computo-glasses.

133
00:06:56,898 --> 00:07:01,188
I'll let you try them on, right after I
decide if these videos are Funny Or Die.

134
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:04,689
Funny, funny, die, die,

135
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:06,771
funny, funny but
the guy died.

136
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:07,918
Oh.

137
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:12,738
Now, a simple Sunday drive will reveal
the hidden wonders of our hometown.

138
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:17,477
Hmm...

139
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,504
(grunting with effort)

140
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:25,782
Whoo-hoo!

141
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:29,402
D'oh!

142
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:34,217
Springfield City Hall was built for the
Spencer Tracy movie <i>Meet Me At City Hall.</i>

143
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:37,868
It was just a flat wall with
nothing behind it for 30 years.

144
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,439
Dad, Bart's on my
side of the seat.

145
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:42,981
Dad, Lisa's my little sister.

146
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:44,857
(both grunting)

147
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:48,873
The rearview mirror was invented
in 1911, for just this reason.

148
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:51,435
Interesting. When was the
term "shut up" invented?

149
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:54,511
As early as 1859, shut up
was used to shut up...

150
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:57,253
Homie, I think the kids
are just hungry.

151
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,643
Glasses, direct me to the
nicest restaurant I can afford.

152
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,296
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
<i>Accessing soup kitchens.</i>

153
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:05,303
What, you... Oh, that's
it, I'm taking you off.

154
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,882
Aah! Reality.

155
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:08,624
JEREMY:
<i>Oh! Sorry, sir!</i>

156
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:12,886
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

157
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:20,636
Ugh, oh! Ooh.

158
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:22,502
Eh.

159
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,931
- Oh.
- (Homer giggles)

160
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:31,975
HOMER:
Mm-hmm. Squeeze here.

161
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,619
Rotate there.

162
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:35,015
Pause for sweet talk.

163
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,436
Oh, glasses, you're
so wonderful.

164
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:41,189
Huh? A-Are you using your
glasses for snuggling?

165
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,877
But the avatar looks
just like you.

166
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:48,273
I'm afraid wives don't make passes
at husbands in those glasses.

167
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:51,931
Glasses, find me a great
gift for my wife.

168
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:53,718
(whispers):
Under five dollars.

169
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:54,955
MARGE:
I heard that!

170
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:57,535
Glasses, take me two
minutes back in time.

171
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,261
Oh... (grumbles)

172
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,075
- Marge.
- Mm.

173
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,027
- About the glasses.
- Mm!

174
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,687
- I'm really sorry, and...
- Mm, mm, mm.

175
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:14,078
Here's your breakfast.

176
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,190
Only five pancakes?

177
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:20,570
- You're trying to kill me.
- Well, I'm not happy with you.

178
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:24,466
Look, honey, I know these glasses
are a radical new technology

179
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:26,452
and should be worn
in moderation.

180
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,806
Isn't that right, glasses?

181
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,881
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
<i>Yes, just like I told you.</i>

182
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,734
Anyway, I'm giving them up.

183
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:35,533
To whoever dares take them.

184
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:42,134
(Lisa and Bart gasp)

185
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:44,110
Yoink.

186
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,766
Aw, come on, Mom.

187
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,145
For once, I'm
grabbing the goody.

188
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,112
So the rumors are true.

189
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,356
Moms <i>can</i> want things.

190
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:56,205
Hmm.

191
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:02,448
Hmm...

192
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:04,156
Nicely done, Lewis.

193
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:08,293
A Transformer that
transforms into a heart?

194
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,114
I love it!

195
00:10:14,194 --> 00:10:16,560
Mm. This Hershey's
Kiss is melted.

196
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,856
Not good.

197
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,932
My mom left it on
the dashboard!

198
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,672
My mom...!

199
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,921
I'll have yours now, Simpson.

200
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,798
In Ga'hoole, we would
break his frickin' knees.

201
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,108
No. No Valentine
for you, Nelson.

202
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:38,790
Excuse me?

203
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:42,039
I'll give a Valentine to a loser,
I'll give a Valentine to a dork,

204
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,070
I'll even give a
Valentine to a girl,

205
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:47,209
but I won't give a
Valentine to a bully!

206
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:50,413
Here's what's gonna happen.

207
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:54,000
You have one week to make me the
best Valentine any kid ever got.

208
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:55,701
And what if I don't?

209
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,389
Simpson, there's gonna be
a heart in my hand,

210
00:10:58,402 --> 00:11:00,826
either paper or yours.

211
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:05,564
- Hey, everybody.
- That's strange.

212
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,806
I-I'm hearing a voice, but
I'm not seeing a user icon.

213
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,423
Carl, it's me.
I'm here.

214
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:12,949
Really here!

215
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:14,880
Hey, Homer. A lot of
information about you.

216
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,372
Let me just page through it.
Oh! Stop! Hey! What?

217
00:11:18,392 --> 00:11:21,985
Oh, no one can live in a
non-augmented reality.

218
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,009
I need another
pair of glasses.

219
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:27,191
Charlie, your move
in Muppet Chess.

220
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:29,027
Gonzo to Fozzie Seven.

221
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,968
Aw! That's Kermit-mate.

222
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:32,313
Wocka wocka!

223
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,607
Oh, why is it the recipe
card you need is always

224
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,752
the one Homer writes
his cocktail ideas on?

225
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:42,734
Maybe these bleep-bloop
glasses can help.

226
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,331
Okay, Marge Simpson
entering the Matrix,

227
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:48,759
for a brownie recipe.

228
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:51,037
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
<i>Here are my top-rated recipes.</i>

229
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:55,234
Ooh. So many choices, Maggie.

230
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,518
(beeping)

231
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:04,148
HOMER:
Um, Mr. Burns, sir?

232
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:06,724
Can I get another
pair of glasses?

233
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,192
Maybe two pair? One
for the beach house?

234
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:11,843
Can I also get a beach house?
<i>Two</i> beach houses.

235
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,746
Huh? Monitors?!

236
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:16,054
What the...?

237
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:20,507
Burns gave us those glasses
so he could spy on us!

238
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,614
This is a violation
of our human rights.

239
00:12:23,637 --> 00:12:26,938
Okay, so let's see what we can see.
(cracks knuckles)

240
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:31,246
Solitaire, top hats on eBay,
Angry Birds fan fiction,

241
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:35,410
guy doing really easy crossword puzzle,
Lenny doing Carl's clown makeup...

242
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:37,454
someone's actually working?

243
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:39,255
Maggie?!

244
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,405
Who's Mommy's little girl?

245
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:44,139
Genealogy.org says <i>you</i> are!

246
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:45,453
You are!

247
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:46,706
(Maggie giggles)

248
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:48,829
(chuckles):
Aw...

249
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:51,739
Wait a minute. Since Marge
is wearing my glasses,

250
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:53,998
I can see everything
she sees!

251
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,047
Uh-uh, I shouldn't
watch this.

252
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:57,742
MARGE:
Such a good baby.

253
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,558
You deserve some ice cream.

254
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:02,936
Wait a minute... Marge said
we were out of ice cream.

255
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,982
(Marge humming happily)

256
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,192
Ooh!

257
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:07,847
(Marge chuckles)

258
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,553
(gasps)

259
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:10,478
Oh!

260
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,238
What else is Marge
hiding from me?

261
00:13:13,313 --> 00:13:14,146
(doorbell rings)

262
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:16,344
MARGE: Maggie, he's here!

263
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:18,818
Oh, is she having an affair?

264
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:22,032
Thanks for asking
me to lunch.

265
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:25,097
Oh, why isn't she
having an affair?!

266
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:30,721
What about a Valentine that
says: "Bully, for you"?

267
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:33,045
Hmm, interesting.

268
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,640
"Interesting" means "no."

269
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:37,151
"Interesting" means "no."

270
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:38,389
(snaps fingers)

271
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:42,184
- Milhouse, you're a genius!
- I am? What did I say?

272
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,929
(groans):
Oh, nothing.

273
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:46,662
On TV when a guy
says something lame,

274
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,520
another guy says he's a genius,
and then he has an idea.

275
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,063
I thought it might
work for me.

276
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:53,365
Well, you called me a genius.

277
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:54,992
That means a lot.

278
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,712
Oh, I hate this
stupid holiday!

279
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:59,938
The only thing you
can do is screw it up.

280
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:00,738
(gasps)

281
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:03,189
That's it! Bart,
you're a genius!

282
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:07,018
Well, if you keep throwing the
word around, it means nothing.

283
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:12,001
- Who are you?
- Mr. Burns!

284
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:15,583
Oh. I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.
I won't bother you again.

285
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:24,688
HOMER: <i>Marge, that's a
"Compact Only" space.</i>

286
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:26,864
(Marge grunts)

287
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:30,359
(chuckles): Well... who
knew <i>you</i> were such a rebel?

288
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,858
Now let's learn more about
my wife's secret life.

289
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:36,588
Secrets which can
only be good.

290
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:41,368
Hi, Marge. Dr. Carlock
is ready for you.

291
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:42,626
MARGE:
Thank you.

292
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,208
So, Marge, how have you been?

293
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:48,126
MARGE (sighs):
Okay, I guess.

294
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,019
Marge is in therapy?!

295
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:52,201
MARGE:
Oh, I hate when I come here

296
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,934
and the first word out
of my mouth is "Homer."

297
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,080
But here we go, again.

298
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:57,855
(sighs)

299
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,833
Homer was converting our
dollars to "yu-ros."

300
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,356
Not the money, the sandwich.

301
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,312
And has there been any
improvement in Homer's drinking?

302
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,077
MARGE: Well, he's down 
to two beers in the shower.

303
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:15,305
They're pale ales! Please!

304
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,781
Well, maybe if you just concentrate
on one problem, like his temper.

305
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:21,817
MARGE: Oh, everything in the
newspaper makes him mad.

306
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:24,478
Not <i>Marmaduke!</i>
Never <i>Marmaduke!</i>

307
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,684
<i>Marmaduke</i> was horrible today!

308
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:31,156
Also, Marge is in therapy,
and she didn't even tell me.

309
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:35,249
Whoa. She has crossed a line.
How did you find out?

310
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:37,561
Spied on her with
a hidden camera.

311
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:41,637
She thinks I'm selfish. She thinks I
don't spend enough time with the kids.

312
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:43,418
Well, that's crazy.
Come on.

313
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:45,788
You work your butt off in
a radioactive hellhole,

314
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:48,446
and what do you get? Not
one lousy superpower.

315
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,571
I guess the only choice
is to come clean with her

316
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,747
and tell her what I
know, and <i>how</i> I know.

317
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,426
Whoa, whoa! Bad idea. No, no.

318
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:58,394
Chicks do not like finding
out they're being spied on.

319
00:15:58,411 --> 00:16:05,945
I speak from loooooong...

320
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,085
experience.

321
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:10,373
No, you got to make it seem like
you found out by accident there.

322
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,670
Um... ooh!

323
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:15,390
Next week <i>you</i> schedule an appointment
with the therapist after hers,

324
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:18,236
and then you bump into Midge
in the waiting room there.

325
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:20,209
Moe, that's great!

326
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:21,999
(chuckles):
How do you get your ideas?

327
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:24,181
Pretty much all my friends
are divorced guys.

328
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:28,026
Hello, Homie!

329
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:29,295
Dinner's almost ready.

330
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:32,489
Pork chops with my
secret seasoning.

331
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:36,111
Yeah, you <i>do</i> like your
secrets, don't you, Marge?

332
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:38,402
Don't lose your cool, Homer.

333
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:41,584
The building block of a
marriage is <i>long</i> silence.

334
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,508
Hey, where'd she go?

335
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,498
Good, good, you held
your tongue there.

336
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,271
Because... hey,
where'd <i>you</i> go?

337
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,565
Doesn't anybody want
me to give 'em advice?

338
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,802
Okay there, Fido, when you
see that squirrel outside,

339
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:56,335
at first you play it
cool, you understand?

340
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:57,323
(barks twice)

341
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,439
"I fear you"?

342
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,834
This is what Valentine's
Day means to you?!

343
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,803
This is what it means
to everyone.

344
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,593
How can you be forced
to say "I love you"?

345
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:10,940
People only give Valentines
because they're scared

346
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:13,583
of what would happen
if they didn't.

347
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:16,653
"Nelson, you frighten me so,

348
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:19,151
"The psycho-est bully I know,

349
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:22,600
"You're a sociopath
in need of a bath,

350
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:25,650
I'm sure you'll wind
up on death row."

351
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,327
(sniffing)

352
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:31,728
Mmm! You can really
smell the fear on this.

353
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,358
I rubbed it on Milhouse.

354
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:36,339
Simpson, you just touched
my heart's butt.

355
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,168
Why are you hugging yourself?

356
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:40,195
Why are you hugging
yourself?!

357
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:43,439
If Nelson doesn't do something
bully-ish in two seconds,

358
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:44,902
I'm gonna wedgie him.

359
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,217
Nelson doesn't
wear underwear.

360
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,792
Wow. Always
one step ahead.

361
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:54,618
Uh, I'm here to check
in for the 3:00.

362
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:57,339
Please fill out these
forms, Mr. Fakinami.

363
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,777
No, it's "Fake Name."
I'll just call you Elias.

364
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:02,419
That's "Alias."

365
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,190
Duh. Hm!

366
00:18:13,378 --> 00:18:14,185
HOMER:
<i>Finally.</i>

367
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,320
<i>Time for the big bump-into.</i>

368
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:19,284
Same time next week, Marge?

369
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:21,052
Oh, absolutely.

370
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:23,386
These sessions keep
me on an even keel.

371
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:27,236
Dr. Carlock is like my
Wednesday reset button.

372
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,594
HOMER:

No need. Everything's fine.

Oh, I forgot to
tell you, Homie,

391
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:36,993
I bumped into Helen Lovejoy
today, and guess what?

392
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:40,645
I don't need to know, Marge. You
deserve to have your secrets.

393
00:19:40,674 --> 00:19:42,907
It's not a secret.
It's a funny story.

394
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:45,556
Okay, Marge, but
first, well...

395
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:47,870
I have something
I need to tell you.

396
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:51,434
Something I did you might be
mad about, and rightly so.

397
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,992
Oh, I bet my story's
more interesting.

398
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,452
Whoo-hoo! I tried!

399
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:56,398
- Okay.
- Okay,

400
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:58,293
so, Helen Lovejoy
told me that

401
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:01,551
she made her famous snickerdoodle
Bundt cake for the church sale,

402
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:04,298
and she put in salt
instead of sugar!

403
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:05,404
(laughs)

404
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,849
Yeah? And...?

405
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:08,859
That's it. That
was the story.

406
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:11,109
- Where's that cake now?
- It got sold.

407
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,977
- Who bought it?
- Dr. Hibbert.

408
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:16,363
- Excuse me. I have to make a call.
- Don't take too long.

409
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,864
Okay, Hibbert's in surgery,
but they're having him paged.

410
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,561
(both moaning passionately)

411
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,696
HOMER:
Wait, something's wrong.

412
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,696
(grunts)

413
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:26,881
That's better.

414
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:28,933
Oh, dear God.

415
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:37,026
Hi, Ralph. Um, I just
wanted to tell you,

416
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:39,987
there was a tooth in the
Valentine you gave me.

417
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:42,884
Plant it and you'll
grow a new Ralph.

418
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:45,714
I don't need a new Ralph.
I like the old one.

419
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:47,423
Happy Valentine's Day.

420
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:50,123
Well, better get ready
for St. Patrick's!
