And we're backstage rapping

58
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,443
Fellas, I'm gonna hit you with
a phrase that has dogged you

59
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,902
throughout your career--

60
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,612
"Washed up."

61
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,032
Yet here you are, among the top
105 concert acts today.

62
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,412
What's your secret, guys?

63
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,778
Well, after
the Berlin Wall fell,

64
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,276
our records started selling

65
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,077
on the dismal side
of the Iron Curtain,

66
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,161
and naturally that gave
us a boost.

67
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,706
We're very big in Bulgaria,
and what's-his-name?

68
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,749
The other Garia.

69
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,292
-Hungaria?
-Yeah, whatever.

70
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,535
I can't think of anyone
who's benefitted

71
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,798
more from the death
of Communism than us.

72
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,800
Maybe the people who actually
live in the communist countries.

73
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,092
Oh yeah, I hadn't thought of that.
I bet you're right.

74
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,137
On the other hand, each of us just
bought our own soccer team.

75
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,062
How many Hungarios
can say that, eh?

76
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,680
Test... test...

77
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,605
Gee, I'm sorry, man.

78
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,608
Huh?

79
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,229
About the Frisbee.

80
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,776
Frisbee?

81
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,189
Say, guys,
I wonder if you'd mind

82
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,817
recording a couple
of promos for us?

83
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,034
Like what?

84
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,663
Maybe you could say

85
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,200
"Nobody rocks like
Bill and Marty on KBBL."

86
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,834
We don't know that,
do we?

87
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,201
What if somebody rocks
as good as you?

88
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,617
Or better. I mean...

89
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,245
We don't want to look stupid.

90
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,922
Okay, we can respect that.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,880
How about,
"Rock-a-doodle-doo!

92
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,211
You're listening
to Bill and Marty"?

93
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,045
-Yeah, sure.
-That's good, yeah.

94
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,840
(chanting)
Tap! Tap! Tap!

95
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,755
I just looked out there,
and there's puddles of water

96
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,433
all over
the freakin' stage.

97
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,062
Well, I don't want
to lie to you boys.

98
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,929
Six days a week the place
is a hockey rink.

99
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,976

That's only four miles
from my house!

123
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,406
And we thought they knew
how to rock in Shelbyville.

125
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,735

00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,353
Well, it seems
some silly twit

130
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,809
did not get a
big enough oxygen pump,

131
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,890
but that's supposed
to be a devil.

132
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,805
Filled up with air,
it's very evil and impressive.

133
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:40,355
We salute you,

138
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,995
You know, people think there are
only five members of Spinal Tap,

139
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,290
but they are wrong.

140
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,794
(coughing)

141
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,916
Could we turn up
the house lights, please?

142
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,423
That was the cue to turn up
the house lights

143
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,045
so we can tell
the audience

144
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,222
they're the sixth member
of the freakin' group!

145
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,010
We are trying
to put a tiny thrill

146

147
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,011
Oh, forget it.

148
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,347

Show's over.

151

Good night, Springden.

152
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,113
There will be no encores.

(confused, angry chattering)

154
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,818
They were only on

00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,458
<i>at the premiere of Mozart's</i>
The Magic Flute.

179
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,790
<i>So, what's the answer--</i>
<i>ban all music?</i>

180
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,336
<i>In this reporter's opinion,</i>
<i>the answer, sadly is yes.</i>

181
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,461
BART:
Hi, Mom.

182
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,467
Oh...

183
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,589
Oh, thank God.

184
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,885
Mom, I want to be a rock star.

185
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,889
Mm... we'll discuss it later.

186
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,601
Is Milhouse okay?

187
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,942
Uh... I'll be right back.

188
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,098
(door slams)

189
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,846
(tires screeching)

190
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,318
Help! Help!

191
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,952
(humming)

192
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,702
Homer, I've been thinking
about what Bart said.

193
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,035
If he's really interested
in being a musician

194
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,910
maybe we should
buy him a guitar.

195
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,957
That's a waste of money.
We already have a guitar.

196
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,341
(playing
"Pop Goes the Weasel")

197
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,259
I meant a real guitar.

198
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,508
This is real.

199
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,509
(hollow plastic knocking)

200
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,761
Wow!

201
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,643
And it came with
a free instruction book.

202
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,391
Now boy, we spent
a lot of money

203
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,143
so you'd better get real good,
real fast, or pow!

204
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,726
Homer!

205
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,151
Hey, I thought I was
supposed to encourage him?

206
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,520
(heavy metal guitar playing)

207
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,107
(Cockney accent)
I'd like to play me latest chart topper.

208
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,402
It's called

209
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,945
"Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs."

210
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,291
(groaning)

211
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,538
Bart, you've
got to go on.

212
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,659
Slag off.

213
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,365
You've changed, man.

214
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,785
You used to be about the music.

215
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,924
I said slag off!

216
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,169
Cool!

217
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,177
(playing sour notes)

218
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,929
(skillfully playing
the blues)

219
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,643
-Knock it off.
-I'm sorry.

220
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,683
(playing sour notes)

221
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,146
(skillfully playing
the blues)

222
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,148
Knock it off!

223
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,520
I's just jammin'
with ya.

224
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,688
(playing sour notes)

225
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,357
Hey, Simpson what are
you trying to play?

226
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,027
"Polly-Wolly Doodle."

227
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,365
Oh, yeah? Well, it sounds
Polly-Wolly crappy.

228
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,702
Ha-ha!

229
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,656
Burn.

230
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,075
Hey, cherry ax,
Bart dude.

231
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,876
I think it's broken.

232
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,749
Oh, really? Give it here.

233
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,716
(playing heavy metal licks
like a pro)

234
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,681
(cheering)

235
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,846
I didn't know you played
the guitar, Otto man.

236
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,225
Hey, that's all I did
in high school.

237
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,613
My old man said
I was wasting my time

238
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,150
and I'd never amount
to anything.

239
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,573
(laughing)

240
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,533
I, uh... hmm.

241
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,493
Now I'd like to slow
things down a little bit.

Although I'm sure

248
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,628
I will receive a severe wedgie
from my bus mates,

249
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,177
I must remind you

250
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,060
we should have been at school
ten minutes ago... Ah!!

251
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,178
Uh-oh. Better fasten
your seat belts, little dudes.

252
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,596
We don't have seat belts.

00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,945
Good show last night.

258
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,871
Yeah, quite good.

259
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,280

00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,377
Good Lord! Did anyone
get the license number?

262
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,383
-Gee, I forgot.
-I don't think so.

263
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:00,505

264
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,177
-Yay!
-Whee!

265
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,518
It's a miracle
no one was hurt.

266
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,193
I stand on my record--

267
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,022
15 crashes and not
a single fatality.

268
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:16,028
Let's see
your license, pal.

269
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,490
No can do.
Never got one.

270
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,031
But, if you need proof
of my identity,

271
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,914
I wrote my name
on my underwear.

272
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,161
Oh, wait--
these aren't mine.

273
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,663
Well that tears it.

274
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,115
Until you get a license
and wear your own underwear,

275
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,115
mister, you are
suspended without pay.

276
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,577
Who's gonna drive the bus?

277
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,877
I drove an all-terrain
vehicle in Da Nang.

278
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,841
I think I can handle it.

279
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,011
Where's Otto?

280
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,931
Otto?

281
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,890
That's one palindrome you
won't be hearing for a while.

282
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,930

283
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,563

00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,290
Uh... that would be
cutting it a little close.

294
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,503
I think you have to be
more aggressive, sir.

295
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,214
Nonsense.

296
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,674
One of our good citizens
will slow down and wave me in.

301
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,934
What's so funny?

302
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,767
I was just thinking
about the time

303
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,062
Homer caught his nose
in the toaster.

304
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,106
We'll watch
the tape tonight.

305
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,780
Oh look, you got someone
at your window.

306
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,318
My name's Patty.

307
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,111
I'll be testing you.

308
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,605
When you do good,
I use the green pen.

309
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,197
When you do bad,
I use the red pen.

310
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,703
Any questions?

311
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,325
Yeah, one: have you
always been a chick?

312
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,332
I don't want to offend you,

313
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,334
but you were born a man,
weren't you?

314
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,336
You can tell me.
I'm open-minded.

315
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,548
I won't be needing this.

316
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,771
All right! Yeah!

317
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,229
So, how did I do?

318
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,388
Well, you failed every segment

319
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,857
and misspelled "bus"
on your application.

320
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,148
Drag.

321
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,282

Hey, landlord,
some clown changed my locks

327
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,256
padlocked the door,
and put up an eviction notice.

328
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,298
Yeah. That was me.

329
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,342
You?

330
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,795
Well, uh... why?

331
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,925
Because you haven't paid
your rent.

332
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,812
Can I at least
get my stuff?

333
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,099
All I found in there
was a jar of mustard

334
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,732
and a couple
of old Cycle magazines.

335
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,150
Wow! I had mustard?

336
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,729
Rough day, Apu.

337
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,324
Pump me a Squishee
and don't spare the syrup.

338
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,860
Perhaps you'd like to try an experimental
flavor of my own concoction--

339
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,405
a delicious
chutney Squishee.

340
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,369
Uh... okay.

341
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,040
You can really taste
the chutney.

342
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,416

You're living
in a dumpster?

346
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,169
Oh, man, I wish.

347
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,426
Dumpster brand trash bins
are top-of-the-line.

348
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,469
This is just a Trash-co
waste disposal unit.

349
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,064
Otto, why don't you
come home with me?

350
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,719
You can stay in our garage.

351
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,387
A garage!

352
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,646
Somebody up there likes me.

358
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,249
Whoo!

359
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,511
Hey.

360
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,392
Bart, what's going on?

361
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,299
Mom, I thought
you might forget

362
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,308
our little conversation
this afternoon,

363
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,850
so I took the precaution
of recording it.

364
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,894
What conversation?

365
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,648
BART: <i>Mom, can Otto live in our</i>
<i>garage for as long as he wants?</i>

366
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,110
<i>(Bart imitating Marge)</i>
<i>He sure can.</i>

367
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,030
Marge, what
were you thinking?

368
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,489
That's not my voice.

369
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,028
Oh, everybody says that

370
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,322
when they hear
themselves on tape.

371
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,026
I don't understand this.

372
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,077
Why can't you stay
with your parents?

373
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,120
The admiral and I
don't get along.

374
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,334
Please, let me stay here.
I've got nowhere else to go.

375
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,706
Forget it-- that line
didn't work for my Dad

376
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,423
and it's not gonna
work for you.

377
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,383
Dad, Otto's going through
a real tough time.

378
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,093
Can't he stay with us
for a while?

379
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,434
I know we didn't ask
for this, Homer,

380
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,969
but doesn't the Bible say

381
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,392
"whatsoever you do
to the least of my brothers

382
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,391
that you do unto me"?

383
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,393
Yes, but doesn't
the Bible also say

384
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,765
"Thou shalt not take...
moochers into thy... hut"?

385
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,274
Please, Dad?

386
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,645
If you let Otto stay,

387
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,112
he'll help around the house

388
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,991
and chip in a few bucks
whenever he can.

389
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,398
All right, he can stay.

390
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,446
But I get to treat him
like garbage.

391
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,321
Wow, what's the catch?

392
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,538
<i>The can of corn costs... 57¢!</i>

393
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,948
(bell rings)

394
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,707
I could sure go
for a can of corn.

395
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,329
Otto you can't just sit
there watching TV all day.

396
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,377
You know,
you're right.

397
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,550
I should do
a little reading.

398
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,548
Uh, you got any of those
"Where's Waldo" books?

399
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,881
-No.
-How about anything written

400
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,677
-from the vampire's point of view?
-No.

401
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,511
How about anything
where guys

402
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,006
send in naked pictures
of their chicks?

403
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,927
Otto, I think you
should get a job.

404
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,596
Look, the only thing
I was ever good at

405
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,314
was driving a bus

406
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,024
and now "the man" says
I need a piece of paper to do that.

407
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,895
So get that piece of paper.

408
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,152
I tried!

409
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,903
Oh, Lord, how I did try.

410
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,486
(sighs)

411
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,241
(playing riffs)

412
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,493
Will you knock it off!

413
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,284
I can't hear myself think.

414
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,787
(Otto stops playing)

415
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,789
<i>I want some peanuts.</i>

416
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,370
That's better.

417
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,075
Hey, how come you never play
your guitar anymore?

418
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,786
I'll tell you
the truth. Dad.

419
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,746
I wasn't good at it
right away, so I quit.

420
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,666
I hope you're not mad.

421
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,665
Son, come here.

422
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,667
(laughs)

423
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,428
Of course I'm not mad.

424
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,601
If something's hard to do,
then it's not worth doing.

425
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,430
You just stick that guitar
in the closet

426
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,597
next to your shortwave radio

427
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,805
your karate outfit,
and your unicycle

428
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,936
and we'll go inside
and watch TV.

429
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,153
-What's on?
-It doesn't matter.

430
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,445
-(pounding)
-Open up! Open up!

431
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,359
I got to go,
and no fooling.

432
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,697
Hey, pop-n-fresh!

433
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,452
You're supposed
to giggle.

434
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,414
(growls)

435
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,333
(cries out)

436
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,086
That guy has got to go.

437
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,918
I know how you feel.

438
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,884
But he is good
with the kids.

439
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,099
So the lady drove faster,
but the strange car

440
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,758
kept banging into her
from behind.

441
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,927
(gasps)

442
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,354
So, finally,
she swerved off the road

443
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,563
into the woods

444
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,273
and lost the other car

445
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,193
and that's when she realized

446
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,022
the man in the other car
wasn't trying to hurt her.

447
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,778
No-- he was trying
to warn her...

448
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,611
about the ax-wielding maniac
hiding in her back seat!

449
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,118
Did the maniac kill her?

450
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,910
Natch. You know how I know?

451
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,004
How?

452
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,828
Because...

453
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,043
I was that maniac.

454
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,044
(Lisa screaming)

455
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,586
Hey, I was just kidding.

456
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,460
That's it.
He's out of here.

457
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,587
But Homer, we're the only
family he's got.

458
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,264
I don't care.

459
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,432
This is not Happy Days,
and he is not The Fonz.

460
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,971
Hey-y-y, Mr. S.

461
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,934
Listen, you drain-clogging,
last-cookie-eating,

462
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,846
collect-call-getting sponge.

463
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,944
I want you out of my house.

464
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,480
-Heavy.
-What are you gonna do, Otto?

465
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,074
Oh, don't worry.

466
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,609
There's plenty
of money out there

467
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,402
for a guy who knows
how to fake his own death.

468
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,026
Well, before you do that,

469
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,703
maybe you should take
the driving test again.

470
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,702
I can't pass that thing.

471
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,544
I got a zero last time.

472
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,750
This time I'm hungover.

473
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,999
You can do it, Otto.

474
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,290
You're the coolest adult
I ever met.

475
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,004
Wow. I've never been called
an adult before.

476
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,796
I've been tried as one, but...

477
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,261
I'll do it.

478
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:22,261
"Alcohol increases
your ability to drive."

479
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,386
False?!

480
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,392
Oh, man!

481
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,894
I don't know about this,
Bart dude.

482
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,437
Your Dad is right.

483
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,480
I am a bum.

484
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,653
He didn't call you a bum.

485
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,901
He called you a sponge.

486
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,822
Sponge?

487
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,441
(grunting)

488
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,317
Does this look like something
a sponge would do?!

489
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:44,075
I'll show him who's a sponge.

490
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,579
Well, if it isn't
Wee Willy Washout.

491
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,333
I want to take
the test again.

492
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,374
Why?

493
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,747
So I can staple
my license

494
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,963
to Homer Simpson's
big bald head!

495
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,464
Really? Well, here's
your written test.

496
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,917
I'll get you started.

497
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,177
"B," "C," "D,"
"A," "B..."

498
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,516
Homer had a piece of food
on his face for three days.

499
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,808
(laughing)

500
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,642
It wasn't little either.

501
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,687
It was a chicken wing.

502
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,980
(hysterically)
Wing!

503
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,524
Ooh, what was that?

504
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,357
It doesn't matter.
Let's get some margaritas.

505
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,572
I'm buying.

506
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,409
Otto!

507
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,122
That's what
