00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,550
In order to buy them, the school board had

17
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,842
to eliminate geography.

{\an8}Ooh! No time for brain teasers.

{\an8}That's right, I do.

{\an8}I--I know you do. Baby.

42
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,191
Otto, since when
have you had a girlfriend?

{\an8}Oh, Otto, of course my answer is--

Yes, I will marry you.

00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,062

{\an8}Ooh, and such delicate tissue paper.

{\an8}Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

69
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,076
{\an8}No knife games on the kitchen table.

70
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,120
{\an8}I didn't hit your precious table.

00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:10,714
{\an8}Ooh, we're "cordially invited,
this Saturday

72
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:15,132
{\an8}to join Otto and Becky
at 742 Evergreen Terrace."

That's our address.

74
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,549
I told Otto he could have
the wedding here.

75
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,593
-Hope that's OK.
-You should have asked first, Bart.

76
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,218
Weddings are hard work

77
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,354
and cost thousands of dollars.

78
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,061
Hey, it'll be easy. You've
still got most of the stuff

79
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,351
-from Apu's wedding back there.

All right, Otto can get married here

82
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,857
but, Homer, you have
to get rid of that elephant.

83

Let's see. Candles, flowers,
place cards, rice...

86
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,745
Oh, Mom, you're not supposed
to throw rice anymore.

87
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,251
Birds eat it, their stomachs swell,
and they explode.

88
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,673
Why am I just learning this now?

91
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,549
Son, your mother and I
don't approve of this marriage

92
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,474
as we've not approved
of any part of your life to date.

93
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,644
Well, the important thing is you came.

94
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,853
We're leaving.

95
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,273
Drive safe!

96
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,561
(grunts) Always a bridesmaid.

97
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,645
Only occasionally a bride.

98
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,361
Lisa, it's time you learned
the truth about men.

99
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,702
-They're pigs?
-The bitterness is strong in this one.

100
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,948
(both cackling)

101
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,204
So, any words for the bride and groom?

102
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,334
Not now, Bart.

103
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,700
I'm trying to urinate.

104
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,456
You don't seem to be trying very hard.

105
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,206
(humming)

106
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,463
Dad, the bride and groom are supposed

107
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,795
to cut the wedding cake.

108
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,760
Oh, that's just superstition.

109
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,340
Thank you.

114
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,867
Oh, Becky, you look beautiful.

115
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,831
{\an8}I thought you might want
to see this bridal magazine.

116
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,711
It's got 900 tips

All "don'ts."

118
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,498
Oh, we'll be fine.

119
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,883
Otto's got a clean police record,

120
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,749
and he doesn't do any needle drugs.

121
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,376
{\an8}Well, the real key, according to sexperts,

122
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,054
{\an8}is mutual interests.

123
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,182
No prob. We like all the same things.

124
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,390
-Except...
-Mm-hmm?

125
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,971
Don't tell Otto, but I'm not

126
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,136
into heavy metal, and he loves it.

127
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,225
He refers to our lovemaking
as the headbanger's ball.

128
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,861
Oh, you can fix little defects
like that with gentle nagging.

129
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,110
Make it part of the background
noise of your relationship.

130
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,323
That's how I polished Homer
into the perfect-- Homer!

131
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,525
No! That's ice!

132
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,775

133
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,616
(humming)

134
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,196
And now... (clears throat)

135
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,867
as for the matter of my honorarium.

136
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,627
-What?
-You know, my emolument.

137
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,129
-Huh?
-Pay me. Three hundred dollars.

138
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,672
Three hundred?
I could have gotten Rick Dees for that.

139

You got Poison to play at our wedding?

144

We're Cyanide, a loving tribute to Poison.

145
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,895
We need a ride home!

146
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,657
You expect me to walk down the aisle

147
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,198
to a monster ballad?

148
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,490
Let me talk to Otto.

149
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,907
Oh, that's OK.

150
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,155
I guess this is sort of...

151
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,501
(sniffs) ...our song.

152
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,462
Well, it doesn't have to be.

153
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,502
Otto's just going to have to decide

154
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,626
what's more important,

155
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,167
his heavy metal or you.

156
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,426
(playing "Nothing but a Good Time")

157
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,433
Becky, what have I done here?

158
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,393
I'm so sorry.

159
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,394
In about 15 minutes,

160
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,686
I'd take off that wedding dress

161
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,359
or you're going to look crazy.

162
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,979
(sobs)

163
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,236
Moe, can I give you
some shrimp for the road?

164
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,572
Nah, I'll just take the ring pillow...

165
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,827
and these, uh, seven presents I brung.

166
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,831
Ah, you know what?
Cram some shrimp in, too.

167
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,206
Head to tail. That way you can fit more.

168
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,299
How about some sauce?

169
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,798
(mumbles) Thanks.

170
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,628
Becky, I know you must feel awful,

171
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,137
but at least this didn't happen
after you were married.

172
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,260
Yes, better now than when you're too old

173
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,137
and fat to get another man.

174
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,104
(sobs)

175
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,893
I feel so alone.

176
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:39,936
What am I going to do?

177
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,899
Hey, why don't you stay with us?

178
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,109
Bart, remember that talk we had

179
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,070
about you volunteering our house?

180
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,690
Remember that talk we had

181
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,737
about you not wrecking people's weddings?

182
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,410
(grumbling)

183
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,199
It's settled. The stranger stays with us.

184
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,163
HOMER, LISA AND BART: Yay!

185
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,621
HOMER: <i>♪ Cha-cha-cha-changes ♪</i>

186
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,254
<i>♪ Time to change the oi-l ♪</i>

187
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,253
<i>♪ Changes ♪</i>

188
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,376
<i>♪ Don't wanna be an oily man ♪</i>

189
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,841
A man innocently changes his oil when...

190
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,882
a two-ton car comes crashing down.

191
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,087
<i>♪ But it won't change oil... ♪</i>

192
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,967
Crashing down.

193
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,434
{\an8}(grunts)

194
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,934
Oh!

195
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,515
Who'd have thought you could hold up a car

196
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,060
with a wicker basket?

197
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,900
Now, Lisa's going through this phase

198
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,441
where she doesn't eat any meat.

199
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,904
So, I usually sneak a little

200
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,784
meat juice into her vegetables.

201
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,450
Wow, you're a real life Martha Stewart.

202
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,320
I mean, without the evil.

203
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,117
May I?

204
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,120
Mmm! Yummers.

205
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,412
Nobody's ever called
my gravy yummers before!

206
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,997
Mmm! You know what would be
really nuts? A little rosemary.

207
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,844
Ooh, ooh! I've always wanted
to use rosemary in something.

208
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,511
(slurping and smacking)

209
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,090
Mmm.

210
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,224
Mmm! Mom, this gravy

211
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,722
tastes better than God's sweat.

212
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,893
Thanks to our own spice girl, Becky.

213
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,023
Well, Mom, you really brought out

214
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,020
the mung in these beans.

215
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,312
Actually, that was Becky, too.

216
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,436
What are these things
in the mashed potatoes?

217
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,483
That's the skins. I left them on.

218
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,897
Well, nobody's perfect.
Let me just pick those out.

219
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,776
No! Oh, Becky.

220
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,573
Your potatoes are the best I've ever had.

221
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,777
Oh, God.

222
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,830
Hey! Hey! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!

223
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,252
-Hey! Hah! Hah!
-Stop kicking my baby!

224
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,043
Ah, it's cool. We're just
putting some Jackie Chan moves

225
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,667
into Bart's video project.

226
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,464
Yeah, Mom, I need something great.

227
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,177
Milhouse has footage of himself
falling down the stairs.

228
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,348
Well, no kicking. It's too dangerous.

229
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,598
Marge, chill out! I have great control.

230
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,220
See? Hah! Hah!

231
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,057
That's very impressive,
but I still don't...

232
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,733
Stop that!

233
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,691
Hey! Hey!

234
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,901
(saxophone playing)

235
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,900
(grunting)

236
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,652
(grunting continues)

237
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,565
MARGE: Well, hello!

238
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,201
We're jamming, Mom.

239
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,912
She's painting my music,

240
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,082
and I'm playing to her painting.

241
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,411
Isn't it wonderful to have

242
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,326
a hip female influence in the house?

243
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,884
Yes. Well, I guess I'll go roll socks.

244
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,129
It's not hip, but it has to be done.

245
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,462
Actually, you could just
tie them at the ends.

246
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,417
That way, the elastic doesn't wear out.

247
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,048
Yes, I hate when things get worn out.

248
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,055
Mmm. Socks, welcomes...

249
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,653
She's so helpful, and everyone loves her.

250
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,479
And well, this may sound crazy,

251
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,855
but I think my family
likes Becky more than me.

252
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,743
(laughs nervously)

253
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,070
-I wouldn't worry about that.
-Really?

254
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,025
Yeah, you're going to be dead
in a week, anyway.

255
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,656
Dead in a week?
What are you talking about?

256
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,213
Look, honey, never let an attractive woman
into your house.

257
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,618
All they ever do is usurp your family

258
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,708
and then kill you.

259
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,132
Like that documentary,

260
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,590
<i>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.</i>

261
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,710
That was a movie.

262
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,836
Look, all we know

263
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,053
is she's going to shoot you

264
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,553
or stab you or boil you.

265
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,434
Or club you with an antique wooden doll.

266
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,971
(chuckling) Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that was a good one.

267
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,845
Oh, but first, she's going
to seduce your husband.

268
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,063
Becky's going to seduce Homer?

269
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,854
-Ugh...
-Ugh...

270
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,437
It's an act of violence, not love.

271
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,146
(snores)

272
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,695
(groaning softly)

273
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:18,778
(door creaks)

274
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,163
(gasps)

275
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,945
(gasps)

276
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,292
Oh, I'm sorry, did I wake you?

277
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,581
I wanted to return your hair dryer.

278
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:30,997
(gun cocks)

279
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,383
(whimpers)

280
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,300
Oh, and here's your brush.

281
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,918
(mumbles incoherently)

282
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,005
You just enjoy
your grocery shopping, Marge.

283
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,010
And if you pick up some Semolina,

284
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,842
I can make couscous for Lisa.

285
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,637
Ah! It's my favorite!

286
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,641
-It is?
-Oh, yeah.

287
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,023
You can learn a lot from your kids

288
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,059
if you just listen to them.

289
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,352
(giggles)

290
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,685
(groans)

291
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,055
Be right back.

292
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,862
Take your time!

293
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,413
Why do I always think
of the perfect thing to say

294
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,081
when it's too late?

295
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,909
Shut up, Becky!

296
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,834
Oh, that would have been sweet.

297
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,671
(gasps) No?

298
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,051
-(buzzing)
-MARGE: The brakes cut light!

299
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,167
(horn honking)

300
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,926
-(tires screeching)
-MARGE: It's red!

301
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,050
-(grunting)
-Uh!

302
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,847
-Ooh!
-Wow. Tough glass.

303
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,768
(shutter clicks)

304
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,350
I still say ours is bigger.

305
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,015
(screaming)

306
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,114
Our speed bumps are stronger, too.

307
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,651
CLANCY: I don't know, Simpson.

308
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,954
How do I know you didn't cut
your own brakes?

309
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,658
Why would I do that?

310
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,368
I don't know, get some attention

311
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,948
from a handsome police officer?

312
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,493
That's crazy!

313
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,536
(sighs)

314
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,539
Look, I know I don't have any proof,

315
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,871
but this woman is trying to kill me.

316
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,377
Ah, fine.

317
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,628
Let me tell you what I tell everybody

318
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,879
who comes in here.

319
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,841
The law is powerless to help you.

320
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,721
Do I have to be dead
before you'll help me?

321
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,429
Well, not dead, dying.

322
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,219
No, no, no, don't walk away.

323
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,512
Wait, how about this,
just show me the knife.

324
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,346
In your back. Not too deep,

325
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,521
but it should be able to stand by itself.

326
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,062
Come on, Becky, tell us your big news.

327
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,605
Well, I wanted to wait
for your mother, but OK.

328
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,530
I found an apartment, and I'm moving out.

329
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,938
-Oh, no!
-HOMER AND BART: Oh!

330
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,986
Becky, I think I speak
for all of us when I say...

331
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,742
when's the ice cream going to get here?

332
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,735
-(thunder crashes)
-(both gasp)

333
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,446
And god said gather ye

334
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,326
two of every flavor,

335
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,173
anoint them with 62 sauces,

336
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,959
whipped cream, and nuts,

337
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,342
and ye shall call it

338
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,130
"The Ark."

339
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,473
Oh, oh... (panting)

340
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,930
(gagging)

341
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,720
-Homer!
-Relax, he's gorging.

342
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,306
-OK, maybe not.
-(grunts)

343
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,641
We've got to save him!

344
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,437
(Marge screams)

345
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,232
Usurper! Usurper!

346
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,398
Usurper!

347
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,856
Don't mess with me. I've got jimmies!

348
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,567
(screaming)

349
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,867
I can only see a horrible rainbow.

350
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,451
(glass shattering)

351
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,497
(gasps)

352
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
Shut up, Becky!

353
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,415
There. I finally said it.

354
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,134
(growling)

355
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,132
(screaming)

356
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,338
CLANCY: Drop the cone, sugar.

357
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,507
(gunshot)

358
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,845
Hmm. Whoopsie.

359
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,810
Take her away, boys.

360
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,229
I thought you said the law was powerless.

361
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,401
Powerless to help you, not punish you.

362
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,440
(slurps) Mmm. Earned my treat.

363
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,233
This isn't over, Becky.

364
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,567
I know where you live.

365
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,742
My house!

366
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,076
Poor Maggie. How many insanity hearings

367
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,462
have you been to
in your short little life?

368
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,459
Mrs. Simpson, before we begin,

369
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,591
I just want to assure you
that this is not a trial.

370
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,920
-Oh.
-Aw...

371
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:04,924
All right, it's a trial.

372
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,335
-Yes!
-Yes!

373
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,263
Now, Marge, according to this,

374
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,012
you recently went berserk
in an ice cream parlor.

375
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,215
Yes.

376
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,644
And, Marge, did you ever have

377
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,273
an unhealthy fixation on Ringo Starr?

378
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,981
It was healthy. He reciprocated.

379
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,062
He reciprocated!

380
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,527
(mumbling) Please...

381
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,068
-Please...
-Excuse me, what are you doing?

382
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,372
Oh, I was just praying to God
that you'll find me sane.

383
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:36,078
I see. And this "God,"
is he in this room right now?

384
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,541
Oh, yes, he's kind of everywhere.

385
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,292
-Hmm...
-Mm-mm.

386
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,844
Marge Simpson, you give us no choice

387
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,378
but to declare you utterly...

388
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,381
I'm not insane!

389
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,803
You didn't let me finish.

390
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,011
Insane!

391
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,301
(gasps)

392
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,594
(all gasp)

393
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,927
Oh!

394
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,443
Aah!

395
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,769
I'm not insane.

396
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,605
Run, Marge! Run!

397
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,400
Pump those crazy legs!

398
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,701
{\an8}<i>Police say escaped</i>
<i>mental patient Marge Simpson</i>

399
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,409
{\an8}<i>could be anywhere,</i>

400
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,159
<i>even here at Juggernauts,</i>

401
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,201
<i>where it's wet t-shirt month.</i>

402
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,655
(waitresses cheering)

403
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,495
<i>But for now, this reporter prays</i>

404
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,710
<i>that "Mad Marge" can be captured</i>

405
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,540
<i>before she kills again.</i>

406
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,245
Kills again? She hasn't killed once.

407
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,376
Shouldn't we be out there
trying to find her?

408
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,224
Don't worry, she'll show up here
sooner or later

409
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,840
to finish off Becky.

410
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,676
Then we'll have Mommy back.

411
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,390
Hmm? Hmm? (gasps)

412
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,640
(breathing heavily)

413
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,268
(marching band music playing)

414
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,253
(grunting)

415
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,667
Come back! Those are prescription pants.

416
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,758
Now, Ralphie, what are you going to do

417
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,103
if you see Mrs. Simpson?

418
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,058
Freeze, you crazy mommy!

419
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,808
Attaboy, but you got
to aim a little higher.

420
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,982
There you go. That's a kill shot.

421
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,311
Now, we've got a special guest.

422
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,066
She just flew in from the cuckoo's nest

423
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,569
and boy, is she crazy.

424
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,032
Crazy Marge Simpson!

425
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,953
(laughing) Look at that.

426
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,571
(imitating Marge) Hello, Krusty.

427
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,948
(laughing)

428
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,624
Oh, that's funny.

429
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,252
So, Marge,

430
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,119
who's your favorite
Native American warrior?

431
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,247
Crazy Horse, Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

432
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,545
(blubbering) No, no, no...

433
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,379
All right, all right. Stop it.

434
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,844
Oh, this bit's dying.

435
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,764
Let's go to the Mad Marge dancers.

436
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:59,763
(Russian music plays)

437
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,143
-Too soon.
-Oh, I really miss Mom.

438
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,226
The kids are saying if you say
"Bloody Margie" five times,

439
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,822
she'll appear, but then
she gouges your eyes out.

440
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,278
I hear she mates with men, then eats them.

441
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,947
I'm sure if Marge were here and not crazy,

442
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,159
she'd be telling you two
to do your homework

443
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,870
and you to finish washing the dog.

444
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,490
(flies buzzing)

445
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,247
(panting)

446
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,294
Now, let's find out
who this Becky really is.

447
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,381
(gasps)

448
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,093
(groans)

449
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,931
I really should read the whole headline

450
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,215
before I react.

451
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,152
Oh, my, I've been so unfair to Becky.

452
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,809
Maybe I am insane.

453
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,898
I mean, I am talking to myself.

454
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,823
You are? Oh, I thought I'd made a friend.

455
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,035
Becky, I want to apologize to you--

456
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,409
Usurper!

457
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,340
Hyah!

458
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,926
-Why you little...
-BART: Cut! Cut!

459
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,338
Mom, it's great to have you back,

460
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,796
but you walked right into my shot.

461
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,676
"Shot"? What... what are you...

462
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,433
I hope we didn't scare you, Marge.

463
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,144
Bart's just filming a music
video for his class project.

464
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,226
And I'm directing the "making of" video.

465
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,941
Oh...

466
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,941
Well, then, I guess there's

467
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,522
a reasonable explanation for everything,

468
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,858
except you cutting my brakes.

469
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,695
Oh, about that.
Uh, when I changed your oil,

470
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,281
I may have drained your brake fluid.

471
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,826
I didn't say anything because
I thought you'd be mad.

472
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,790
Oh, boy, my bad.

473
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,580
Becky, I'm so sorry I accused you

474
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,875
of trying to kill me and steal my family.

475
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,669
Hey, no biggie.

476
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,632
I was trying to steal your family.

477
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,712
I even thought of
a good place to bury you.

478
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,758
But then I didn't have a shovel
so I went to the hardware store

479
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,051
and they have six different kinds,

480
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,804
and I was, like, "later."

481
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,846
Well, that's a relief, too,

482
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,680
knowing I'm not crazy.

483
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,265
So, I guess everything
really worked out for the...

484
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,521
-(Homer gasps)
-Mom!

485
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,773
-You monsters! You killed her!
-No, they didn't.

486
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,226
-(gasps)
-Good lord!

487
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,066
We put enough tranquilizers in there

488
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,741
to take down Jonathan Winters.

489
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,700
Oh, I've got too much to do
to take a nap right now.

490
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,992
Lisa, get Maggie out of that cage.

491
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,996
And, Homer, since you're dressed for it,

492
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,868
I got some "S&M" for ya,

493
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,915
scrubbing and mopping.

494
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,749
(laughing)

495
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,254
(groans)

496
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,838
Thank you.

497
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,312
(theme music playing)

498
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,433
-(murmuring)
-Shh.
