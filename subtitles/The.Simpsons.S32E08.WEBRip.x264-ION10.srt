1
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,843
Next item on the agenda.

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,111
Principal Duggins.

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,780
Well, I see that not one
of your students

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,717
was able to meet
the national fitness standards.

5
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,118
A light jog.

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,653
Come on, Duggins.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,922
You got to be a role model
for those lazy kids.

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,025
Tell them you put in
two hours a day stretching...

9
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,861
your lap band.

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,937
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you, Principal Finch.

11
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:40,707
Well, I guess we can cross
hilarious joke off the agenda.

12
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,776
Oh, I've also got
a funny thing.

13
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,879
Duggins' wife was unfaithful.

14
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:51,018
Skinner,
learn how to read a room.

15
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,053
- Sorry, Duggins.
- Screw you.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,723
Indeed. Now, as you all know,
this weekend in Cincinnati

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,893
is the national
administrator's convention,

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,395
or EDU‐CON.

19
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,197
And, well,
I have been invited

20
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,099
to give the keynote address.

21
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,835
Oh, well.

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,737
Yes. Sunday.

23
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,272
Main auditorium.

24
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:16,143
The Proctor & Gamble Room?
Crushed it!

25
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,715
Well, that couldn't
have gone worse.

26
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:22,983
I agree.

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,251
Yes, well, as you all know,

28
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,853
the budget allows
for a plus‐one,

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,789
and I was thinking
I would bring

30
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,992
the principal
with the highest test scores.

31
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,394
- Finch.
- Well, that's not fair.

32
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,964
Finch runs the magnet school
for gifted test takers.

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,766
Sorry, Seymour,
but I have made my decision.

34
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,436
If it makes you feel any better,
you were never in the running.

35
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:46,239
Hey, we are gonna
light Cincinnati up.

36
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,718
I got a buddy who used to be the
long snapper for the Bengals.

37
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,978
He co‐owns
this amazing poké place.

38
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,779
Seaweed, furikake,

39
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,181
soakin' in ponzu!

40
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,184
My God, you're cool.

41
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,689
Okay, this is
for all the marbles.

42
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:08,095
No wonder Chalmers
is taking Finch to Cincinnati.

43
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,596
How'd you hear about that?

44
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,398
It's all over the playground.

45
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,966
<i>Chalmers went to Cincy</i>

46
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,534
<i>Didn't take our princy</i>

47
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,504
<i>How many tears
did Skinner cry?</i>

48
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,007
<i>One, two, three, four, five</i>

49
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,508
Well, as usual,

50
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,977
the double Dutchers
have zeroed in on my pain.

51
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,714
Look, Seymour, are you ready
for some tough love?

52
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,882
Is there any other kind?

53
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,517
Being around you sucks.

54
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,619
No one's ever gonna invite you
to anything.

55
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,421
If there's a party
you want to go to,

56
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,722
you got to crash it,

57
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,457
or you'll spend
the rest of your life

58
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,627
sitting around with your hand
stuck in a pelvis.

59
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,965
It's too late.
The plus‐one has been invoked.

60
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,100
Dude, you're Seymour Skinner.

61
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,536
No matter how badly
you're treated,

62
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:50,713
you keep coming back for more.

63
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,140
That's your superpower.
Use it!

64
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,776
You're right. I will.

65
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,380
Aw, look at you,
grazing the thumb.

66
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,185
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

67
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,221
Finch, where are you?

68
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,823
We're going to miss our flight.

69
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,291
Can't make it, Gary.

70
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,669
I ate some pre‐trip poké
last night,

71
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,494
and it's blitzkrieging
my intestines.

72
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,097
I'm firing salmon eggs
from both ends.

73
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,799
But you're my ride
to the airport.

74
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,501
My car's in the shop
being winterized.

75
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,837
Sorry, dude. Yeah? Cool.

76
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,375
Hop in, sir. We still have time
to make our flight.

77
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,378
Skinner?
What are you doing here?

78
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,547
Well, I saw
on Finch's InstaSnap story

79
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,515
that he's firing salmon eggs
from both ends.

80
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,684
So I rushed over here at once.

81
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,053
You want to come with me
to Cincinnat... No. Thank you.

82
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,789
Very thoughtful, Seymour,
but I wouldn't want to...

83
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,925
You wouldn't want
the school board to find out

84
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,427
you wasted the transferrable
but not refundable

85
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,997
$65 plus‐one registration fee?

86
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,767
No, I would not.

87
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,269
Oh, boy.

88
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,476
Game Night.

89
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,278
Jason Bateman,
your boyish charisma

90
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,981
was made for the low‐res
seatback screen.

91
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,517
Sir, are you all right?

92
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,885
If you must know,

93
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,120
flying makes me
just a little bit nervous.

94
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,655
Where'd you put my carry‐on?

95
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,924
I'm going to pop
an antianxiety pill.

96
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,326
Oh, I gate‐checked your bag.
It's free,

97
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,796
and you don't have to fight
for precious overhead space.

98
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,098
Another classic
Skinner travel hack.

99
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,534
My pills were in that bag,
you idiot!

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,804
You... Okay. Okay.
I can do this.

101
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,540
It's just
a short domestic flight.

102
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,708
I'm completely safe, right?

103
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,777
Sure. And if you're stressed,
you can take comfort

104
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,513
in the passengers'
many emotional support animals.

105
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:43,817
Pig?

106
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,420
I'm going to die
in a flying zoo.

107
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:58,832
Everyone around you
is taking their shoes off.

108
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,769
Okay, no one is safe.
No one's sa...

109
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,038
That phone
is not in airplane mode.

110
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,774
The pilot
dresses like an alcoholic!

111
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,043
Somebody's yelling!
Who is yelling?!

112
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,946
Where in the name of God
is the air marshal?!

113
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,223
You're banned
from Air Cincinnati forever.

114
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,392
Well, we've got to get
another flight.

115
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,094
We can't, sir.

116
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,164
Air Cincinnati's the only
airline that flies to Cincinnati

117
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,666
since the demise
of Cincin‐Air‐Y.

118
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,235
Well, that's just great.
That's great!

119
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,970
In 36 hours, I have to give

120
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,072
the most important speech
of my life.

121
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,574
Now, how in the name
of Satan's jockstrap

122
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,077
am I supposed to get there?

123
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,680
Please, sir.
If you give me one last chance,

124
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,358
I will think of nothing else
but getting you

125
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,684
to that keynote speech on time.

126
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,988
Nah, I'll just drive myself.

127
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,160
All right, where is your car?

128
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,728
It, too, is being winterized.

129
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,730
But I know where to get one.

130
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,366
Oh, no.
You're not borrowing my Buick.

131
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,468
I just had it winterized.

132
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,070
But, Mother,
this road trip is my last chance

133
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,107
to become friends with the man
I admire most in the world.

134
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,241
Please.

135
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,144
Well, you did do such a nice job

136
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,180
re‐beading my eyeglass chain.

137
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:23,883
I guess a boy your age
should have friends.

138
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,658
Ah, you, me
and the open road, huh?

139
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:37,897
Yeah. Maybe some music will make
the time pass more quickly.

140
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,633
<i>Timothy, Timothy...</i>

141
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,703
I hope you like this song,
'cause it's stuck in the player,

142
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,371
and there's no volume knob.

143
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,474
<i>Timothy, Timothy</i>

144
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,912
<i>God, what did we do?</i>

145
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,421
Oh, did you know
that in Cincinnati, they have

146
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,423
four different ways
of preparing chili?

147
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,957
You don't say, huh?

148
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,692
- Four different ways.
- The two‐way...

149
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,903
- Chili with spaghetti.
- How about that.

150
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,529
- Spaghetti?
- The three‐way...

151
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,906
- Chili with spaghetti and cheese.
- Lot of ways.

152
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,298
Please shut up.

153
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,909
- Oh, he's got more.
- And there's two kinds

154
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,377
- of four‐ways.
- I just... I want to die.

155
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,973
Hitchhikers!
Oh, thank the Lord.

156
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,975
Hitchhikers, sir?
Is this safe?

157
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,977
They can bury us
in a shallow grave

158
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,246
as long as they don't talk
about chili.

159
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,483
Thanks for picking us up.
We're on our way to a gig.

160
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,286
Oh, a gig.
Are you musicians?

161
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,854
Oh, no. We do...

162
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,722
Improv Shakespeare!

163
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,558
Improvisers?

164
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,260
In the style of Shakespeare?
That seems impossible.

165
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,729
Methinks this noble lord
doth doubt our wit.

166
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,833
We must perform
or else be deemed unfit!

167
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,636
A word, a word.
My kingdom for a word.

168
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,873
- No, no, don't give them a suggestion.
- Cupholders.

169
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,008
To grasp a cup
would seem a great ordeal.

170
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,545
When one must keep both hands
upon the wheel.

171
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,516
The pentameter checks out.
Your parents must be so proud.

172
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,851
They're not.

173
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,657
Toupee or not toupee,

174
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,959
that is the question.

175
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,695
You are the only ones
having fun!

176
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:16,929
Just you!

177
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,664
Oh, beware the ides of...

178
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,566
Truck!

179
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,613
Well, well, well,
what have we got here?

180
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,615
Don't worry, Officer.

181
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,416
It's minor damage.

182
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,018
Nothing serious.

183
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,856
Alas, poor Buick.
I knew it well.

184
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,766
Dear Lord. Our car,
our wallets, our luggage,

185
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,002
they're all blown to shreds.

186
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,737
But the keynote. Your speech.

187
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,405
It's all on the cards
right here.

188
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,708
But what good will it be
when some backwoods judge

189
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,243
throws the book at us, huh?

190
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,548
All rise for the Honorable
Judge J.T. Winchester.

191
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,018
Who dragged me in here
on a Saturday

192
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,020
in the middle
of my Lifetime movies?

193
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,256
I'm missing my Lifetimes!

194
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,726
An old woman who's enraged
by my very existence.

195
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,562
Don't worry, sir. I got this.

196
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,164
Your Honor,
permission to observe

197
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,701
that your poor cuticles
are raw and torn.

198
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,135
Thanks to my idiot son.

199
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,005
He made my manicure appointment
with Tanya P.

200
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,540
instead of Tanya G.

201
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,743
Oh, well, that boy's
as useless as a shaved frog.

202
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,111
Now, Mother...

203
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,513
Hush up and empty the spittoons,
Fennimore.

204
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:46,151
You know, I always travel

205
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,187
with cuticle scissors
and jojoba oil.

206
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,190
Let's get these ladies ready
for their close‐up.

207
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:55,895
Now, you have fun
at the convention, boys.

208
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,997
You just bring it back whenever.

209
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,067
Mother, you never let me
drive the Cutlass.

210
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,337
My car is for good boys!

211
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,813
<i>Timothy, Timothy</i>

212
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,284
<i>God, what did we do?</i>

213
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,887
Well, we're only a half hour
behind schedule.

214
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,656
Should we brainstorm
on a code

215
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,090
for the hotel room safe?

216
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,927
Seymour, you charmed the Depends
off that lady.

217
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:30,229
I believe I owe you a beer.

218
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:32,665
A biker bar?

219
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:34,166
Are you sure it's safe?

220
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,568
All right, stop quivering
like a quince jelly.

221
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,470
You're with me.

222
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,686
Sir, this isn't a biker bar.

223
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:55,788
It's a cyclist bar.

224
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:56,989
Don't be a ninny, Seymour.

225
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,324
Barkeep!

226
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,392
A beer for me
and my coworker here.

227
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,928
We just serve energy gels
and oxygen.

228
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,130
You don't like it, get out.

229
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,172
You two oil burners
might want to skedaddle

230
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:16,475
before my resting heart rate
elevates to 60 bpm.

231
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,011
That's beats per minute,
oil burner!

232
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:31,657
Why don't you calm down
there, Slim?

233
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,594
What did you call me?

234
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,674
The bike computers!

235
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,576
All our stats were on there!

236
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,611
They hadn't synced yet!

237
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,848
Yeah, but you still got
the exercise, right?

238
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,593
It's as if
the rules of the road

239
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:08,994
don't apply to them.

240
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,730
Are you pedestrians
or vehicles?!

241
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,365
Make a choice!

242
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,433
Never!

243
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,907
Skinner, what do we do?

244
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,376
Seymour! Well, don't go!

245
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,878
Skinner?

246
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,455
Step away
from my superintendent.

247
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,190
What's he gonna do?

248
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,558
He's just one guy.

249
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,562
You're never alone

250
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,932
when you're a veteran
of the U.S. Armed Forces.

251
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,734
And I do mean armed.

252
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:53,305
Para‐athletes like us are the
natural enemy of cycling clubs.

253
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,908
Their biceps are bigger
than my quads!

254
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,177
To the support van!

255
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:06,285
Seymour, how did you...

256
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:08,420
I keep abreast
of local veterans' events.

257
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,056
Luckily, the Wheel Team Six
para‐marathoners

258
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,758
were racing nearby.

259
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,160
Seymour, you have earned this.

260
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,267
You know, there was a time
I would have mocked you

261
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,038
for collecting bed‐and‐breakfast
travel points with your mother,

262
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,307
but, I'll tell ya,
today those points have paid

263
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,609
for this sweet,
thick elderberry wine.

264
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,213
Well, nothing is as sweet
as your kind words.

265
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,202
Oh, yeah. That's good stuff.

266
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:46,892
Ernest, I've never felt
more independent and strong.

267
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,494
Can I use your phone
to call Mother?

268
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,862
There she is.

269
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:53,198
Just make sure no one's using
the upstairs extension.

270
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,200
You're back
in the office already?

271
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,737
Principal Finch,
your gut biome is a wonder.

272
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,773
So, how's Sad Sack Seymour and
the Cincinnati Snooze Cruise?

273
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,409
Yeah, vintage Finch.

274
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,879
But believe it or not,
Skinner has shown,

275
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,881
bursts of utility.

276
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,618
You better not be getting
cold feet, Gary.

277
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:13,785
We made an agreement.

278
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,420
Skinner gets canned,

279
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,891
and I leave my tiny little
magnet school for the big time,

280
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:21,727
Springfield Elementary.

281
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:22,895
I'm pumped!

282
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,296
Yes, I know, I know.

283
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,798
The plan was to fire Skinner,
and...

284
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,802
I am a man of my word.

285
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,738
Fire Skinner?

286
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:34,673
Chalmers!

287
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,941
Oh, dear.

288
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:45,918
Fire me?!

289
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:48,453
You bald‐pated son of a bitch.

290
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,789
I you two gentlemen
could please...

291
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,891
Stay out of this, Trudy!

292
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,794
For years,
this man belittled me.

293
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,197
Humiliated me.

294
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:00,766
And in exchange
for my unwavering loyalty,

295
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:02,301
what was my reward?

296
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:05,737
To be pushed out by
some scheming magnet school...

297
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,873
keister kisser!

298
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,410
The brochures nobody takes!

299
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:14,413
I'm the one who deserved this
trip to Cincinnati, not Finch.

300
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:17,649
That's why I put black mold
in his poké.

301
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,019
You did what?

302
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,589
The Rocking Chair Museum.

303
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:24,756
I've heard good things.

304
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,659
Skinner...!

305
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,695
You know why I was gonna
fire you, Seymour?

306
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:32,664
Because your neediness,
it sucks the life out of me!

307
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,602
After all these years of trying
to spare your feelings,

308
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:38,070
I'm just gonna say it now.

309
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,706
I... don't... like you!

310
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:43,208
<i>And the man in the back said,
everyone attack</i>

311
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,244
<i>And it turned
into a ballroom blitz</i>

312
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,589
<i>And the girl in the corner said,
boy, I wanna warn you</i>

313
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,348
<i>It'll turn
into a ballroom blitz</i>

314
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:51,550
<i>Ballroom blitz</i>

315
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,788
<i>Ballroom blitz</i>

316
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:57,889
<i>Ballroom blitz</i>

317
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,925
Ooh, Terry Bradshaw stayed here.

318
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,693
Not the one you're thinking of.

319
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,779
You know, I'm not gonna give you
the pleasure of firing me,

320
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,438
because I quit!

321
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,009
Good riddance!

322
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,269
Well, well, well.

323
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,638
If it isn't the Cuticle Kid.

324
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,107
You racing to give a mani‐pedi?

325
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,676
Just give me the ticket,
Fennimore.

326
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:55,113
License and my mother's
registration.

327
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:00,519
Superintendent,
you're on in five.

328
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:03,321
Great, great.
I'll just ensure my notecards

329
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:04,823
are in the correct order.

330
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:09,194
Road trip
conversation starters?

331
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,902
We switched jackets.

332
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:18,570
Seymour has my speech!

333
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,338
It's often been said
that one speech

334
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,707
can make or break
a man's career.

335
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,977
Together, we now face
such a moment.

336
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:27,579
Our keynote speaker,

337
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:31,683
Superintendent
Garibaldi Chalmers.

338
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,457
Well, it's an honor
to be here

339
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:40,859
in Cleveland.

340
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,460
It's Cincinnati!

341
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,496
Look at the skyline!

342
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,332
You just... You won't believe
what's happened.

343
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,334
I'm...
Well, maybe you will!

344
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,469
You've all got
that one principal,

345
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:55,273
that one that gets you
into such ridiculous situations,

346
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,243
maybe even on the way here.

347
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,013
Yes. Quite.

348
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,350
This guy, Skinner,
he screws everything up.

349
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,953
He took my jacket and my speech!

350
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:11,890
He left me with the
useless garbage in his pockets.

351
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,793
A mommy manicure kit.

352
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,661
A VFW event calendar.

353
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,463
A B&B rewards card.

354
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,599
Calico Level.

355
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:24,169
And conversation starters
like...

356
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:27,472
How can I make
your job easier?

357
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,075
He sounds like a good guy,
you jackass!

358
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,810
Well, I...

359
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,244
I suppose he is.

360
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:36,081
He's loyal
and resourceful and...

361
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:37,816
Oh, God, help me.

362
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:39,618
I respect Seymour Skinner.

363
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,686
In fact, I like him.

364
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,357
Ditto, Gary.

365
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,763
Aw, Skinner.

366
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,636
I've got something
that belongs to you.

367
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:01,806
Now go give the greatest
keynote speech of your life.

368
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:04,042
Well, maybe I already have, huh?

369
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,778
But if I must.

370
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,947
Educational Infrastructure.

371
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,583
Ability Grouping
versus Blended Learning.

372
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,686
Now, a survey
of public administrators

373
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,323
over a 15‐trimester period
showed clearly,

374
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,026
within the standard deviation,
of course...

375
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,428
Well, you did it, dude.

376
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,463
How does it feel to get
what you've always wanted?

377
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,465
<i>Chalmers loves Skinner</i>

378
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:29,300
<i>Bought him chili dinner</i>

379
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:32,337
<i>How many ways
did Skinner try?</i>

380
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,073
<i>One, two, three, four, five</i>

381
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,742
It feels just like this.

382
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:51,255
<i>Maybe you and me were never
meant to be</i>

383
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:54,724
<i>Just maybe think of me
once in a while</i>

384
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,804
So, guys,
what have you been up to?

385
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,373
Oh, went on a field trip
to the fire station,

386
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,542
but nobody told
the firemen we were coming.

387
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:13,244
Practiced my sax,
went to school.

388
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:15,747
Oh, we learned about Peru.

389
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,216
I went to work.

390
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,218
Lenny had a cold,
so he wasn't there.

391
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,619
Carl was there though.

392
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:24,556
Well, have I got a treat
for you all.

393
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:28,426
Tonight, we're going to see
Improv Shakespeare!

394
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,995
Washing machine!

395
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,564
Out, damned stain!

396
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,201
For there is a Tide Pod
in the affairs of laundry.

397
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:41,005
Can you imagine
Shakespeare using a Tide Pod?

398
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:43,274
No.

399
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:50,582
<i>Mad tooth bar chin‐up</i>

400
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:53,718
<i>Boxing out of her hair now</i>

401
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:59,424
<i>Still do the modern‐day
whack‐a‐mole ditto‐o‐o</i>

402
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:02,994
<i>What's that?
Good bartender</i>

403
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,563
<i>I had better head out</i>

404
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:11,102
<i>I said I wouldn't do it
if a poodle had a lid on</i>

405
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,475
<i>Mad tooth bar chin‐up</i>

406
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,744
<i>Boxing out of her hair now</i>

407
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,151
<i>Still do the modern‐day
whack‐a‐mole ditto‐o‐o</i>

408
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,686
<i>What's that?</i>
