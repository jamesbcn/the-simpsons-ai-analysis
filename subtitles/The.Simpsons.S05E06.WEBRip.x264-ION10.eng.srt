Fine. I can have

00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,276
Hey, Dad, I think state

203

require us to have a babysitter.

Haven't you seen "Home Alone"?

You're absolutely right, Homer.

208
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,789
We don't need a babysitter.

209
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,252
Wait a second.

210
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,917

344
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,072
I don't wanna be
a wet blanket,

345
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,359
but maybe you should
give yourself up.

346
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,192
Marge, it's a matter
of principle.

347
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,697
I just can't let
that deadbeat win again.

348
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,870
You're with me, aren't ya?

349
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,239
(thinking) <i>I should say something</i>
<i>reassuring yet noncommittal.</i>

350
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,906
(groans)

351
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,584
Look, Marge,
there's no reason

352
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,753
for you to get
dragged into this.

353
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,331
Once we lose the cops,
I'll let you out.

354
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,376
Well, I don't think
they're gonna be

355
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,589
that easy to lose.

356
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,629
These are professional
lawmen and--

357
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,965
Oh, my God!
It just disappeared.

358
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,049
It's a ghost car!

359
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,965
-(tires screech)
-(grunts)

360
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,425
There are ghost cars all over
these highways, you know.

361
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,426
-Hold me.
-Only if you hold me.

362
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,138
(coyote howling)

363
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,108
(shuddering)

364
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,941
You can call
a cab in there.

365
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,656
Well... bye.

366
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,618
I'm sorry about all this.

367
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,950
But you gotta admit,
we did have some fun.

368
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,945
Yeah. Everything before
the high-speed chase

369
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,037
was just lovely.

370
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,173
Hey. You're
a good friend, Marge.

371
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,711
Mmm.

372
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,505
(coin clatters)

373
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,104
This cross-country flight
from the law would be hell

374
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,140
if we didn't stick together.

375
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,643
Hey. Friends stick together.

376
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,016
It's amazing how through
all this adversity,

377
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,563
we managed
to stick together.

378
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,896
If there's one thing
decent folk do,

379
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,612
it's stick together.

380
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,782
I hate it when
the waffles stick together.

381
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,071
Sticking together
is what good waffles do.

382
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,985
(groans)

383
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,659
(siren wailing)

384
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,366
Thanks, kid.

385
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,341
Marge, what are you doing?

386
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,709
Ruth, I've done a lot
of thinking,

387
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,916
and I really
consider you a friend.

388
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,757
And an important part
of friendship is--

389
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,892
-(tires screech)
-(Marge screams)

390
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,969
-(siren blaring)
-You stupid kid!

391
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,965
You know that drives away
all my business.

392
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,177
See you tomorrow, loser.

393
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,346
(sizzling)

394
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,818
Mmm, engine-block eggs.

395
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,069
If we can keep these down,
we'll be sitting pretty.

396
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,032
-That's them!
-Quiet. I can't hear the eggs.

397
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,823
(snoring)

398
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,777
(grunts)

399
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,987
Hey, it's morning,

400
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,657
and Mom and Dad
aren't home yet.

401
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,905
Don't worry.
Mr. Hutz is still here

402
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,906
to take care of us.

403
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,578
Don't touch my stuff!

404
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,166
Hey. This isn't
the Y.M.C.A.

405
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,883
Dispatch,
this is Chief Wiggum

406
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,973
back in pursuit
of the rebelling women.

407
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,130
MAN (on radio): <i>All right.</i>
<i>Your current location?</i>

408
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,138
Oh. Uh, I'm, uh--

409
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,930
I'm on a road.
Looks to be asphalt.

410
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,144
Um, aw, geez.
Trees, shrubs.

411
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,726
I'm directly under
the Earth's sun... now.

412
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,733
MAN (on TV):
<i>We now interrupt this program</i>

413
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,685
<i>for a special bulletin.</i>

414
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,735
<i>We've just received word of</i>
<i>a high-speed desert chase.</i>

415
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,320
<i>The suspects have been</i>
<i>identified as Ruth Powers</i>

416
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,195
<i>and Marge Simpson</i>
<i>of Springfield.</i>

417
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,043
-(gasps)
-Cool.

418
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,999
I always knew someday
Mom would violently rise up

419
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,540
and cast off the shackles
of our male oppressors.

420
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,004
Eh, shut your yap.

421
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,094
<i>At the risk of</i>
<i>editorializing,</i>

422
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,958
<i>these women are guilty</i>

423
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,835
<i>and must be dealt with in</i>
<i>a harsh and brutal fashion.</i>

424
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,303
<i>Otherwise, their behavior</i>
<i>could incite other women,</i>

425
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,684
<i>leading to anarchy</i>
<i>of biblical proportions.</i>

426
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,766
<i>It's in Revelations,</i>
<i>people!</i>

427
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,313
(sirens blaring)

428
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,185
Look. We're only two miles
from the state line.

429
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,404
We're gonna make it.

430
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,283
We're gonna be okay.

431
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
My God! That must be
every policeman in Springfield.

432
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,115
That's it. I give up.

433
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,464
A single mother
can't win in a man's world.

434
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,750
Ruth, that's a lot of hooey.

435
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,134
It's not over
until it's over.

436
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,011
I'm sorry.
I should've asked first.

437
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:38,139
No, Marge. You did it.
We really are gonna make it now.

438
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,970
Oh, no!

439
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,766
They're headed right for
the Grand Chasm.

440
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,810
Oh, my God! They're gonna
drive right into it

441
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,104
just to teach us men a lesson.

442
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,858
And it's all my fault!

443
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,153
Marge. Marge!

444
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,815
-Homer?
-Look, Marge.

445
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,284
I'm sorry I haven't been
a better husband.

446
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,704
I'm sorry about the time
I tried to make gravy

447
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,912
in the bathtub.

448
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:02,952
I'm sorry I used
your wedding dress

449
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,365
to wax the car.

450
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,253
And I'm sorry--
Oh, well, let's just say

451
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,120
I'm sorry for the whole
marriage up to this point.

452
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,877
You're right.
I am lucky to have him.

453
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,759
But, please, Marge,
don't drive into that chasm!

454
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,588
BOTH: Chasm?

455

458
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,153
Ha! And to think
those idiot environmentalists

459
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,191
were protesting this landfill.

460
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,395
Solid waste.
I could kiss you.

461
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,527

Yech.

462
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,374

Ew!

463
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,739

Ugh!

464
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,035
(kiss) Ooh, I think
this was pizza.

465

MAN: <i>Ruth Powers was tried in</i>
