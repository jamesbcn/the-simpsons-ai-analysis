1
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:09,422
D'oh!

2
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:33,696
Oh, I was standing in this
line to use the bathroom,

3
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:35,698
but now my license
is expired.

4
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:40,036
Hey Dad, there's an arcade
across the street.

5
00:00:40,103 --> 00:00:42,672
And there's really no point
in all of us waiting in line.

6
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:43,739
Hmm.

7
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:52,398
Oh, I was invited to that party.

8
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:02,408
Oh, that's good.

9
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,412
Next.
Woo-hoo. First in line.

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,414
Brought you a gift bag.

11
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:11,283
All that's left
is banana Runts.

12
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,835
That's the worst Runt.

13
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:15,004
Back of the line, stranger.
Huh?

14
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:18,658
We used our last day of summer
vacation standing in this line,

15
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:20,192
and now it's time
for our reward.

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,427
Next in line.

17
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:23,346
What am I bid for next in line?

18
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:24,780
Five bucks.
Ten bones.

19
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:26,014
Half a cheesesteak.

20
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,451
I'll perform at
your birthday party.

21
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:30,152
Sober.
Quarter of a cheesesteak.

22
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,804
A nest with a robin's egg.

23
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,572
The wrapper of a cheesesteak.

24
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:36,191
I bid one lollipop.

25
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:40,062
Sold, to the lowest bidder.

26
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,217
Which of you losers
is next in line?

27
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:48,521
Hello, "Selma."

28
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:50,923
I'd like to submit
a change of address.

29
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:53,776
Leaving Mockingbird Lane,
Mr. Munster?

30
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:55,544
Excuse me?

31
00:01:55,595 --> 00:02:00,316
Dad, Aunt Selma's treating a mob
boss like an ordinary taxpayer.

32
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:02,802
And we've got
front-row seats.

33
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,154
So, you here
for an eye test?

34
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,889
Read this.

35
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:10,209
Process my form.

36
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:13,996
I'm afraid this is
the wrong form.

37
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:15,614
The one you want

38
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:19,351
is on that table.
And if I retrieve that form,

39
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:23,089
will I be able to maintain my
advantageous position in line?

40
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,291
Try it and see.

41
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,325
Nope.

42
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,310
Geez, we had a safe
full of gold in there

43
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:45,594
and it didn't ride so low.

44
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:50,065
My lick.

45
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:51,700
My lick.

46
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:53,302
My lick.

47
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,654
Hey, you licked the back.
That was my side.

48
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:57,456
Aw, brother germs!

49
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,444
Aw, sister spit!

50
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:09,351
Hmm.

51
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:13,239
Bart, this is a truffle.

52
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:14,690
You're a truffle.

53
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:18,477
A truffle is a fungus
that grows in tree roots.

54
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:21,163
It's one of the most prized
gourmet foods in the world.

55
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:23,399
Only you can make
tree poop boring.

56
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:31,724
Bart, you can
find them by smell.

57
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,292
That's amazing.

58
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,362
Restaurateurs use highly-trained
pigs to sniff these out.

59
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:41,267
Come on, numb nose.
Sniff me a truffle.

60
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:43,669
I don't know why
I flew you in from Italy.

61
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:45,604
First class, no less.

62
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,273
Plus you forget
to get the miles.

63
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,974
Interested in these?

64
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:52,244
Eh?
Jody Maroni.

65
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,213
But where is
your truffle pig?

66
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,748
You're lookin' at him.

67
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:57,616
A human pig.

68
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:00,135
Thank you, Lord,
for this abomination.

69
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:01,570
Eh, eh, eh.

70
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:04,657
You know-a the rule:
no truffles for truffle pigs.

71
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,427
And now that I have him,

72
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:10,396
I find a new use
for you

73
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:12,598
in my kitchen.

74
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,518
Yeah, that one's-a good.

75
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:17,987
Start on these.

76
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:19,855
Hey, don't run
with the knife.

77
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:22,308
Ah, stupid pig.

78
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,278
And I'll-a pay you top dollar
for any more truffles you find.

79
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:29,515
And whenever you eat here,
you get the best table.

80
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,517
Not one that goes
a-tikit-a-tikit-a-tikit-a.

81
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:32,751
Very nice.

82
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,977
The view was better
inside the sack.

83
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:45,247
You are one tough cookie.

84
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:49,552
I tell you what, I'll let you pick
which body part I cut off first.

85
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:51,754
Fine.
I choose my love handles.

86
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:54,523
What?
Then my arm wattles, my cankles,

87
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:56,725
and finish off
with my excess back fat.

88
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:58,761
You do not register
the level of fear,

89
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:00,663
say, Louie here would.

90
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,464
Yeah-- show some respect
for the process.

91
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:05,901
You asked what I wanted cut
off, and I want lipo.

92
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:08,437
Lots of lipo.

93
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:10,606
Or are you not a man
of your word?

94
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:14,810
I like you.

95
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:16,745
I don't know whether to knock
you on your kisser

96
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:18,781
or kiss you on your knockers.

97
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:22,785
I don't know whether to peck you on
the kisser, or kiss you on the...

98
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:24,453
You shall have your lipo.

99
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,722
Call our doctor friend
who owes us a favor.

100
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,457
Actually, we owe him a favor.

101
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:34,163
Do him two favors, then remind
him that he owes us a favor.

102
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,031
<i>Tony, the surgery was</i>
<i>a complete success,</i>

103
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:40,636
so can I take your cousin,
the "anesthesiologist"

104
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:41,937
off the payroll?

105
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,172
You certainly may.

106
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,891
Now where is my Selma?

107
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,161
Here's the part
that's not in the trash.

108
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:50,896
Ooh.

109
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:53,766
Boys, I'd like a little
privacy with Selma.

110
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,801
Why don't you take
the doctor out back?

111
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:59,438
Should we take care of him,
or "take care of him"?

112
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:01,941
Take care of him.

113
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,208
I don't know
what that meant.

114
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,944
Was it the first one
or the second one?

115
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:06,645
I can't ask him, otherwise
he's gonna "take care of me."

116
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:09,648
Now to take care of you.

117
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:13,819
Take care of me or
"take care of me"?

118
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,271
The one that's this one.

119
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:24,558
Selma, I just can't get
over the new you.

120
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:26,927
The world's a different place
when you've got a waist.

121
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,796
The clerk in the electronics
store asked me if I needed help.

122
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,448
Oh.

123
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,567
Well, well, well,
if it isn't

124
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:35,769
"before" and "after."

125
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,070
Blob and Blob Lite.

126
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:38,822
Tweedle Yuck
and Tweedle Blecch.

127
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,993
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

128
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:44,361
Um, Fat Tony.

129
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:47,881
I was just complimenting
your beautiful girlfriend,

130
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,816
while insulting
her hideous twin.

131
00:06:49,884 --> 00:06:51,985
I'm sorry, Fat Tony.

132
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:54,221
My husband doesn't
realize what he's saying,

133
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,323
then, five seconds
later...

134
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:57,624
Oh, my God.

135
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:00,494
All will be
forgiven.

136
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:05,032
If you sketch a portrait of
Patty showing her inner beauty.

137
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,968
You are cruel
but fair.

138
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,449
I'm trying.

139
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,700
I swear I'm trying.

140
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:30,490
Damn it.

141
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,376
I love it here.

142
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:52,412
The way the sun goes down
like a crooked boxer.

143
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,016
Selma, in this
<i>matto, svitato</i> world,

144
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:58,318
you've got to hold on
to the good things.

145
00:07:58,386 --> 00:07:59,653
Whoa.

146
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:01,988
Sounds like someone's
gonna propose here.

147
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,890
Shut up. You're
spoilin' the mood.

148
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,260
This is how I always
pictured this moment.

149
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,363
Ah.

150
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,382
Selma, will you share
my life with me?

151
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,820
Oh Tony, if there were an
Italian word for "yes,"

152
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,855
I'd be saying it right now.

153
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:25,512
♪ Con te partiro ♪

154
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,102
♪ Paesi che non ho mai ♪

155
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,207
♪ Veduto e vissuto con te... ♪

156
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,776
How many truffles
did you get?

157
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:41,244
More than I can count.

158
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,714
Brown gold. Tuscan tea.

159
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:47,300
Just think of what we can
do with that moolah.

160
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:50,269
Hm, I can't find my car.

161
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,495
No!

162
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,052
Bart, I am putting this
money safely in the bank

163
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,223
where you will earn zero point
zero zero one percent interest.

164
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:13,893
That's a lot of zeros.

165
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:15,061
You know, all this
truffle hunting

166
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,229
has made me a little thirsty.

167
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:17,497
Can we go home now?

168
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:19,298
Three more big ones
and we'll talk.

169
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:21,401
How big?
As big as a baby's head.

170
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:23,753
Okay.
That baby's head.

171
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:28,925
That tick sure done swelled
you up, Normalhead Joe.

172
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:31,127
Oh, man.

173
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:39,769
<i>Vi dichiaro marito e</i>
<i>presunta moglie.</i>

174
00:09:39,853 --> 00:09:41,888
You may now kiss one another.

175
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:50,480
Yes! I am so happy
I lived to see this day.

176
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:52,048
He did give her
the kiss of death, right?

177
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:53,349
No!

178
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:56,052
Oh, I decorated her
car for nothing.

179
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,743
Excuse me.

180
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:06,362
We can't find
our seats.

181
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,997
Marge and Homer Simpson.

182
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,532
Oh yes, you're at table 46.

183
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,234
Hmm?

184
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:12,769
Right this way.

185
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:16,222
There must be
some mistake.

186
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:18,775
Oh, it's no mistake.

187
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:19,976
That table is Tony
and his friends.

188
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,844
This table is the DMV.

189
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,780
This one, Legitimate
Businessmen of Shelbyville,

190
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:24,664
FBI,

191
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:25,998
children's table,
gifts,

192
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,750
then you.

193
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:30,670
And how do you
know the bride?

194
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:33,706
I'm her sister.
And you?

195
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:36,142
I bought her ping-pong
table on Craig's List.

196
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,911
Color yourself slighted.

197
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:42,498
So, how's your Tiramisu?

198
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:44,901
We haven't even gotten
our salads yet.

199
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:48,070
So, who wants a picture
with the happy couple?

200
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:52,508
Why did you seat
us in Siberia?

201
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:55,344
Because somebody's
husband has a reputation

202
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:58,281
for embarrassing himself
in public situations.

203
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:00,716
He's on his
best behavior,

204
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:04,103
which is very impressive considering
he's mad about a sports result.

205
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:06,272
Lousy St. Louis Cardinals.

206
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,343
Can't win the 1985 World
Series on Classic Sports.

207
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,312
Smile for the camera.

208
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,148
I was never sure
about this marriage.

209
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,782
With that attitude,

210
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,951
don't bother coming
to the brunch tomorrow.

211
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,170
We're throwing
the brunch!

212
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,596
Man, that photographer
got everything.

213
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:36,353
I still can't believe it.

214
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:40,372
I have never been so snubbed
at one of Selma's weddings.

215
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:44,679
Fat Tony!
Are you going to cut my head off

216
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:46,574
and leave it in a manger scene
at Christmas,

217
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,242
and then an old Italian nun
finds it?

218
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,811
And she's all,
"Oh, no, no, no!

219
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,780
"Oh, no, no!

220
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:55,449
He's too beautiful
to die!"

221
00:11:57,953 --> 00:12:00,604
Homer, to restore
the sisterical bond,

222
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:03,591
you and Marge are invited
to spend the weekend

223
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:06,527
with us at our house
down the shore.

224
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:07,962
Mmm.

225
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:10,998
So should I bring a towel?

226
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,867
We have towels.

227
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:17,371
Um,
I take a special size.

228
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:21,325
Come on, Bart. We've
been out here for hours.

229
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:23,027
Maybe we've found
all the truffles.

230
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:24,528
The only thing
I've dug up

231
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,697
was these
weird-looking mushrooms.

232
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,732
I'll dispose
of those for you.

233
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:32,019
<i>Koyaanisqatsi,</i>
you're about to get watched.

234
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:35,422
Listen, why don't we just
stop this and divide the money?

235
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,591
The money?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

236
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,894
The money is working for us.

237
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:42,663
What's not working
is your stupid sense of smell.

238
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,815
All I smell here
is desperation.

239
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:56,293
Ooh. Commentary by Philip Glass.

240
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:00,748
Huh?

241
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,550
No more distractions.

242
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,818
Find those truffles.
Mush!

243
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:07,655
If you think that makes me
a better musher, you're wrong.

244
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:09,290
Wait a second.

245
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,310
Huh?

246
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:14,728
This is our house.

247
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:18,182
There's nothing buried here
but hopes and dreams.

248
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:25,105
The truffle's
right over here.

249
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:31,445
The truffle's
in your room?

250
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:33,147
I thought you'd
been selling them.

251
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:36,150
Bart, I haven't
been selling the truffles.

252
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,751
I've been eating them.

253
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:39,386
Really? Why?

254
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:41,522
Vegetarian food
is so boring.

255
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,090
Pasta, soy.

256
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:44,858
You know what's
a bad pizza topping?

257
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:46,193
Broccoli!

258
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:47,795
But I worked so hard.

259
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:49,997
I've got dirt under my
fingernails I'll never get out.

260
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:51,265
Not that I'm going to try.

261
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,483
I'm sorry, Bart.

262
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,602
Take the last truffle.
Do whatever you want.

263
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,203
Sell it, eat it.

264
00:13:56,271 --> 00:14:00,240
Or give it to someone
who deserves it.

265
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:01,808
You spent your life
searching for these,

266
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,811
but you never had one.

267
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:06,447
Well, this is yours.

268
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:09,683
Bart, you've done a
truly kind thing.

269
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:26,266
Aah! Hey!

270
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:29,603
Oh, so that's why they
don't give pigs truffles.

271
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:34,525
I don't think this
is a good idea at all.

272
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:37,811
The only husband of Selma's
I liked was Disco Stu.

273
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:40,114
He was so upbeat--

274
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,533
till he found out
she didn't care for disco.

275
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,501
Yeah, that's his thing.

276
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:47,287
Anyway, Fat Tony and I
think this is a chance

277
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:49,239
to patch things up
between you and Selma.

278
00:14:49,324 --> 00:14:51,191
Plus, it's a free
weekend at the beach.

279
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:54,712
Hey, Louie.
Don't ask me why,

280
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:57,848
but I got a funny feeling
about the new guy.

281
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,868
Uh, let's brag
about our crimes.

282
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:02,803
You first.

283
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,940
Homer, Marge.

284
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:08,375
Come meet the family.

285
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:09,943
These are my nephews,

286
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:13,614
Stevie B., Stevie F.
and Vincent.

287
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,949
Yeah, but you can call us
S-Money, Jell-O Shot

288
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,251
and The Occurrence.

289
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:19,420
I will.

290
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,088
This is my niece, Tushie.

291
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:23,624
She's got two semesters
under her belt

292
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:26,160
in Contemporary
Italian-American Design

293
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:29,096
from Sandy Hook
Vocational Institute.

294
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:31,298
Ah, shut your
face, Uncle Tone.

295
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:34,401
God, you two
are super pale.

296
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:35,803
But not to worry--

297
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,771
every light in the house
is a tanning light.

298
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:38,939
Ooh.

299
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,307
Can you read by it?

300
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,675
No one's ever tried.

301
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:45,863
Yeah!

302
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,148
These people are always grinding
against each other,

303
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:49,767
and I think they're all related.

304
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:51,685
I wish we'd never come.

305
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:53,220
Selma?!

306
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:55,122
Va-va-va... wha...?!

307
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,057
Why can't you
support my marriage?

308
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:58,559
You've never
supported mine.

309
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,160
You married a pig.

310
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,496
Well, you married someone
whose first name is Fat.

311
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:07,184
I'm late for my
mani-pedi-spray-tan.

312
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:14,491
Ah, yeah!

313
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,659
Huh?

314
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,863
Yeah!

315
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:21,965
Boo-freaking-ya!
Losers chug!

316
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,951
Well, if you insist.

317
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:27,704
Chug! Chug! Chug!

318
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:29,440
Chug! Chug! Chug!

319
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,909
Ooh, yeah.

320
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:34,745
Mind if I join you?

321
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:36,280
Look at our men, Marge.

322
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:37,648
They're having a great time.

323
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:41,919
You are such a
gentle kisser.

324
00:16:41,986 --> 00:16:44,354
You were kind of all over the place.
Ooh!

325
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:45,856
Maybe I've been
mean to Homer

326
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:48,125
because I was jealous
of your happiness.

327
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:49,760
Now that I'm
truly happy,

328
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:52,229
maybe all four of us
can start over.

329
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:54,064
Hmm.

330
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:59,753
♪ Tell me,
when will you be mine? ♪

331
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:02,322
♪ Tell me, quando,
quando, quando? ♪

332
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:03,440
♪ Hey! ♪

333
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,627
The boys needed to breathe.

334
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:07,895
Wouldn't they be girls?

335
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:09,596
Mine are boys.

336
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:10,831
Hmm.

337
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:18,722
Which is
our room again?

338
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:20,524
You know-- it had that painting

339
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:22,843
of that lady and the monster
on the ceiling.

340
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,345
That was a mirror.

341
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:26,914
Looking good, boss.

342
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,882
Yeah, you look
like Johnnie Handsome

343
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,551
before we shot him
in the face.

344
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:33,153
Hey, I got to look
good for my goomar.

345
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:35,055
Goomar?

346
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:37,324
That's mob talk for "mistress."

347
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:39,593
Fat Tony has a mistress.

348
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:42,129
He's cheating on Selma?
That's crazy.

349
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:44,631
Why go out for
a hamburger

350
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,434
when you got rancid
steak at home?

351
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:50,470
Uh, I'll just sit here quietly.

352
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:52,890
Sorry.

353
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,509
How could Tony
cheat on me so soon?

354
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:07,845
You know, Selma,
from what I've seen here,

355
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:11,015
Fat Tony has a lot
of bad influences on him.

356
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,184
I walked
through a door last night,

357
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:15,286
and they were playing cards...

358
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:17,054
for real money.

359
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:20,224
Well, Homer and I are going
to take you away right now.

360
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:21,926
Oh, can't we stay one more day?

361
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:24,395
The Occurrence and I are going
to the tanning salon

362
00:18:24,463 --> 00:18:26,497
and get oiled and broiled.

363
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,953
Sorry, The Occurrence,
but to use your lingo,

364
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,455
Homer and I have
to be "that guy."

365
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:36,791
Whoa!
You don't want to be that guy.

366
00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:38,676
I don't want to
be that guy,

367
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,195
but Marge is making
me be that guy.

368
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:42,163
Enough!

369
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:45,399
Homer, good morning.

370
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,069
May I interest you
in a pool noodle?

371
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:51,839
We also got pool ziti,
pool fusilli--

372
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:55,726
or if you don't like those,
Mama will make you one special.

373
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:01,699
Mother Mary herself
couldn't make

374
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,618
a noodle big enough
to float this one.

375
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,152
<i>In nomine patris et filli...</i>

376
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,704
Tony, we have to leave.

377
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,406
For the record,
I want to emphasize

378
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:11,108
we're not leaving because
today is "cleanup."

379
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:12,727
Leave? Why?

380
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:15,029
Because you have a girlfriend!

381
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:16,480
Oh.

382
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,650
It is true,
but it is not what you think.

383
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,221
Where is she?
Where is this other woman?

384
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,289
You're the goomar?

385
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:27,157
I'm Fat Tony's wife.

386
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,592
You're the goomar.

387
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,328
You're nuts.

388
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:31,929
And I've got the
ring to prove it.

389
00:19:31,997 --> 00:19:34,231
That's a goomar ring.

390
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,334
This is a wife ring.

391
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,254
That's a wife ring?

392
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:41,555
Marge, don't look.

393
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:43,174
This doesn't
make any sense.

394
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:44,608
There was a wedding.

395
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:46,310
You exchanged vows.

396
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:48,479
I can explain.

397
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,016
<i>If you spoke Italian,</i>
<i>which I knew you did not,</i>

398
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:56,103
<i>you would have known that those</i>
<i>were goomar-goombah vows.</i>

399
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:19,110
Marge, if I ever tell you
I want to get married again,

400
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,729
I want you to stick
your thumbs into my eyes.

401
00:20:21,797 --> 00:20:23,681
Yeah, we can show you
how to do it.

402
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,484
The trick is, you don't stop
till you hear a pop.

403
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:31,022
You missed my first open house
as a licensed real estate broker

404
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:32,890
for this <i>brutta puttana?</i>

405
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,476
I've hit on
enough pizza boys

406
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:36,811
to know what
that means.

407
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:39,730
Then, bring it on,
sister!

408
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:44,552
You were right, Marge.

409
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,887
These people
are not for us.

410
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:50,841
In a good marriage,
you never say, "I told you so."

411
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:54,111
Which is lucky for me,
because you're always right.

412
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,813
Oh.

413
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,265
Mmm.

414
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:54,288
Shh!
