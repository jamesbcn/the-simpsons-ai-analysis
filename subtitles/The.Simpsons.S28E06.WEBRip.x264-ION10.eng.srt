<i>FOLKSY ANNOUNCER: Well,</i>
<i>it's the first Saturday in September,</i>

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,804

<i>ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):</i>
<i>And everybody's headed down</i>

7

8
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,229

12
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:27,901
Ladies and gentlemen,

13
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,156
your Springfield Neutrinos!

14
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,488

{\an8}BART:
Huh?

16
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:36,872
{\an8}NELSON:
Where'd everybody go?

17
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:37,873
{\an8}BART:
I can't see.

18
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,714
{\an8}(gasps)
They over-fogged the run-in!

19
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,170
{\an8}They put those kids in danger

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,790
{\an8}just to psych up the crowd.

21
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,337
{\an8}Yeah, are you psyched up now?

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,550
{\an8}Huh? Are you?!

23
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,009
{\an8}-(players panicking)
-(helmets clonking)

24
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,010
{\an8}Concussions!

25
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,602
{\an8}Concessions!

26
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,683
{\an8}-(door dings)
-Aah!

27
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,265
{\an8}(anxious chatter)

28
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,849
{\an8}My boy hit his head doing football!

29
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,345
{\an8}I'm a doctor's wife.

30
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,187
{\an8}Save my boy first!

31
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,572
{\an8}My boy needs an MRI!

32
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,569
{\an8}-(clamoring)
-Ow!

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,860
{\an8}Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

34
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,815
{\an8}With head injury concerns on the mind,

35
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,446
{\an8}the town has shut down
its peewee football program.

36
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,873
{\an8}Professor, what danger does this

37
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,871
{\an8}concussion threat truly pose?

38
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,913
{\an8}Uh, well, Kent,

39
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,956
{\an8}these children will need their brains

40
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,960
{\an8}unbruised for the demanding,
high-tech jobs

41
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:25,963
{\an8}of the future:

42
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,384
{\an8}polishing and buffing
our robot masters.

43
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,424
{\an8}Indeed.

44
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,667
{\an8}And here to defend youth football,

45
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,758
{\an8}we have... Nelson's dad.

46
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,933
{\an8}Are you wearing makeup?

47
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,971
{\an8}Is it worth the risk
to your son's health

48
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,425
{\an8}when only .1 percent
of youth football players

49
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,726
{\an8}make it to the pros?

50
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,729
{\an8}You saying my boy
doesn't have what it takes

51
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,231
{\an8}to play pro ball? Huh?

52
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,772
{\an8}Boy, show him your moves.

53
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,935
{\an8}Juke it, juke it!

54
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,153
{\an8}(grunting)

55
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,404
{\an8}Why are you dekeing it
when I said juke it?

56
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,446
{\an8}Take a lap!

57
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,609
{\an8}-Without football, Kent,
-(Nelson groans)

58
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,816
{\an8}how are kids gonna learn character
like I did,

59
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,327
{\an8}you stupid fruit-munch?

60
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,698
{\an8}And what is your problem, smart-nuts?

61
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,696
{\an8}(grunts)

62
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,827
{\an8}Which brings us to this question:

63
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,924
{\an8}if not football,

64
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,378
{\an8}what sport is safe for our children?

65
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,883
But there are so many club sports

66
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,844
that can eat up all our free time.

67
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,974
What about baseball?

68
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,260
(scoffs) Baseball--

69
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,643
rife with steroids!

70
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,099
Then test for steroids!

71
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,429
Oh, and then there'll be no home runs!

72
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,265
-(all arguing)
-Um, I think I-I may have a solution.

73
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,271
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

74
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,692
What about biathlon?

75
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,360
That teaches kids to ski and kill.

76
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,519
How about Frisbee-golf?

77
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,067
If I could just have your attention...

78
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,281
Hey, what about Filipino tooth-fighting?

79
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,281
It builds biting,
jaw strength and mouth work.

80
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,454
The champion for a long time was a dog.

81
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,623
(groans)
No one is listening to me.

82
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,952
Well, maybe no one wants to hear

83
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,286
your ridiculous idea.

84
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,541
Let's go.
We're late for prenatal yoga.

85
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,623
Milhouse is ten.

86
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,128
Why are we still doing that?

87
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,460
Poor Kirk.

88
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,795
No one listens to him.

89
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,130
Even Luann treats him like garbage.

90
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,125
(sighs)
Love's funny like that.

91
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,177
Help him out.

92
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,300
Make people listen to his idea.

93
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,507
Oh, why me?

94
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,967
I only came to this concert

95
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,806
because I was told it was a potluck.

96
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,812
(grunts)

97
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,813
(groans)

98
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,106
(arguing continues)

99
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,650
Attention, smothering parents

100
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,784
who only came to hear themselves talk!

101
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,651
-You're an idiot!
-(arguing quiets)

102
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,738
This guy has as much right to bore us

103
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,164
as any of you!

104
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,582
Take it away, buddy.

105
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,790
<i>(echoing)</i>
<i>Buddy, buddy, buddy...</i>

106
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,291
"Buddy." Huh.

107
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,882
Um, I've got an exciting sport

108
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,668
that's great exercise
a-and teaches teamwork.

109
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,673
Lacrosse.

110
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,384
-La-what?
-What-cross?

111
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,514
What-what?

112
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,510
Lacrosse.

113
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,761
It's the perfect combination
of America's two least-watched sports:

114
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,385
soccer and hockey.

115
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,522
(murmuring excitedly)

116
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,479
Any kid can learn to play lacrosse.

117
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,729
Even this.

118
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,483
(parents gasping)

119
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,192
This isn't a drive-in movie.

120
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,364
(parents gasping)

121
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,447
Everybody,

122
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,199
feel free to whip stuff at my son's face.

123
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,282
(laughter and indistinct chatter)

124
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,703
Yarr.

125
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,828
Now, hold on there.

126
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,874
Lacrosse has the second-highest
concussion rate,

127
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,038
right after football.

128
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,835
(chanting)
Safer than football!

129
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,841
Safer than football!

130
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,883
Hey, why don't we have this fruit-munch

131
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,007
teach our kids this crazy sport?

132
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,974
Me, coach your kids?

133
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,014
Most of you won't even make eye contact

134
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,268
when I'm weighing your yogurt.

135
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,890
I'll do it.

136
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,097
If Homer will coach with me.

137
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,107
Huh?

138
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,398
We've come too far together
on this crazy ride.

139
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,283
It wouldn't feel right
to do it without you...

140
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,280
buddy.

141
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,411
<i>(echoing)</i>
<i>Buddy, buddy, buddy...</i>

142
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,698
Mm?

143
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,870
Oh, fine,

144
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,581
I'll coach with this guy.

145
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,001
But I promise you this:

146
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,709
I will never stop complaining about it.

147
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,040
(cheering)

148
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,246
Stupid sport I never heard of...

149
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,876
make me wake up early on a Saturday...

150
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,594
probably have to slice oranges...

151
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,724
don't even know the rules

152
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,260
because I refuse to learn 'em...

153
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,473
my kids will probably suck at it...

154
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,644
and I'll have to kneel down
on photo day,

155
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,433
knees get all wet...

156
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,176
despite my bad attitude,

157
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,558
I'm thrilled by the nonstop action...

158
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,225
kids running towards me

159
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,694
with a look of joy
I've never seen before...

160
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,234
Dad, we won!

161
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,858
It's okay, kids.

162
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,454
What matters is you tried your best.

163
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,070
Have an orange slice.

164
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,617
No, we won!

165
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,910
Yes, we're all winners.

166
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,914
Because losing teaches valuable lessons.

167
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,617
Have an orange slice.

168
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,787
We did it, buddy.

169
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,915
You and I make a great team.

170
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,252
We won for real!

171
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,207
For the first time in our lives,

172
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,297
we can say "good game"
and actually mean it.

173
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,553
Good game!

174
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,974
Uh, good game!

175
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,063
Ha! That's loser talk!

176
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,186
(cheering)

177
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,231
(groaning)

178
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,355
Wow, pizza really does

179
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,904
taste sweeter after you win.

180
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,107
(humming happily)

181
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,118
Dude.

182
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,989
My kids have never won at anything.

183
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,196
All the girl does is read,

184
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,285
and the boy's got one of those

185
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,290
paying attention diseases
that isn't really a disease.

186
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,003
Awesome job, guys!

187
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,293
How do you know
so much about lacrosse?

188
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,837
Wait.
You want to know about me?

189
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,841
(disinterested mumbling)

190
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,843
Well, it all goes back
to my college days,

191
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:28,715
<i>where I was the star attackman</i>
<i>on our lacrosse team.</i>

192

(crowd cheering)

193
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,427
(marching band playing)

194
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,153
<i>I'd even been drafted to play in the pros</i>

195
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,939
<i>for the Milwaukee Zoom.</i>

196
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,532
<i>After scoring</i>
<i>the championship-winning goal,</i>

197
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,318
<i>I was on top of the world, man.</i>

198
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,362
<i>I was high-fiving everybody.</i>

199
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,195
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

200
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,870
<i>no one, and I mean no one,</i>
<i>was leaving me hanging.</i>

201
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,030
<i>I was slap-happy,</i>

202
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,288
<i>I couldn't stop myself, until...</i>

203
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,371
<i>I highed one five too far.</i>

204
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,747
-(metallic clank)
-(wrist shattering)

205
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,455
<i>Our school mascot, Sir Gudge-a-lot.</i>

207
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,799
<i>My Zoom dream died that day.</i>

208
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,215
Mm...

209
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,303
(grunts angrily)

210
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,559
Uh... Ah...

211
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,561
(metallic clicking)

212
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,352
My wrist healed, but my wrist in here...

213
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,727
never did.

214
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,613
I've never high-fived my own son.

215
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,731
The mascot wore a suit of armor?

216
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,898
Just like a knight!

217
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,526
Yeah, but now lacrosse
has brought us together.

218
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,823
Hey, a toast to new friendship!

219
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,577
Could I get a roll of toilet paper,
please?

220
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,080
I get nosebleeds when I drink.

221
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,000
To... new...

222
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,632

223
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,246

00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,222
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

226
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,549

230
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,400
It's 6:00 a.m. on a Saturday.

231
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,769
We have a weekend lacrosse tournament!

232
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,356
-(horn honking outside)
-There's Coach K!

233
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,441

Check out the travel van, brah!
(chuckles)

240
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,922
Two days, ten games,

241
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,169
700 miles and one sweet mixtape.

242
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,712

I'm pretty sure a mixtape

249
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,595
isn't just the same song
over and over again.

250
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,476
No, no, dude,
they're different live versions.

251
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,444
You can tell because some are longer.

252

{\an8}-(music stops)
-Hey, you want a hit off my vape pen?

253

{\an8}It tastes like passionfruit,

254

{\an8}and people think you're a smoker.

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,620
Why would I want that?

256
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,329

Don't worry. Marge isn't here.

-What?
-Let's both say it at the same time.

-Don't!
-Chipotle!

00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,273
Why would I want to go to a strip club?

I'm married to a naked lady.

Of course
I want to hang with you, buddy.

325

But, you know, I'm pretty tired
from all those YouTube videos

326
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,566
you showed me about whiskey making.

327
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,405
It gets its color from the barrel.

328
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,160
I know, the barrel.

00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,727
I'm sorry, kids,
but your coaches aren't here.

534
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,065
You're going to have to forfeit.

535
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,280
And now to blow this whistle
and make it official.

536
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,992
It's the Strip-a-copter!

537
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,953
I mean, it's a helicopter
I've never rented before.

538
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,789
Helmet up, kids.

539
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,673
Let's win ourselves a championship.

540
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,841
Who wants orange slices?

541
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,261
(cheering)

542
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,919
ALL: Yay!

543
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,505
No matter how bad our kids screw up
the rest of their lives,

544
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,845
they'll always have this moment.

545
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,351
Buddy, you deserve this.

546
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,523
(exclaims quietly)

547
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,021
-(bones cracking)
-(Homer and Kirk scream)

548
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,732
Just because we're in traction

549
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,522
doesn't mean this hospital room
can't swing.

550
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,897
<i>♪ So I think about my next drink ♪</i>

551
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,316
<i>♪ And it's you and me</i>
<i>and the bottle makes three tonight ♪</i>

552
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,445
(muffled groaning)

553
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,031
<i>♪ Yeah! ♪</i>

554
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,906
<i>♪ What do you mean it's last call? ♪</i>

555
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,216
{\an8}Hey, guys, I know all you
"Crushin' It" fans

556
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,218
{\an8}are super pumped
for my latest crush video.

557
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,391
{\an8}Sorry, no contest winner this week.

558
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,060
{\an8}Remember, to qualify,

559
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,058
{\an8}you have to be a subscriber
<i>and</i> leave a comment.

560
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,941
{\an8}Now, the secret to the ultimate
rice sammy

561
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,729
{\an8}is to make sure the rice is really wet,
li-like soaking.

562
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,725
{\an8}(high-pitched scrubbing)

563
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,276
{\an8}(chews and slurps)

564
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,399
{\an8}(high-pitched scrubbing)

565
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,355
{\an8}So after going in to find it
a third time,

566
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,616
{\an8}they just decided to leave
the colonoscopy camera inside...

567
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,620
{\an8}(high-pitched scrubbing)

568
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,911
{\an8}Five words:

569
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,204
{\an8}jet fuel can't melt steel.

570
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,538
{\an8}(high-pitched scrubbing)

571
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,212
{\an8}When I held the door for that guy

572
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,841
{\an8}and he didn't even say
thank you, I just lost it!

573
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,918
{\an8}(high-pitched scrubbing)

574
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,343
{\an8}Oh, man,
Milwaukee would've been so sweet.

575
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,593
{\an8}The Zoom were the kings of that town!

576
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,795
{\an8}(high-pitched scrubbing)

577
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,144
{\an8}(snoring)

578
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,060
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

579
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,018
