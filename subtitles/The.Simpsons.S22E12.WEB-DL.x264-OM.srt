that the word "correction" is
actually spelled with a "C."

Dad, I need a new

Son, if I just
bought you a glove,

30
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:02,836
you wouldn't
appreciate it.

31
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:04,471
I'm afraid you're
gonna have to

earn the money

33
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,709
Aw, come on, Dad.

34
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:09,976
Aw...

35
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:11,812
Oh no, not "the face."

36
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:18,719
Oh, life was
so much easier

37
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:21,788
when a machine told you
when to laugh.

38
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:33,133
I liked the producing,
the executive producing

39
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:35,602
and especially the co-producing.

40
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,806
But the supervising producing
was the best I've ever seen.

41
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:43,610
So anyway, that's why me
and Nana are taking a break.

42
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,263
Aw!

43
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,698
Oh, stupid cheap bike.

44
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:52,335
To think I was gonna
put fenders on you.

45
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:54,387
Oh, my God!

46
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,126
I think I just met the thing
I'm gonna die on.

47
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:23,784
Gotta have that minibike.

48
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:24,951
Oh, my God.

49
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:26,653
I've found my new look.

50
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:28,522
Those are girl overalls.

51
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,323
I could pull it off.

52
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:35,328
Can I have it, Dad?
Bart?!

53
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:36,663
Can I?

54
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:40,167
Thanks for not buying me
that glove

55
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:44,471
and teaching me
what's really important.

56
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,474
Bart, son,
if I bought you that bike,

57
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,442
you wouldn't appreciate it.

58
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,611
Because when you get
anything you want,

59
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,914
you don't want
anything you get.

60
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,248
What is this crap?

61
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:57,350
Are you wearing a wire?

62
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:00,987
Someday you'll understand
that I'm just being a good dad.

63
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,322
Are you kidding?

64
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,957
You're the worst dad
who ever lived.

65
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,792
I'd rather take my chances
in a hot car

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,360
than go in a store with you.

67
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:09,613
Why, you little...

68
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:12,565
Homer, a good father
is strong enough

69
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:14,868
that he doesn't need
to use his strength.

70
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,238
What Bart needs is for you to
strangle him with your love.

71
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:19,873
Hmm.

72
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:21,508
I never thought
of fatherhood

73
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,476
as something that
could affect a kid.

74
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:24,978
Son, I won't strangle
you anymore,

75
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:26,813
but I also won't get
you that minibike.

76
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:28,415
How about this?

77
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:31,284
I let you punch me in the face
and you get me a snowmobile.

78
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:32,319
I wish I could, son.

79
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:33,854
I really wish I could.

80
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:40,460
Now it's ready for garbage.

81
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:45,198
What's wrong, Homie?

82
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:47,434
Bart's mad because he wanted
me to buy him something,

83
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:50,070
but I didn't think it was
the right thing to do--

84
00:05:52,006 --> 00:05:54,241
Marge, not in front
of the refrigerator.

85
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:59,212
There's nothing sexier
than a man being a good dad.

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,347
Whoa.

87
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:03,316
Oh, well, in that case,

88
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:06,953
Lisa was using her
solar calculator yesterday,

89
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:09,890
so I opened the drapes
to let in more sun.

90
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:14,895
Just hope the kids
didn't hear us.

91
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,497
Well, maybe
your kids didn't.

92
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,204
Lise, I gotta talk to you.
I'm busy.

93
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:25,972
Don't you minimize me!

94
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:30,677
Fine. Just get in here.

95
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:33,747
How can I earn money to buy
the world's most awesome thing?

96
00:06:33,814 --> 00:06:35,415
You could deliver newspapers.

97
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:37,484
Kids don't deliver
newspapers anymore.

98
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,286
It's just creeps in trucks.

99
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:42,622
Maybe if you buckle down
and get good grades,

100
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,990
Dad will give you money.

101
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,159
Does he give you money

102
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:47,494
for getting good grades?

103
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:49,162
I've been doing the family's
books for years.

104
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,931
I take what I need.

105
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,199
You were right, Dad.

106
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,468
By not telling the teacher
that Jimmy cheated

107
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:57,570
on the French test,
it's like I cheated.

108
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:59,639
Well, as they say in Paris,

109
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:02,676
<i>"Ma voiture est pleine</i>
<i>de crème glacée."</i>

110
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:05,612
You just said, "My car
is full of ice cream."

111
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,850
Dad, if I get an "A"
on my math test,

112
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,252
would that be
worth some money?

113
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:16,890
Well, in season two,
when Sam got good grades,

114
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,826
he got a very surprising reward.

115
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:22,862
And if you do it, son,
you'll get the same.

116
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,464
There's no way
that means anything

117
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,232
other than I
get a minibike.

118
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,702

119
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:32,472

Oh, oh, right.

125
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:12,846
There's no such thing
as a playground ghost.

126
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:15,098
How could you
mistake him for me?

127
00:08:15,182 --> 00:08:18,518

ye killed in the first place.

I told all my friends
I was getting one.

144
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:11,905
about whether you
have a minibike,

145
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:13,373

00:10:48,484 --> 00:10:51,219
undesirable immigrants,
by which I mean

179
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:54,188
everyone that came after me,
including my children...

180
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:57,625
...so I'm offering to trade
your country nuclear secrets

181
00:10:57,693 --> 00:11:00,094
for a minibike.

182
00:11:00,162 --> 00:11:03,164
Concludingly yours,
Bart Simpson.

183
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:15,610
Hmm... hmm!

184
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:18,846
Marge, would you like a <i>Thicker</i>
<i>Than Waters</i> collectible plate?

185
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:21,816
Homer, you can't order
anything from that magazine.

186
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:23,785
It's 25 years old.

187
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:25,586
Oh, yeah? I'll show you.

188
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:29,057
"TV Guide Offer,
One World Trade Center..."

189
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:30,458
Did I get
any mail today, Mom?

190
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:33,394
Uh, well, of course you did.

191
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:34,595
A gutter
cleaning coupon?

192
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:37,765
Hey, they're
your gutters, too.

193
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,100
Oh!

194
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:43,738
Huh?

195
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,513
You must've found out
about my letters.

196
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:55,350
They were just a joke.

197
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:56,884
Really?
That's too bad.

198
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:59,120
Because we are very
interested in your offer.

199
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:03,991
Uh, you're just lucky
we picked you up

200
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,460
before the FBI got to you.

201
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:12,567
Another disgrace for the
French Bureau of Investigation.

202
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:17,038
Don't forget us,
the A-Team of Finland.

203
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:20,408
I pity the fool who messes
with B.A. Backstrom.

204
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,630
We accept your offer.

205
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:33,565
The secrets from
your father's nuclear plant

206
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:35,667
for one
Street Assassin minibike.

207
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,870
Just transfer everything

208
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:38,737
to this flash drive.

209
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,374
I don't know.

210
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,476
Can I really betray my country?

211
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,312
I say the
Pledge of Allegiance every day.

212
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,114
You pledge allegiance
to the flag.

213
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,883
And the flag is
made in China.

214
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,885
Hmph.

215
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:55,120
We return
to "Thicker Than Waters,"

00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:57,422

219
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:04,163
Crap, total crap.

220

You, writer,
what's your name?

221
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,000
Um, David Mamet.

222
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,836
Well, Mr. Mamet,
why don't you learn

223
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:12,771
how to
write a script!

224
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:16,742
Hmm...

225
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:17,976
I could use that.

226
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:28,954
Dad, I was thinking
about it, and you're right.

227
00:13:29,022 --> 00:13:30,956
You shouldn't buy me
something I didn't earn.

228
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:32,691
And because you gave me
the tough love

229
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,993
I didn't know I needed,

One of those retinal

250
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:21,266
Aw, they gave me
my own vanity plate.

251
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:42,821
You're gonna love
meeting my friends.

252
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:46,825
Where the hell
did that come from?

253
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:48,560
It's from me, son.

254
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,062
Want me to take it
up to your bed

256
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:52,364
No!

257
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:54,366
Why in the world
would you get me this?

258
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:56,735
Because you've been
such a great kid lately,

259
00:15:56,803 --> 00:15:59,438
and I wanted to show you
I appreciated it.

260
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:00,706
Oh.

261
00:16:00,773 --> 00:16:03,175
That's great.

262
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:07,012
I wouldn't trade it for
all the tea in... China...

263
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,114
Something wrong, Bart?

264
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:12,384
You betrayed your
country for no reason.

265
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:15,420
Now you're gonna see
stars and stripes forever!

266
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,972
I've got summer squash!

267
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,841
Mm, the boy's
acting really weird.

268
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,877
I did everything
that TV show told me to,

269
00:16:39,944 --> 00:16:41,612
and he's still not happy.

270
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,249
Well, maybe you shouldn't listen
to a 30-year-old TV show

271
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:46,750
that only got on the air

272
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:48,218
'cause the creator
had evidence

273
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:50,721
the network president
ran over a guy.

274
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:52,956
Where's he going?

275
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:03,951
Why on earth would a child
go to the zoo?

276
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:15,829
It's still here. Yes!

277
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:18,632
I get the flash drive back
and the manila envelope!

278
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:23,387
Aha! Typical
American treachery!

279
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:25,789
I can't believe a boy
who would betray his country

280
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:27,024
would betray
a different country.

281
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:28,258
Unbelievable!

282
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:29,493
Terrible!

283
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,094
Masters, I can explain.

284
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:32,095
Explain nothing!

285
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:33,363
Hand over the flash drive.

286
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:38,702
Then you leave
us no choice.

287
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,870
A teddy bear?!

288
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:42,940
A teddy bear
made in China.

289
00:17:52,684 --> 00:17:53,851
Step away from the traitor!

290
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,352
Dad!

291
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,521
The boy's flash drive
may be in there,

292
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:01,325
but I've got a lifetime
of nuclear secrets up here.

293
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:04,494
Okay, but don't
read our subtitles.

294
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:23,780
I know what
you're saying.

295
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:26,049
I understand food talk
in every language!

296
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:31,922
American fatso, your knowledge
helped us build this plant.

297
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,690
We would like you
to have the honor

298
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:36,059
of cutting
the ceremonial ribbon.

299
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:43,433
Um, I'll see myself out.

300
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,106
Okay, who can take me to
the airport for less than $20?

301
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:55,445
I can stand here all day.

302
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:58,248
Oh, my feet hurt.

303
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:01,852
You know, Dad,
I really did have

304
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,620
a good time
hanging out with you.

305
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:07,391
Well, now it's time for
the best kind of bonding--

00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,860

other in silence,

307
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,796

Rebecca,
you briefly inspired

313
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:04,047
the hairstyle called
"The Lizzie."

314
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:06,383
Is "The Lizzie"
with us here tonight?

315
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,385
I was clear with your people

316
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:10,887
