1
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,089
Don't rot your brain
on Satan's calculator.

2
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:13,794
Babies need real toys
like these.

3
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:23,881
It's Princess Maggie.

4
00:00:23,948 --> 00:00:25,985
Princess Maggie's here.

5
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:27,856
Princess Maggie, what's wrong?

6
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,392
The girl is bored.

7
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,231
Royal court,
entertain my daughter at once.

8
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,572
No princess can frown
when her eardrums are pulsing

9
00:00:35,638 --> 00:00:38,511
with the beat
of iambic pentameter.

10
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:40,982
That's quite a frown.

11
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,451
Out of my way!

12
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:45,858
I've got no shame
or regard for my own well-being.

13
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:48,496
Hey, hey!

14
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:52,171
You fools have failed
the princess.

15
00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:54,810
We have no other option.
We must give her...

16
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:57,448
the special gift.

17
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,856
Goodbye, Princess Maggie.
Goodbye.

18
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:25,137
¡Ay, caramba!

19
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:29,913
Oh, boy.

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,149
Homer,

21
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:33,286
your father's
messing up the baby again.

22
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:21,984
Way ahead of you, pal.

23
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:38,249
My eyes...

24
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,354
Where did all this traffic
come from?

25
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:00,026
It's like my favorite
movie ever, Cars 3.

26
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:02,030
I hated Cars 1 and 2.

27
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:10,013
I'm unsupervised.

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,249
Have no fear.

29
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:13,286
Safety is here.

30
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:15,825
Traffic, no traffic...
What's the difference?

31
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:19,064
I got nothing to be late for
and no one who cares.

32
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:36,733
Let's take this from Disney+
to HBO Max.

33
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,479
Oh, Marge,
you haven't honked

34
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,183
like this since high school.

35
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,187
It's a traffic jam.

36
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:57,407
My, my, look at all those middle
fingers raised to the Lord.

37
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:01,115
Wait a minute.
That car looks familiar.

38
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:02,919
Hey, that looks like...

39
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,996
No, don't go there, Moe.
Don't go there.

40
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,766
Erase, erase, erase!

41
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,600
Oh, come on.

42
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,504
We put up a sign and everything.

43
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,073
This is so unreal.

44
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,312
Why did all this traffic
suddenly appear on our street?

45
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,450
Wayz told me this was
the fastest route.

46
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:38,089
That's important when
you're selling your organs.

47
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:39,458
Oh, my God, I've heard of this.

48
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:40,895
That app routes traffic

49
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,732
through a quiet
residential neighborhood,

50
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,336
turning it into
a gridlocked nightmare.

51
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:54,622
Sorry, I met someone
in another car.

52
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:07,314
We need to do something.

53
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,485
This is driving
the neighborhood nuts.

54
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:12,157
Even the guy who's always
in his underwear.

55
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:14,094
This is more
than I put on for Zoom.

56
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,132
Enough with the traffic.

57
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:18,035
I'm calling
a neighborhood meeting.

58
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:21,208
Neighborhood Meeting.

59
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:22,812
Neighborhood meeting.

60
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,553
Please rate my app.
Please rate my app.

61
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,859
Two stars? My IPO is ruined.

62
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:32,164
Ruined! Ruined!

63
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,272
We're here to talk about

64
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:39,411
the terrible problem
on our street.

65
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:41,415
- Finally.
- About time.

66
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:45,423
We assume you're talking
about you, the Simpsons.

67
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,526
Wha...?

68
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,196
I've seen the boy's moons
more times

69
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:50,501
than I've seen the real one,
and I'm an astronomer.

70
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:52,103
What's wrong with us?

71
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,276
You haven't stopped by
to say hello in 25 years,

72
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:57,013
and I live next door.

73
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,286
The only good one's the baby,
and she shot a guy.

74
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,563
Wait, are we ignoring
the elephant in the room?

75
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:05,664
By which I mean
the big, fat husband.

76
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,735
Every time Homer
wears corduroys,

77
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:10,908
I just hear those thighs
scraping, scraping, scraping.

78
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:13,647
Oh, my God.
I'm starting to get the idea

79
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:16,118
you think
we're not good neighbors.

80
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:19,759
You see? You see?

81
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,495
Now, don't worry, my friends.

82
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:23,834
I'm stepping forward
to fix this traffic.

83
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,173
And by doing so, maybe...
just maybe I'll fix

84
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,244
my reputation with you all.

85
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:34,656
So just say to me what I say
to Tinker Bell: "I believe."

86
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:38,429
And... off I go.

87
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,013
Um... no.

88
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:49,217
"Identify all traffic lights."

89
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,320
Done.

90
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:52,023
"Identify all yield signs."

91
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,192
Done.

92
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,029
"Identify all the crosswalks."

93
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:58,369
Oh! Lisa, help me.

94
00:06:58,436 --> 00:06:59,739
Done.

95
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:01,342
"Identify all fire hydrants."

96
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:02,545
Done.

97
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:04,014
Jesuits? Done.

98
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,617
20th-century dictators?

99
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:07,722
Uh, overrated fiction?

100
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:10,894
Hyperintelligent
cartoon characters?

101
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,631
Vegan nut milks?

102
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,535
Future criminals?

103
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,573
Aah! New England doorways!

104
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,844
Oh, forget this.
I'm calling instead.

105
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,315
You've reached
Wayz customer service.

106
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:24,889
You have 5,700 callers
ahead of you.

107
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:28,530
Now, please enjoy the frustrated
noises of other callers on hold.

108
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:32,671
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

109
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,046
You again?

110
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,054
Can it be her,
after all these years?

111
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:45,163
The woman I thought was the one
stuck behind my car?

112
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,163
Hi, Moe. I missed you.

113
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,700
I never should've left.

114
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:07,106
Maya. The longest,
best relationship of my life.

115
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:10,112
That was a great six days.

116
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,918
You're a good kisser.

117
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:15,657
Yeah.
I practice by siphoning gas

118
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:17,661
out of other people's tanks.

119
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:21,101
So, is there a knob or an
"open sesame" type deal or what?

120
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,038
My house is over there.

121
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:24,105
Wha...?

122
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:31,723
Every day since you left me,
I've written you a letter.

123
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:34,795
Really wish I had gotten
your address.

124
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:43,713
So, how you been, Maya?

125
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,285
Well, I finally got my PhD.

126
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:47,855
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

127
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:49,792
You taking medicine
for that or what?

128
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,161
Oh, Moe.

129
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:53,733
It's nice to laugh again.
How are you?

130
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,403
Oh, I-I'm doing great.

131
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,875
Yeah, the factory closed,
so there's lots of new drunks.

132
00:08:57,942 --> 00:08:59,745
And, uh, oh, the bathroom possum

133
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:02,250
is getting real good
at handing out them combs.

134
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,295
Who am I kidding?

135
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:09,966
My life is a wreck, Maya.

136
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:13,305
The face recognition software
on my phone says, "Yuck."

137
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,844
My playlist only has
breakup songs.

138
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:18,349
It's rough,
I'm telling you, yeah.

139
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:21,088
I miss you, Moses Marie Szyslak.

140
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:23,693
Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't give me that look.

141
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,131
I can't go through it
again, Maya. I can't.

142
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,437
Ah, just look at you walking
toward me, coming closer,

143
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:31,441
with those big green eyes
of yours

144
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:32,978
and the great-smelling hair,

145
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:36,118
skin smoother
than American cheese.

146
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:43,198
But I want a drink now.

147
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:52,316
Oh, I wish this moment could
last forever, like, uh...

148
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,423
uh, I don't know, uh,
Henry Winkler's career.

149
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:57,427
Boy, that guy
never jumped the shark.

150
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:59,164
Not even when
he jumped the shark.

151
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,105
Just so I know, have you had
another girlfriend since me?

152
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:04,642
Uh, not really, no.

153
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,144
Uh, no one could match you.

154
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:09,050
I mean, I have been
catfished a few times.

155
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:10,186
Hey, Moe.

156
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:12,691
It's us, "Online Gloria."

157
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:15,229
I'll kill you!
Also, I love you.

158
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,306
Oh, Moe, you poor guy.

159
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,078
Oh, everything is perfect.

160
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:27,186
Which it always is
until I say, "I love you."

161
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,896
I love you.

162
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,979
I love you. Will you marry me?

163
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,393
To hell with women.

164
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,799
I love you, New York.

165
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:53,405
Help me. Spider-Man!

166
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,089
Professor, can you get
the traffic off our street?

167
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:03,860
I'll give you anything
except for money

168
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,396
or credit for what you did.

169
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:09,137
The only way to defeat
a global data behemoth

170
00:11:09,204 --> 00:11:11,474
is to get into the source code.

171
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:15,015
Just look what I did here
on, uh... on the Wikipedia.

172
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:20,392
Welcome to Wayz.

173
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,833
We figure out the fastest route
to get you where you want to go.

174
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,471
Our secret?
Always collecting data.

175
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:28,175
But we would never misuse it.

176
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:29,945
Who do you think we are, Google?

177
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:31,983
Disclaimer:
We're owned by Google.

178
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:33,085
I've got the answer.

179
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,525
What if we made your street...

180
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:37,895
...not exist?

181
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,798
Well, where would we live?

182
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,502
Well, that's quite silly.

183
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:44,775
It would, of course,
still exist in real life,

184
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:47,581
but I could make it disappear
from the database.

185
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,054
All right, let us see here.

186
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,225
Uh, keystrokes, keystrokes,
escape key,

187
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:56,666
both colon and semicolon,
backslash, backslash,

188
00:11:56,732 --> 00:12:00,239
ampersand...

189
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:03,078
we come to a new day
on "no such street."

190
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:12,898
Never again
will we be afraid of cars.

191
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,704
Get thee out of my way, English!

192
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,210
It's time to play
in the streets!

193
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:21,448
Haw-haw!

194
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:31,134
Climate change is real.

195
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,113
They know I did this.

196
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,718
They're making eye contact
with me. Eye contact.

197
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:42,223
Even the guy
with the boat in his driveway.

198
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,962
Hey, hey, Homer, want to come
on my boat with me?

199
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:45,964
In the water?

200
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,031
Eh, we'll see.

201
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,235
Uh, one step at a time.

202
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,372
I will never get tired of this.

203
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,611
Never. Never, ever.

204
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:55,850
So, what do you feel like doing?

205
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,188
I don't know, I...
I feel like singing.

206
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:25,275
Hey, are you guys an item again?

207
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:27,881
Well, maybe, maybe.

208
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:29,585
We definitely are.

209
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,589
He has a toothbrush at my place.

210
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:33,158
Yeah, but, yeah, it's a rental.

211
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:36,064
Moe's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

212
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,703
And this time, it's gonna last.

213
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,740
Way to go, Moe. Three cheers.

214
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:42,243
Hip, hip, hooray!

215
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:44,715
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip...

216
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:46,752
Homer, come in
the alley with me.

217
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:49,858
My doctor warned me not
to cut off a "hip, hip, hooray."

218
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:53,799
Look, Maya left me once.

219
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,703
I just know she's gonna
leave me again.

220
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,406
This-this is a disaster.

221
00:13:57,473 --> 00:14:00,345
You're the only guy here who
knows how to hold on to a woman.

222
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,817
What is your secret?
How do you keep Midge?

223
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,255
Well, it's, uh... it's, um...

224
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:08,028
It helps
if you get them pregnant.

225
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,900
Please, I need some actual,
real advice here.

226
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:13,104
Yeah, I better call Midge.

227
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:14,040
Hello.

228
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:15,586
Honey, I'm here in the alley
with Moe.

229
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:17,379
The only woman
who ever loved him came back,

230
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:19,383
and he's afraid
she's gonna leave him again.

231
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,587
What should he do?

232
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,456
Hand him the phone.

233
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:24,661
Moe, trust love.

234
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:25,897
Gotcha.

235
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:27,166
Your wife's an idiot.

236
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,836
Another tray of doughnuts.

237
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,773
This time from
that family over there.

238
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,044
Geez, I can't take
all this adulation.

239
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:35,215
This must be what drove
Randy Quaid crazy.

240
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:36,919
Mr. Simpson, will you throw out

241
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:38,623
the first pitch
at my Little League game?

242
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:41,027
Want to have coffee
on my boat in the parking lot?

243
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:42,764
Do you ever take it
in the water?

244
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:43,933
Not yet.

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,903
Please, I'm just here to eat.

246
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,741
Geez, you were mad
they didn't like you,

247
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
and now you're mad
they like you.

248
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,449
I just want to be left alone
with my to-do list.

249
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,753
Excuse me.

250
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,723
Will you be godfather
to my baby?

251
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,359
Let me see it.

252
00:14:57,426 --> 00:14:58,996
Ugh. Pass.

253
00:14:59,063 --> 00:14:59,898
Okay, Moe.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

254
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,506
I'm just getting
some stuff for dinner.

255
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:05,442
- Love you.
- Mwah.

256
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,179
Love you, too.

257
00:15:07,246 --> 00:15:10,118
Moe. Oh, Moe.

258
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:14,260
Look at you. Look at us.

259
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,364
She's not gonna come back.

260
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:18,602
- They never come back.
- Oh, yeah?

261
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,341
Well, this time,
I'm not gonna listen to mirrors

262
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:22,476
or mud puddles

263
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:24,948
or my upside-down face
in a spoon.

264
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:27,453
This time, I'm gonna believe.

265
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,390
Oh, no, you're not.

266
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,995
No one could love you.

267
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,398
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

268
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,570
What does it take
to get a beer around here?

269
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:36,772
Shut up!

270
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,776
Shut up?
I would stop coming here

271
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:41,013
if you weren't the only place
in stumbling distance.

272
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,383
You are not real.

273
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,755
You're just that nagging
voice of self-doubt

274
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:46,124
that lives in my head.

275
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,261
That's right.
Easy in, easy out.

276
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:50,031
Well, this time,
I'm gonna stop you

277
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:52,469
before you wreck my life.

278
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:57,680
Now you're a loser
with seven years bad luck.

279
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:18,689
I guess what
we're trying to say is...

280
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:23,164
You're right.

281
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:25,035
You beautiful bastards
are right.

282
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:31,047
Ah, yeah.

283
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:35,857
Huh? What the...?

284
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:38,027
Moe? You're hiding here?

285
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:40,766
Yeah. Bart's treehouse
is the one place

286
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,336
no one will look for me.

287
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,240
Plus, there are
no girls allowed,

288
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:46,244
which, uh, helps.

289
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,214
Moe's going through
a tough time, son.

290
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,584
Just play around him.

291
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:51,655
We'll just pretend
he's a dead, rotting alien.

292
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:52,722
Thank you, son.

293
00:16:57,634 --> 00:16:59,270
The alien's alive!

294
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:01,274
- And it has feelings.
- Kill him!

295
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:12,931
I'm sorry, no breakfast

296
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:15,168
until you get Moe out
of the treehouse.

297
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:19,176
And I'll keep your bacon safe
while you're gone.

298
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:23,217
Thank God I have
my pocket bacon.

299
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:27,259
Moe, you can't stay here
anymore.

300
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,463
Sure, I can. Uh, you want
some eggs with that?

301
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,735
I got 'em out of that nest
over there.

302
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,071
Just one.

303
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,975
I don't want to be rude.

304
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,912
Listen, Moe,
every once in a while,

305
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:40,352
a beautiful woman falls in love
with a homely guy like us.

306
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:42,222
You got to make the most of it.

307
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:45,428
If Kevin James can find
happiness, why can't you?

308
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:47,667
And he was always
wearing shorts.

309
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,640
You know, after all these years,
I dated all these women,

310
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:53,579
and it always just goes back
to square one.

311
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:55,181
Lonely old Moe.

312
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,119
Well, there is
a way around that.

313
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:58,822
You could propose.

314
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:00,425
Wha...?

315
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:03,632
What are you proposing
I propose?

316
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:06,003
I mean the big "M."

317
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,007
- Murder-suicide?
- No.

318
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:10,378
- Marriage.
- Marriage? Whoa.

319
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:12,249
You mean I could have
the thing you're always

320
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:14,688
coming into my bar
and moaning about?

321
00:18:16,758 --> 00:18:18,294
You know what? She's worth it.

322
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,398
I'll give it a shot.

323
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,841
Okay. This is as far as we go.

324
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:26,343
Yeah, yeah, okay.

325
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,414
Let me just
straighten myself up.

326
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:48,054
You'd better speak fast,
or for the second time,

327
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:49,991
you're gonna lose
the first good thing

328
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:51,427
that's ever happened to you.

329
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:53,331
I'm so sorry.
You're great, so great,

330
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:54,968
and all I've been is afraid.

331
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:00,311
But all I got to do
is look in your eyes.

332
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:02,115
Baby, I love you so much.

333
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,054
You stick with me, you'll get
everything you ever wanted.

334
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,958
I will never doubt you again.

335
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:08,461
You can control the remote.

336
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:10,699
You can pick all our vacations.

337
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:13,404
And because I know
the ladies like it this way,

338
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,043
I will leave the toilet seat on.

339
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,982
Maya, will you marry me?

340
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,028
Forget it, loser.

341
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:26,965
Gorillas like us
don't get the girl.

342
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,673
We're lucky if our cage
gets hosed down once a week.

343
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,008
Yes.

344
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:33,946
I knew it! That's it.

345
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:35,549
I'm never getting up again.

346
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:38,221
Staying here, on the ground.

347
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:40,225
Wait, you-you said yes.

348
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,864
Yes, Moe. Yes.

349
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:15,696
Good song, but, uh,
the movie is crap.

350
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:23,044
What is it, Mosie?

351
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,413
Oh, it's just, uh...

352
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:26,183
I ain't never been able
to use this...

353
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,787
until now.
