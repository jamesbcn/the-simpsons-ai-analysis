So, isn't that what we're all
asking in our own lives?

170
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,247
Where's my elephant?
I know that's what I've been asking.

171
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,245
(electrical crackling)

172
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,337
Look, our ratings are down,
and the station is being swamped

173
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,843
with angry calls
and letter bombs.

174
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,846
-And it's all your fault.
-Yes, it is, ma'am.

175
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,930
This is the DJ-3000.

176
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,096
It plays CDs automatically,

177
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,145
and it has three distinct
varieties of inane chatter.

178
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,939
MALE VOICE: <i>Hey, hey, how about</i>
<i>that weather out there?</i>

179
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,065
<i>Whoa, that was</i>
<i>the caller from hell.</i>

180
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,453
<i>Well, hot dog,</i>
<i>we have a "wiener."</i>

181
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,200
Man, that thing's great.

182
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,622
Don't praise
the machine.

183
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,831
If you don't get that kid an elephant
by tomorrow, the DJ-3000 gets your job.

184
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,167
(grunts)

185
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,040
<i>Looks like those clowns</i>
<i>in congress did it again.</i>

186
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,127
<i>What a bunch of clowns.</i>

187
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,512
(laughs)

188
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,218
How does he keep up
with the news like that?

189
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,838
-(doorbell rings)
-(yawns)

190
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,061
-(gasps)
-(tires squeal)

191
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,678
(Marge, Homer gasp)

192
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,925
Whoo-ho-ho-ho!

193
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,727
(trumpets)

194
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,194
(elephant trumpets)

195
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,992
(snorting)

196
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,322
Homer?

197
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,826
It looks like
it could gore.

198
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,079
(chuckles)
It does look like Al Gore.

199
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,251
Oh, he smells worse
than anything.

200
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,500
Hey, you, elephant! Lift me up
on your back, man. Whoo!

201
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,754
(Marge gasps)
Bart!

202
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,166
(grunts)
Cool!

203
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,087
(chuckles)
He tried to kill me.

204
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,176
I really think
this is a bad idea.

205
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,972
Marge, I agree with you
in theory.

206
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,306
In theory,
communism works.

207
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,022
In theory.

208
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,478
{\an8}Look, he thinks
he's people.

209
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,197
(trumpets)

210
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,371
I think I'm gonna
call him Stampy.

211
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,123
(trumpets)

212
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,705
{\an8}-What's he yelling about?
-He's hungry.

213
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,841
{\an8}Here you go, Stampy.
Eat it slow. It has to last for--

214
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,260
You ate it too fast.

215
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,679
Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't
move, it wouldn't get so hungry.

216
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,138
You can't do that, Dad.
It's cruel!

217
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,309
Oh, everything's cruel
according to you.

218
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,518
Keeping him chained up
in the backyard is cruel.

219
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,519
Pulling on his tail
is cruel.

220
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,441
Yelling in his ears
is cruel.

221
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
Everything is cruel.

222
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,565
So excuse me if I'm cruel!
(yells)

223
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,319
-(chomps)
-(muffled yelling)

224
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,533
{\an8}(grunts,
breathing heavily)

225
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:20,155
Now I've had my head in an elephant,
a hippo and a giant sloth.

226
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,914
(swallowing)

227
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,787
(crunching)

228
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,544
{\an8}(grunts)

229
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,586
{\an8}I think you're taking unfair
advantage of my generous offer.

230
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,010
-Shut up!
-(labored breathing)

231
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,219
He can't just eat peanuts, Dad.
He needs plants to live.

232
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,091
Plants, eh?

233
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,101
(squirrels chittering)

234
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,734
Strip the bark now, Stampy.

235
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,611
Hey, any more arboretums
around here?

236
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,768
No!

237
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:56,356
(Homer gasps) That bird!
He's killing the elephant! Stop him!

238
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,737
No, Dad,
he's grooming him.

239
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,584
Grooming him, eh?

240
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,788
Oh, Homer, there's
a bird on your head.

241
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,082
I know.
He's grooming me.

242
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,456
Mm, elephant fresh.

243
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:14,764
(several dogs barking)

244
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,760
(Stampy trumpets)

245
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,472
(silence)

246
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,643
(straining)

247
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,389
Good night, Stampy.

248
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,310
(sniffing)

249
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,268
(Bart sighs)

250
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,646
(yawns, grunts)

251
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,780
Uh-- Ahem.

252
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,291
Thanks, Bud.
Appreciate it.

253
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,331
-Hmm.
-Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?

254
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,798
Nah. He doesn't wanna learn,
and I don't wanna teach him.

255
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,418
We get along fine.

256
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,125
-(heavy panting)
-Hey, what's with them?

257
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,217
I think they're trying
to get some attention.

258
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,012
Oh. Good luck!

259
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,807
Look at these bills.
"Chain for elephant."

260
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,601
"Shots for elephant."
"Oversized decorative poncho"!

261
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,727
Technically, it's for a giraffe,
but I think I can let it out a little.

262
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,275
Well, these bills will have to be
paid out of your allowance.

263
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,529
You'll have to raise my allowance
to about $1,000 a week.

264
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,951
-Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
-(doorbell rings)

265
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,831
{\an8}-Can we see the elephant?
-We'll pay you money.

266
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,540
For the ninth time, no!

267
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,541
(doorbell rings)

268
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,673
Wait a minute.
This gives me an idea.

269
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,720
Mm, here's
a better sign, Dad.

270
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,929
I don't have time
to read it.

271
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,259
Just give me
the gist of it, son.

272
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,763
{\an8}(playful chattering)

273
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,353
-(grunts)
-Your kid flew five feet.

274
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,845
That counts as a ride.
Two bucks.

275
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,516
That was never five feet.

276
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,935
That animal of yours
is certainly bad-tempered.

277
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,574
{\an8}Yeah, well, you'd be
grumpy too

278
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,190
{\an8}if you were taken out
of your natural habitat

279
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,197
{\an8}and gawked at by a bunch
of slack-jawed yokels.

280
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,700
Hey, ma, look at that
pointy-hairded little girl. (guffaws)

281
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,914
{\an8}You guys don't
understand Stampy.

282
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,655
{\an8}He's just like me.

283
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,787
{\an8}We're a pair of jokers,
and both of us are wild.

284
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,634
We don't take nothing
from nobody. (sighs)

285
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,130
(laughs)
Smithers!

286
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,763
This reminds me of that fat man
I used to ride to work.

287
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,551
-(groaning)
-(door closes)

288
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,345
Look at this, Marge.
$58 and all of it profit!

289
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,389
I'm the smartest businessman
in the world.

290
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,394
Stampy's food bill
today was $300.

291
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,767
Marge, please, don't humiliate me
in front of the money.

292
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,815
(humming)

293
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,491
(customers reacting
negatively)

294
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,410

tires screeching)

295
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,159
(vehicles departing)

296
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,492
Um, Milhouse saw the elephant
twice

297
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,867
and rode him once, right?

298
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,334
Yes, but we paid you
four dollars.

299
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,134
Well, that was under
our old price structure.

300
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,289
Under our new
price structure,

301
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,878
your bill comes
to a total of $700.

302
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,625
Now, you've already
paid me four dollars,

303
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:08,097
so that's just $696 more
that you owe me.

304
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,180
Get off our property.

305
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,426
This town
is full of deadbeats.

306
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,308
We can't afford this elephant.

307
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,305
No, Dad, he's my friend.

308
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,437
Sorry, Bart.
I'm gonna have to sell him.

{\an8}(roars)

311
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,874
{\an8}Well, sir,
I'll be honest with ya.

312
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,659
I need a large African elephant,
and I need it today.

313
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,714
But I'm afraid this just
isn't what I'm looking for.

314
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,618
What do you mean?
It's an elephant, isn't it?

315
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,287
Well, it is and it isn't,
if you understand what I mean.

316
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,762
He likes peanuts.

317
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,139
Our wildlife refuge is the ideal
environment for your elephant.

318
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,138
Thousands of acres
of simulated African savannah.

319
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,681
It's perfect, Dad.

320
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,644
I only have two questions:
How much? And give it to me.

321
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,936
Well, we really can't
offer you any money.

322
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,190
-We're a nonprofit organization.
-So, your bid is zero?

323
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,443
-Well, we'd like to think of it as--
-Thank you.

324
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,565
-You know, I really think--
-Thank you.

325
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,279
Mr. Simpson, I think you'll find
this amount more than fair.

326
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,905
Dad, I think
he's an ivory dealer.

327
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,123
His boots are ivory.
His hat is ivory.

328
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,583
And I'm pretty sure
that check is ivory.

329
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:19,964
Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory
is less likely to hurt Stampy

330
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,764
than a guy whose
ivory supplies are low.

331
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:27,588
(growling)
We love... you.

00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,534
And, like most people,

338
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,109
yeah, I've dealt
a little ivory.

339
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,324
Dad, you can't do this.
Stampy is my friend.

340
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,905
Don't worry, son.
I'll get you a new elephant.

341
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,201
-I'll take that one too.
-Done.

342
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,285
I'll be back in
the morning to pick up Stampy.

343
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,620
Here's the keys.

344
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,624
-Elephants don't have keys.
-I'll just keep these then.

345
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,917
Don't worry, Stampy.

346
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,711
I won't let Homer sell you
to that ivory dealer.

347
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,546
You and I are gonna
run away together.

348
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,631
We'll keep to the back roads
and make our way south.

349
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,597
Then, if I know my geography,
it's just 12 miles to Africa.

350
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,180
Okay, bud, very quietly,
let's just sneak through--

351
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,265
(grunts)

352
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,810
Stampy!

353
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,483
(trumpets)

354
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,185
(gasps) Oh, it's the four elephants
of the apocalypse.

355
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,145
-That's horsemen, Ned.
-Well, getting closer.

356
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,582
Mom, Dad,
Bart and Stampy are gone!

357
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,540
Oh, my Lord!

358
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,420
I bet it's because of that horrible
ivory dealer, Dad.

359
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,998
He took Bart too?

360
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,793
That wasn't part of
our deal, Blackheart!

361
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,957
That wasn't part!

362
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,297
Piece of cake.

363
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,925
All we have to do is follow
the path of destruction.

364
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,603
Oh, stupid tornado!

365
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,234
(laughs)
Look.

366
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,230
It got Patty and Selma.

367
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,066
(groans) I feel it
all the way up my skirt.

368
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,190
Ditto.

369
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,656
(trumpets)

370
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,609
Whoa!

371
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,117
Whoa!

372
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,209
(chuckles)
Yeah, right, lady.

373
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,830
An elephant ran through
your front yard. Okay.

374
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,337
Wiggum. Yeah, right,
mister. Mm-hmm.

375
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,381
An elephant just knocked over
your mailbox. Okay.

376
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,336
Wiggum.
Yeah, right, buddy.

377
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,637
Liquor store robbery,
officer down. Sure.

378
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,772
And I'm Edward G. Robinson.
Waah!

379
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,523
(cheering)

380
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,606
(trumpeting)

381
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,654
(jeering)

382
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:54,821
(trumpets)

383
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,327
Whoa!

384
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,078
This is the moment
we've feared, people.

385
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,910
Many of you thought
it would never happen,

386
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,495
but I insisted we spend two hours
every morning training for it.

387
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,632
You all thought I was mad.

388
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,459
Many of you requested to be
transferred to another peanut factory.

389
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,545
-But now, we--
-(trumpets)

390
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,845
Stampy!

391
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,849
Stampy, where are
you, boy?

392
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,642
-(trumpeting)
-Huh?

393
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,096
{\an8}(panting)
(trumpeting)

394
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,567
{\an8}FEMALE VOICE:<i> These prehistoric</i>
<i>creatures blundered into the tar pits,</i>

395
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,819
{\an8}<i>which preserved their skeletons</i>
<i>in showroom condition.</i>

396
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,492
Oh. He's gone forever.

397
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,742
(loud trumpeting)

398
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,275
(gasps)
Stampy!

399
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,414
Mm.

400
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,117
Huh?

401
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,127
{\an8}Oh, you're lonely for
other elephants, aren't you?

402
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,764
-D'oh!
-A deer!

403
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,759
A female deer.

404
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,511
Son, you're okay!

405
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,393
And you led us
to the precious ivory.

406
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,721
And, of course, your lovable pet,
who it's connected to.

407
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,348
Dad, I can't let you sell him.
Stampy and I are friends.

408
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,146
Ow!

409
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,020
Anyway, I want him to go
to that animal refuge.

410
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,528
Forget it!

411
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,029
That elephant cost me
thousands of dollars.

412
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,912
Dad, how would you like to be
sold to an ivory dealer?

413
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,910
-I'd like it fine.
-Even if he killed you

414
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,242
and made your teeth
into piano keys?

415
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,037
Yes, of course I would.

416
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,211
Who wouldn't like that,
to be part of the music scene?

417
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,830
-Dad, you're sinking!
-Huh?

418
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,417
-Get a rope, Bart.
-No, that's okay.

419
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,883
I'm pretty sure
I can struggle my way out.

420
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,634
First, I'll just reach in
and pull my legs out.

421
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,718
{\an8}Now I'll pull my arms out
with my face.

422
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,724
{\an8}Mm.
(gurgling)

423
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,226
-Dad!
-Homey!

424
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,189
Stampy, quick!
Pull him out!

425
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,730
Thanks, Stampy.

426
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,279
Ow!

427
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,567
(gasping)

428
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,326
Ah, I'm alive!
I'm alive!

429
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,790
And I owe it all
to this feisty feline.

430
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,792
Dad, feline means cat.

431
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,504
Elephant, honey.
It's an elephant.

432
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,545
And I'm sure he'll make
a grand piano.

433
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,380
-BOTH: Dad!
-Oh.

434
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,926
I guess it wouldn't be
right to sell Stampy

435
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,970
after he saved my life.

436
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,434
And the boy seems to have some
sort of relationship with him.

437
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:27,314
-Thanks, Dad.
-On the other hand,

438
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,652
who's to say
what's right these days,

439
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,478
what with all our modern ideas...
and products?

440
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,900
All right. We'll give the stupid elephant
to the stupid animal refuge.

441
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,777
BOTH: Yea!

442
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,235
Uh, Mom,
we're stuck to Dad.

443
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,867
(groans)

444
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,794
This is just what happened
at the caramel factory.

445
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,212
-Ow!
-Ow, my hair!

446
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,881
(grunting)

447
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,420
Mmm, caramel.

448
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,474
(trumpets)

449
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,428
So long, Stampy.

450
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,429
I know you're gonna like it here.
No, Stampy, no!

451
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,852
(trumpets)

452
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,481
(chuckles)
Oh, thanks, boy.

453
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,899
-(roars)
-Whoa! Whoa, boy!

454
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,859
Wh-whoa!

455
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,740
-(grunts)
-(trumpets)

456
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,159
(Bart laughs)

457
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,451
Attaboy, Stampy.
Butt him once for me.

458
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,996
Gosh, I thought he'd be happier
in his true habitat.

459
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh, I think he is.

460
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,462
Then why is he attacking
all those other elephants?

461
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,843
Well, animals are a lot
like people, Mrs. Simpson.

462
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,591
{\an8}-Some of them act badly
-Stampy!

463
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,843
{\an8}Because they had a hard life
or have been mistreated.

464
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:46,045
But, like people,
some of them are just jerks.

465
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,678
Stop that, Mr. Simpson.

466
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,184
(grunting)

467
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,204
Shh!
