183
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,400
Don't you kids get it?

184
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:36,165
I'm completely invinci...

185
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,535
Whoa! (exclaiming)

186
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,186
Aah!

187
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:49,457

188
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,198
Oh!

190
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,311
Wait, I never
heard that before.

191
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:59,705
Real laughter.
That I actually earned.

192
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,323
Hey, hey, kids,
if you like that,

193
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:03,847
watch this.

194
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:05,524

195
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:08,604

Hey, clown.

200
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:19,752
Why don't you eat these?

201
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:23,594
Oh!
Cherry bombs in the mouth.

202
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:25,164
That's a great gag.

Oh...

204
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,210
So this is what it feels like
not to bomb.

205
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,410
Whoa!

206
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:34,723

207
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:38,356
No, you tricked me!

208
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:41,664
You're nothing
but a bunch of losers.

209
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:43,803
And that's all you'll ever be!

Doesn't-doesn't matter.

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,720
Guys, let's make a pact:

216
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,890
if the clown comes back
in 27 years,

217
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:57,231
no matter where we all end up,

218
00:09:57,227 --> 00:10:00,597
we'll come back home
and finish the job.

219
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:05,806
Now let's find out
if this water is deep enough

220
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:07,951
- for jumpin'!

221
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,621

222
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:12,422
- Mwah.
- Huh?

223
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:14,094
I got your poem.

224
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:18,604
I want my first love to be
the boy who wrote those words.

225
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:21,414
B-By that, you mean me,
of course.

226
00:10:21,408 --> 00:10:23,908
Kiss me
for the rest of the summer.

227
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:28,091
Wait, this isn't right.

228
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:30,829

to fall in love with.

229
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:32,458

Mwah, kissing.

I need to find my courage,

334

335
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:54,986
Poem?

336
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,089

I fell in love with him.

339
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,941

just one...

341

Mommy and Daddy have some
grown-up yelling to discuss.

348
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,491
Mom and Dad's hometown
sure sucks.

349
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:32,429

Salem's parking lot,

360
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:02,417
<i>Dad, get your fat ass
down here!</i>

361
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:03,433
No!

362
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:05,455
(cackles)

363
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,469
Our kids!

364
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,741
Our phones.

365
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:12,811
Now it's personal.

366
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:16,422
Just like it always was.

367
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,725
(grunts)

368
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:24,541
(sniffs) I smell
thousand-year-old flop sweat.

369
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:26,165
We must be close.

370
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:30,005
- LIZZIE: Finally!
- BERT: Mom, Dad!

371
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:31,082
- Up here!
-(gasps)

372
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:33,951
Kids! Oh...

373
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:35,224
Aah!

374
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:38,833
Well, well.
If it isn't the Losers.

375
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,240
Say hello to my studio audience.

376
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,635
(children laughing)

377
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:53,462
There's no laughter
like forced laughter.

378
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,199
We're not afraid of you
anymore, clown.

379
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:58,168
You have no power over us.

380
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:01,238
He's an astronaut,
she's a seltzer big wig,

381
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:03,351
and I'm a world-famous,

382
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,945
um, virgin.

383
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:07,251
Oh, damn it.

384
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:10,663
The point is we've conquered
our childhood fears.

385
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:14,901
Ah, but adults have something
much tastier than fears.

386
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,142
Anxieties.

387
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:18,208
Millions of tiny,

388
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,979
delicious anxieties.

389
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:22,451
(yelps)

390
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,220
Oh!

391
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,264
(screeching)

392
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,860
You know what I'm thankful for?

393
00:17:28,863 --> 00:17:32,473
The filibuster.
Let's talk about it.

394
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,510
ALL:
Aah!

395
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:35,076
-(screeching)
-(all whimpering)

396
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:37,616
But you... you've got something

397
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:40,145
worth worrying about.

398
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:42,062
Why don't I tell Marge

399
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:44,086
you put your name on the poem

400
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,474
that won her heart, eh?

401
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,997
(yelps)

402
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,114
No, no, please.

403
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,048
It-it wasn't you?

404
00:17:53,045 --> 00:17:56,115
I tried to tell you,
just not very hard.

405
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,388
My life is a lie.

406
00:17:58,389 --> 00:17:59,689
Oh...

407
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:04,398
He must get his sinister powers

408
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:06,611
from his captive audience.

409
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:08,436
Just like Jimmy Fallon.

410
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,452
You have to destroy the sign!

411
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:18,258
Only you can do it, Marge.

412
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:20,272
Your arm is summer lightning.

413
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,096
Your bravery, the storm.

414
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,273
You're the chimp in the zoo.

415
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:27,254
And I'm still bananas for you.

416
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:30,216
Now, throw, throw!

417
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:32,961
Hmm?

418
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,798
Ah...

419
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,795
(grunting)

420
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,839
(whimpering)

421
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:41,882
(grunts)

422
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:44,648
No!

423
00:18:48,322 --> 00:18:50,692
Why were we laughing?

424
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,304
This show sucks.

425
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:53,596
Let's go up to heaven

426
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,370
and bask in the glory
of God's stupid love.

427
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:58,411
♪

428
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:01,445
My audience! No!

429
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:03,788
It took me years to grow them.

430
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:05,657
(groans)
Eh?

431
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:08,157
Aah! Oh... Oh!

432
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:10,772
I can't start over! Oh!

433
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:12,097
What would that even look like?

434
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:14,113
(whimpers)

435
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:16,507
Dancing for followers on TikTok?

436
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:17,452
(groans)

437
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,447
I haven't written a joke
since 1647.

438
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,428
Aah!
And that material has not...

439
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:25,625
(exclaiming, grunting):
aged...

440
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,800
well. Oh...

441
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,671
I blame cancel culture.

442
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:35,782
You were finally brave.

443
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:39,594
Does this make up for
lying to you all these years?

444
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,162
Oh, honey.

445
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:42,971
Of course not.

446
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,635
No, I get it. (groans)

447
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:47,914
HOMER:
Mm...

448
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:50,513
<i>Growing up isn't easy.</i>

449
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:53,194
<i>The traumas we lived as kids
can haunt us forever,</i>

450
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,855
<i>lurking in the corners
of our mind.</i>

451
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:57,287
<i>We can't undo the harm,</i>

452
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:59,703
<i>but with a little help,
we can survive it.</i>

453
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:04,208
<i>And live the life
we were always meant to.</i>

454
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:08,947
The humans have vanquished
our thousand-year-old clown,

455
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,460
but surely they will be no match
for our next nightmare...

456
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:15,527
a Saint Bernard with rabies.

457
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,930
Mm...

458
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,443
An angry car?

459
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:21,575
Put that in the "maybe" pile.

460
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:24,816
How about a prom
that goes seriously wrong?

461
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,387
Haunted hotel?

462
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:29,086
What about some Tommyknockers?

463
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,960
Those sound scary.

464
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:33,531
Yes, yes!

465
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,073

00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:39,241
