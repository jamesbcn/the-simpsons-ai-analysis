I'm your dad.

I am going easy on you,

I think the saddest day
of my life

187
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,832
was when I realized I could
beat my dad at most things.

that at the age of four.

Bart's such a handful,

Lisa is becoming a young woman.

Always be yourself.

And when you get finished
feeling sad,

344
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,762
we'll still be there.

345
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,184
From now on,

346
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,852
let me do the smiling

347
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,181
Okay, Mom.

348
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,519
I said you could stop
smiling, Lisa.

349
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,153
I feel like smiling.

350
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,904
I'm gonna knock you out
one more time, and that's it.

351
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,534
This is getting boring, man.

352
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,281
Just try not to kill me
too hard, son.

353
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,541
- Whoa!
- Kid, tonight's not your night.

354
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,771
All right, man, you asked
for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.

355
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,419
Aha! Blocked it.
You missed me.

356
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,420
I got you. Ooh.

357
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,625
Don't try that. I got you blocked.

358
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,126
And the crowd is on its feet

359
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,928
as Hurricane Homer moves in
for the kill!

360
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,801
Boys, I'd like
your attention, please.

361
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,138
Quiet, Marge!
This is my big moment!

362
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,874
Bart "The Bloody Pulp"
Simpson is on the ropes.

363
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,062
He is hoping I'll put him
out of his misery!

364
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,614
Well, you're in luck, Bart!
Here comes my right!

365
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,279
No!

366
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,949
My game, my game!

367
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,818
I could have beat the boy.

368
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,945
Marge, how could you?
I was so close.

369
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,293
I'm sorry,
but this is more important

370
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,579
than that silly, loud game.

371
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,962
You're right, Mom.
I'd just like to

372
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,389
use this occasion
to announce my retirement,

373
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,165
undefeated, from the world
of video boxing.

374
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,749
Calm down, Homer.

375
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,667
Lisa has an idea that she thinks

376
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,416
would be fun
for the whole family.

377
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,141
The next song was written
by a friend of mine,

378
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,141
one of the great
little ladies of jazz.
