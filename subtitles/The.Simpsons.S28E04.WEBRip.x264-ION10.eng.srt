179
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,895
But I only wore that with Rachel.

180
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,400
Who's Rachel?

181
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,901
And tell me it's not a computer acronym

182
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:33,074
like Repeating Algorithm
for Calculating Hotel...

183
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,865
Come on, Lou, help me out here.

184
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,289
No, no, no.
You got yourself into that acronym.

185
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,868
You can, uh, get yourself out.

186
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,753
Lou stands for lousy, obstinate, um...

187
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,422
Uh, help me out here, Lou.

188
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,590
I had no real friends.

189
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,509
<i>So I played with</i>
<i>my imaginary friend, Rachel.</i>

190
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,219
<i>We did it all together.</i>

191
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,299
<i>I was maid of honor</i>
<i>at her imaginary wedding.</i>

192
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,385
<i>But then I outgrew her.</i>

193
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,057
(Bart humming)

194
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:08,649
And I never saw Rachel
or wore this nail polish again.

195
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,243
That's a nice story, kid, but, uh,
we're keeping our eye on you.

196
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,410
Only invisible killer I believe in is God.

197

198
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,293

199
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,080
(gasping)

200
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,884
I'm not afraid to be around you.

201
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,835
<i>Hello... best friend.</i>

202
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,800
(gasps)

203
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,677
No, no, please.

204
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,759
(gagging)

205
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,850
Why did Mom double-wrap?

206
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,981
(groans)

207
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,979
How could you do that?

208
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,311
<i>You tell me. I came from your brain,</i>

209
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>where your darkest thoughts live.</i>

210
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,113
(dissonant notes playing)

211
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,493
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

212
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,834
(siren wailing)

213
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,329
I didn't do it.

214
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,330
Plastic wrap doesn't lie.

215
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,172
Except on the box,
where it says "easy tear-off."

216
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,791
<i>Hey, Lisa, let's gossip about boys.</i>

217
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,877
<i>Isn't Milhouse so cute?</i>

218
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,172
<i>Oh, of course, he suffocated.</i>

219
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,966
My mom was so right when she said
I didn't need you anymore.

220
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,722
<i>Oh. Oh, I see.</i>

221
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,394
<i>So, nosy old Marge was the reason</i>

222
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,523
<i>you-- you moved on from me.</i>

223
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,605
(gasps) Oh, no.

224
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,940
She'll kill Mom. What do I do?

225
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,065
You can keep quiet
and let me get you out of here.

226
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,572
(gasps) Bart! You came to save me?

227
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,235
Actually, I deliver
little bags to guys inside.

228
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,664
Don't know what's in 'em,
but they're sure glad to see me.

229
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,583
-Come on, let's go.
-Yo, could you please keep it down?

230
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,043
Some of us are trying to shiv.

231
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,464
Tell Ralphie I won't be home for dinner.

232
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,553
Uh, tell him that dinner is the meal
at the end of the day.

233
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,919
Uh, tell him the end of the day
is when the sun goes down.

234
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,127
Tell him...

235
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,837
Oh, thank you, thank you.

236
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,217
(Marge humming a tune)

237
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,142

238
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,442

239
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,533

00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,782

-(harmonicas wheezing)

241
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,446
God, those have so much drool.

242
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,535
Come on, we got to save Mom.

243
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,120
Come on, imagine a motorcycle
to get us out of here.

244
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,286
My imagination isn't that powerful.

245
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,835
You imagined a girl
that's killing everyone in town.

246
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,589
Good point.

247
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,724
Where do I sit?

248
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,340
(muttering)

249
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,427
Safety first.

250
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,314
And it runs on pony smiles.

251
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,482
Oh, man, you ruin everything.

252
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,282
LISA: Rachel, no!

253
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,779
Why can't a real person
like me this much?

254
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,074
<i>I'm going to kill everyone you love.</i>

255
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,748
<i>And they'll blame you</i>
<i>because nobody else can see me.</i>

256
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,708
I can see you.

257
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,129
Because I am incredibly wasted.

258
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,052
Hey... (gagging)

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,170

262
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,890

Aah!

271
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,205
Rachel, you have to go.

272
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,916
I can turn you into
the worst thing you can imagine--

273
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,717
your mother.

274
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,221
<i>No! You'll be sorry, Lisa.</i>

275
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,813
<i>I'm the truest friend you've ever had.</i>

276
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,929
I'll have friends in college.

277
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,186
And you'll be married to a dentist.

278
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,400
<i>We'll spend every vacation</i>
