{\an8}Ugh! Salisbury soup again?

00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,699
{\an8}My joe isn't sloppy enough.

8
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,004
{\an8}And talk about weak coffee.

9
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,078
{\an8}I'll take that.

10
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,829
{\an8}What are they doing with our 45 cents?

00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,338
{\an8}I bought my lunch at the gas station.

00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,482
{\an8}-Got it!
-Is this it?

20
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,483
{\an8}Excellent, Milhouse.

21
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,565
{\an8}How 'bout this?

22
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,899
{\an8}Nice work, Bart.

23
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,034
{\an8}How 'bout you, Lisa?

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,570
{\an8}I'll get it in a second. Don't worry.

25
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,525
{\an8}Oh! Of course.

26
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,156
{\an8}It's-- (whispering)

27
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,658
{\an8}Yeah! Champion of the world!

28
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,456
{\an8}Answer this, Professor.

{\an8}(grunting)

30
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,248
{\an8}Hey! Some of us
are still trying to solve it.

31
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,456
{\an8}Just you.

32
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,915
{\an8}Maybe I can't concentrate
because of all your cooties!

33
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,677
{\an8}It's called lice. And it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,681

LISA: OK, let's see. It's not Egyptian.

37
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,943
{\an8}-It's not Prince's names.

00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,744
-Want a hint?
-I don't need a hint, Ralph.

40
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,359
But you're suffering.

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,119
(Lisa groans)

42
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,592
{\an8}So, Lisa. Did you get
that brainteaser yet?

43
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,879
{\an8}For your information,
none of your business.

44
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,093
{\an8}You look tired. Are ya tired, Lisa?

45
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,088
{\an8}(sighs) If you're suggesting
I stayed up all night

46
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,757
{\an8}trying to solve that childish puzzle,

47
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,522
you're right.

48
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,808
-(clatter)
-Ah. Now I can't remember my combination.

49
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,281
{\an8}Look at my "aggie-culture" project.

50
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,938
{\an8}It's a piece of a cow.

51
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,896
(gasps) The project.
I forgot all about it.

52
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,118
Very nice, Janie.
Good use of pipe cleaners, Becky.

53
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,659
(buzzing)

54
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,542
Don't open it, Ralph.
I'll just give you a C-minus.

55
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,790
Yay!

56
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:48,252
-Not finished, Lisa?
-I'm finished. I just got to--

57
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,594
(grunts) There. It's a pig!

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,590
It's an eraser with pushpins.

59
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,672
And a spring for his curly tail.

60
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,757
(laughs) Oink, oink, oink.

61
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,513
This is terrible at best.
I'm surprised at you, Lisa.

62
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,969
Me too.

63
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:10,108
{\an8}Oh, it looks like somebody's
"hogging Dazs" ice cream.

64
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,530
{\an8}(laughs) I should write this down.

65
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,899
{\an8}-More coming.
-(door dings)

66
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,815
{\an8}Um, I'm looking for something
in an after-dinner burrito.

67
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,991
You'll have it in 45 seconds, sir.

68
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,076
(beeping)

69
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:28,115
To pass the time,
please enjoy this novelty pen.

70
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,788
Why would I want to
look at a pen with a-- (gasps)

71
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,590
Oh, no! Her clothes are coming off!

72
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,841
(chuckles) Hey, you know
who would love this?

73
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,005
Men.

74
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:42,102
Five, four, three, two, one.

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,260
Liftoff!

76
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,728
(moans)

77
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,063
Look at this mess.
Where is that elderly old man?

78
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,361
Old man! Old m--

79
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,611
(screams)

80
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,157
Hey, look. A freezer man!

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,450
-Wait a minute. There is a note.
-Oh.

82
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:08,082
"I have frozen myself so I may live to see
the wonders of the future.

83
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,334
Thaw me out when robot wives
are cheap and effective.

84
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,877
P.S. Please alter my pants
as fashion dictates."

85
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,470
(saxophone playing)

86
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,628
(off-key)

87
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,722
Now you're swinging, honey.

88
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,434
(scatting off-key)

89
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:32,943
Darn it!

90
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,699
Oh, no! No, no!

91
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,158
The George Raft look is dead.

92
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,029
I wanted Audie Murphy!

93
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,196
If you would just apologize to Louie,

94
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,075
you could get your hair cut
the way you want.

95
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,911
No apology! Not until he admits
he's a jerk!

96
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,788
Mom, I think something's wrong with me.

97
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,626
I can't do anything right lately.

98
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,972
You're just having a bad day.
I had one last week.

99
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,678
I burned the roast. My cake fell.

100
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,969
And I ran out of butter, so I had to spray
the English muffins with PAM.

101
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,434
Maybe you're just a lousy cook. Ow!

102
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,555
MARGE: I'll go get the Bactine.

103
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,392
It can't just be a bad day.

104
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,687
I feel like I'm getting
dumber by the minute.

105
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,361
Oh, ain't no big deal.

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,820
All Simpsons start to lose
their smarts around your age.

107
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,531
-What are you talking about?
-Well, I'll show ya.

108
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,952
Follow me.

109
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,987
Wow! Dad was a good speller?

110
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,037
Oh, your dad used to be smart as a monkey.

111
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,422
Then his mind started getting lazy

112
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,419
and now he's dumb as a chimp.

113
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,711
-Grampa!
-Hey, I am, too.

114
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,875
{\an8}Your brother's coming along nicely.
Look at Bart's homework.

115
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,676
Back when he was your age,
he was smart as a chimp.

116
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,351
(gasps) This is just two years ago!

117
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,390
That's right. Then the Simpson genes
kicked in.

118
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,895
This is crazy. Just because you and Dad
and Bart went downill

119
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,148
doesn't mean it's gonna happen to me.

120
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,780
-Does it?
-Sure!

121
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,742
But it doesn't mean you can't live a long
and pointless life.

122
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,736
(groans)

123
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,792
Dear Log, can it be true?

124
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,294
Do all Simpsons go through
a process of "dumbening"?

125
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,088
Wait. That's not how
you spell "dumbening."

126
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,257
Wait. "Dumbening" isn't even a word!

127
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,258
Ugh.

128
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,970
(groans) I've got to find out more.

129
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,966
(voices shouting)

130
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,098
(grunting, laughing)

131
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,056
That makes 22 to 16.

132
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,065
Time is running out.

133
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,739
(Dr. Hibbert laughing) So you're worried
about your genes, huh?

134
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,661
Well, does it hurt when you go like this?

135
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,080
-No.
-Then will you turn

136
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,158
this projector on for me?

137
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,203
I think the film should answer
all your questions.

138
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,884
(introductory music plays)

139
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,549
MCCLURE (narrating): <i>Have you ever</i>
<i>wondered why fat parents have fat children</i>

140
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,009
<i>or why Chinese parents</i>
<i>have Chinese children?</i>

141
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,471
It's no coincidence. It's because of

142
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,222
D.N.A.

143
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,222
Hi. I'm Troy McClure.

144
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,847
-(alarm blares)
-(men shouting)

145
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:24,281
You may remember me from such medical
films as <i>Alice Doesn't Live Anymore</i>

146
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,030
and <i>Mommy, What's Wrong</i>
<i>with that Man's Face?</i>

147
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,163
But, Mr. McClure, what is D.N.A.?

148
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,031
What the-- Oh, hi, Billy.

149
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,948
Let's find out together.

150
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,536
D.N.A. is God's recipe for making you.

151
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,633
(soundtrack music stuttering)

152
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,086
You take a dash of Dad, a pinch of Mom...

153
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,513
then we bake for nine months, and--

154
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,474
Mmm. That's good Billy.

155
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,973
Mr. McClure, what does D.N.A. stand for?

156
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,691
(stuttering)

157
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,773
That didn't answer anything.

158
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,566
-I need more information.
-Would you like to see it again?

159
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,780
Isn't there any way I can change my D.N.A.

160
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,911
like sitting on the microwave?

161
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,818
Hmm. Not according to any movie
I've ever seen.

162
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,158
I'm afraid you're stuck
with your genes, Lisa.

163
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,164
(chuckling)

164
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,671
-(door dings)
-Hi, frozen body.

165
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,426
-(thumps)
-Hmm. He's got a lob...

166
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,509
but I don't hear a dob.

167
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,854
-(thumps)
-Oh. Uh, there it is.

168
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,600
You're lucky he's still alive.

169
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,101
This freezer is an attractive nuisance.

170
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,404
Just look at all that ice cream.
It's damn near irresistible.

171
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,109
Well, we better leave him in there.

172
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,189
Moving him now could kill him
and tire us out.

173
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,315
NELSON: Check it out!

174
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,951
-A freezer geezer.
-Please, young customers,

175
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,699
ignore the frozen gentleman,
and return to your impulse buying.

176
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,583
Aw, but we wanna stare at the ice dude.

177
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,621
-We'll give ya a buck.
-No. This is a convenience store...

178
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,416
not a freak show.

179
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
$1.20?

180
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,921
-(carnival music playing)
-Come one, come all.

181
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,126
See the amazing frozen man.

182
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:16,137
Also gaze at the Frito
found in a bag of Doritos.

183
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,312
Marvel at the floor
that just won't come clean!

184
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,192
(thinking) <i>Dear Log, my worst fears</i>
<i>have been confirmed.</i>

185
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,361
<i>I've hit my mental and creative peak</i>
<i>at the tender age of eight.</i>

186
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,651
<i>What will my life be like after I descend</i>
<i>into mediocrity?</i>

187
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,606
-(clank)
-(laughing)

188
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,986
Oh.

189
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,334
-(clank)
-(laughing)

190
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,661
(thinking) <i>Well, Ralph seems happy enough.</i>

191
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:45,076
<i>Maybe I should just give up now</i>
<i>and settle into a mindless, happy stupor.</i>

192
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,130
ANNOUNCER 1 (on TV): <i>We now return to</i>

193
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:51,131
When Buildings Collapse <i>on Nonstop Fox.</i>

194
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,965
-(building collapses)
-(Homer and Bart laughing)

195
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,090
(cheering)

196
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,636
-(Bart and Homer whooping)
-(groans)

197
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,233
Hey, Lise, wanna join us?

198
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,475
Room for one more.

199
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,488
We're watching the TV.

200
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,913
NARRATOR (on TV): <i>Man has always loved</i>
<i>his buildings.</i>

201
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,503
<i>But what happens when the buildings say,</i>
<i>"No more"?</i>

202
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,210
(triumphant music plays)

203
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,456
HOMER: Yes! (laughs)

204
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,594
-(both laughing)
-HOMER: Oh! Ooh!

205
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,588
Yeah! (laughing)

206
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,426
(cheering)

207
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,101
{\an8}HOMER: I didn't think
it was gonna fall over.

208
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,348
{\an8}-Yeah!
-Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

209
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,104
(show ends)

210
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,806
The best part was
when the buildings fell down.

211
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,477
Yeah. Ha. Maybe people got hurt.

212
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,067
Hey, yeah. (chortling)

213
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,243
{\an8}ANNOUNCER 2 (on TV): <i>And now,</i>
<i>a Channel 6 editorial reply.</i>

214
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,873
(singsong) Boring!

215
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,332
ANNOUNCER 3 (on TV): <i>And now,</i>
When Surgery Goes Wrong.

216
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,713
All right. Sounds good.

217
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,500
(carnival music playing)

218
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,587
-Behold the can of mystery!
-(crowd murmurs)

219
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,804
{\an8}The label vanished many years ago.

220
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,925
What strange wonders lie inside?

221
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,353
Treasure, dog food?

222
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:27,272
Whoa! Some things man
is not meant to know.

223
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,318
ROD AND TODD (reading): "Show me your"--

224
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,954
-Hey!
-Hey!

225
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,118
It says, "Show me your tie."
It's cute. Come on. Let's go.

226
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,538
Me and Frostillicus go back a long way.

227
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,619
I used to share a bathroom
with Frostillicus.

228
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:51,206
In fact, I got
a real funny story about that.

229
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,463
Actually, it's not
so much funny as it is long.

230
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,547
It seems that there was this...

231
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,012
Whoo! What a gold mine!

232
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,385
(gasps) Oh, my goodness!

233
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,597
(whistling)

234
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,228
Boy, seeing that
stomach surgery made me hungry.

235
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,896
Marge, we need
5,000 c.c.'s of snacks, stat!

236
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,947
No snacks. Dinner will be ready
in three minutes.

237
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,581
(all three groaning)

238
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:26,408
If she started dinner three minutes
earlier, we wouldn't be in this mess.

239
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,075
BART: Relax, Lise.

240
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,964
Dad and I always have a plan "B."

241
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,340
(gulping, chewing)

242
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,591
Pretty neat, huh?

243
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,182
But those candy bars
are all squished and melted.

244
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,965
-Wha--
-Wha--

245
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,604
(muffled) Come on, Lisa. Join your family.

246
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,555
(whimpering)

247
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,070
-(kids crying)
-Quit it!

248
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,816
-Quit it.
-(dog barking)

249
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,988
(in Southern accent)
Quit-- You kids knock it off.

250
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,946
Mama's watching her stories.

251
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,457
(fly buzzing)

252
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,251
Hi, honey. It's me, your husband, Ralph.

253
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,254
Hey, angel pie. Can you drive me down
to the libarry?

254
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,547
I wanna rent us up some movies.

255
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,878
(groaning)

256
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,637
Wesley, get mama's pryirng bar.

257
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,431
Easy does it now. Easy. Little more.

258
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,636
Yeah... right... that's the spot.

259
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,476
-(grunts)
-I'll get your coat.

260
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,524
-(normal accent) No!
-No what?

261
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,186
-I don't wanna turn out that way.
-What way, angel pie?

262
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,526
Like you!

263
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,408
Lisa, come on.

264
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,497
Your tomato soup is getting a skin on top.

265
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,793
Fine. She doesn't get her skin.

266
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,919
Lisa insulted us, Mom.

267
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,844
She thinks she is so great.

268
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,933
I'll dance on her grave.

269
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,968
-Bart!
-What? Oh, napkin. Right.

270
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,813
(thinking) <i>Dear Log, it won't be long now</i>
<i>before my mind melts</i>

271
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,310
<i>into a soft, Simpsony sludge.</i>

272
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,103
<i>Soon, the arts and literature</i>
<i>I love will be replaced</i>

273
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,017
<i>by talk radio and vulgar mud flaps.</i>

274
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,397
<i>It's time to give my brain its last meal.</i>

275
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,946
{\an8}Oh, Kenny. Look at the interplay
of light and shadow.

276
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,365
It's so luminous and vibrant!

277
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,504
(laughs) Thanks, Lisa. I painted that one.

278
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,383
(lowers voice)
The real one's in my garage.

279
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,593
(violin plays)

280
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,845
Hmm. Sounds like she's hitting a baby
with a cat.

281
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,969
You have to listen
to the notes she's not playing.

282
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,477
(scoffs) I can do that at home.

283
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,190
(door dings)

284
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,150
Son, I represent a group of oil tycoons
who make foolish purchases.

285
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,943
We already bought us
a stained glass bathrobe

286
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,448
and the world's fattest racehorse.

287
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,910
Now we need your Ice Man.

288
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,741
Oh, no. I could never sell him.

289
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,746
He's like a frozen father to me.

290
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:16,498
-How much for just the head?
-(cracking)

291
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,292
(Jasper moans)

292
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,424
By gum, it worked.
I've awakened in the future.

293
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,546
"Moon Pie."

294
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,678
What a time to be alive.

295
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,524
Hey, who unplugged my freezer?

296
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,600
Return to your state
of living death at once, sir.

297
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,096
Is that you, Apu?

298
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,648
Whoa! Time has ravaged
your once-youthful looks.

299
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,236
-(door dings)
-(grunts)

300
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:52,082
Ah, well, Sanjay. That is the end
of our freak show.

301
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,249
We must relinquish the giddy glamour
of show business

302
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,119
and return to the humble pleasures
of the neighborhood shopkeeper.

303
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,091
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

304
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,918
<i>♪ That's the way,</i>
<i>uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it ♪</i>

305
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,054

306
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,681
Come on in!

307
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,267
{\an8}-Great set.
-Oh, thanks.

308
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,889
But the crowd kept looking at me like

309
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,016
I was using too many augmented ninths.

310
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,523
Aw, they just came for the buffalo wings.

311
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,435
But you really got through to me.

312
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,824
Oh, good. I figure if you've got
something special to say,

313
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,782
you have to share it with the world.

314
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,742
Yeah. While you still can. Thanks.

315
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,025
(running footsteps)

316
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,118
Damn. That felt like a sale.

317
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:42,628
I'm sorry, little girl.
We don't just put people on TV.

318
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,053
Unless, of course, they're replying
to an editorial.

319
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,339
Uh, I am! I'm strongly opposed to...

320
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,755
Proposition, uh, 305!

321
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,925
You're against discount
bus fares for war widows?

322
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,555
-Uh, you bet I am.
-OK. Makeup.

323
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:03,273
I'm getting worried about Lisa.
She's been gone for hours.

324
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,815
If I were her, I'd be buying me
a great big chocolate apology cake.

325
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,950
<i>Authorities believe</i>
<i>the wave of towel snappings will get worse</i>

<i>And now, with an editorial reply,</i>

335
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,934
So before that happens,

336
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,060
I want to share some things
with you that have meant a lot to me.

337
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,058
What is she doir out there?
I'll cut off her mike.

338

No, no, no. Let her speak.

To Kill a Mockingbird, Harriet the Spy
<i>and </i>Yertle the Turtle,

341
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,485
possibly the best book ever written
on the subject of turtle stacking.

342
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,072
She's got that right.

343
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,697
<i>Beauty is all around us, and not just</i>
<i>in pageants and parlors.</i>

344
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,906
<i>You can find it in the swirl of galaxies</i>

345
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,536
<i>or the swirl in the center of a sunflower.</i>

346
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,504
That's a good idea. Let's go out
for some frosty swirls.

347
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,245
Homer, your daughter
is pouring her heart out.

348
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,218
-We'll tape it.
-Why's she saying all this? Is she dying?

349
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,299
Oh, she's just upset 'cause I told her
her brains turning to mush.

350
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,756
You know, on account of the Simpson gene.

351
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,137
Simpson gene? That's just foolishness!

352
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,766
No. Baldness, too.

353
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,023
<i>So please, I beg you,</i>
<i>don't take your brain for granted.</i>

354
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,898
<i>It's the best friend you'll ever have.</i>

355
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,661
(clears throat)
<i>Little girl... likes her brain.</i>

356
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,414
<i>What's your opinion?</i>

357
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,543
(scoffs) Simpson gene.

358
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,000
Somebody's gotta set that girl straight

359
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,961
and I know how to do it.

360
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,127
Marge, get me your address book,

361
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,801
four beers and my conversation hat.

362
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,892
-(snoring)
-Lisa. Lisa, honey, wake up.

363
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,351
(yawns) Why bother?

364
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,311
Because your father
has a big surprise for you.

365
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,443
-I'm adopted?
-Better. Come look.

366
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,774
Lisa, it's me, Daddy. Your father.

367
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,068
I rounded up every Simpson
in the tri-city area

368
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,243
so I can prove to you there's nothing
wrong with the Simpson genes.

369
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,329
This is your great-uncle Chet.

370
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,199
Go ahead, Chet. Tell her what you do.

371
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,326
I run an unsuccessful shrimp company.

372
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,634
Oh. But... you run it, right?

373
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,919
-Oh, yeah.
-OK.

374
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,673
Uh, this is your second-cousin Stanley.

375
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,175
Um, I shoot birds at the airport.

376
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,298
Everybody hates birds, right?

377
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,307
(whimpers) Well,
you look pretty successful.

378
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,980
Thanks. I play a millionaire at parties.

379
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,944
At least I'd like to.

380
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,771
You probably should have
researched this first, eh, Dad?

381
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,572
What about you?

382
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,781
Well, sir, I step in front of cars
and sue the drivers.

383
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,568
I beg celebrities for money.

384
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,526
-I'm a prison snitch.
-Jug band manager.

385
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,328
-My legs hurt.
-(groans)

386
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:10,292
Oh, Lisa's right. We're nothing
but a big bunch of losers.

387
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,535
Show's over, folks. Go home!

388
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,168
What about our five bucks?

389
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,134
You get it after you leave.
Now get outta here.

390
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,085
(voices mumbling)

391
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,835
Wait a minute, Homer.
You didn't ask everybody.

392
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,888
What about the women?

393
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,350
Fine, fine.

394
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,056
What do you do, "Dr. Simpson"?

395
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,352
-Doctor?
-That's right.

396
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,646
I'm Chief of Complicated Surgery
at the InvasiCare Clinic.

397
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,611
That means you went to college, right?

398
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,438
You have to
if you want to be an architect.

399
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,237
Or an environmental lawyer.

400
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,491
Or Regional Sales Coordinator
for the third largest distributor...

401
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,414
of bunk and trundle beds.

402
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,163
Oh! Did you hear that, Lisa?

403
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,956
So all the Simpson women turn out OK.

404
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,171
That's right, sweetie.

405
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,881
The defective Simpson gene
is on the "Y" chromosome,

406
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,552
so only men are affected.

407
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,005
(both growling)

408
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,928
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

409
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,300
So I'm not doomed!

410
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,354
Oh, Dad, I've never been happier
to be your daughter!

411
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,194
Oh, thanks, honey. Remember...

412
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,231
there's nothing that says you can't be
a Simpson and a success.

413
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,436
Unless you're a man.

414
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,896
So wait a minute.
This means I'm gonna be a failure?

415
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:25,238
Yes, son. A spectacular failure.

416
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,243
(grunts)

417
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,458
{\an8}(Lisa thinking)
<i>Dearest Log, I am me again!</i>

418
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,999
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>there's nothing I can't do.</i>

419
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,342
Except this stupid braintea--

420
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,473
(gasps)

421
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,223
I got it! Whoo-hoo!

422
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,102
I mean, splendid.

423
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,646
(theme music playing)

424
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,647
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

425
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,112
