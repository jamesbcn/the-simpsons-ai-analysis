Aah!

3
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,759
Now class, I don't want
this field trip to be

4
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,096
a repeat of our infamous visit

5
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,351
to the Springfield State Prison.

6
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,143
So, I want you all
to be on your best behavior,

7
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,108
especially you, Bart Simpson.

8
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,018
Mrs. Krabappel,
I didn't unlock that door.

9
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:54,111
Sorry, little dudes.

10
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,777
Party hardy was tardy.

11
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,116
- All right, children. Count off.
- One, two, three.

- Hey, Otto. Hey, Ottoman.
- Hey, Bart dude.

13
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,376
Any new tattoos, Otto?

14
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,378
Funny you should ask, man.

15
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,130
This morning I woke up
with this one.

00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,513
Cool. I want one.

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,050
Not till you're 14,
my little friend.

18
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,769
Bart! Bart Simpson!

19
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,850
Take your seat, Bart.

20
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,345
Please, Mrs. Krabappel,
not next to Wendell.

21
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,767
He pukes on every bus ride.
No offense, Wendell.

Be that as it may,
it's the only seat left,

so get in there!

24
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,948
Please try not to shake
the seat like that.

25
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,076
Now, class, remember.

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,423
Do not stick any part
of your body out the window.

27
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,418
We all know the tragic story
of the young man

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,880
who stuck his arm out the window

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,840
and had it ripped off by a big truck
coming in the other direction.

30
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,131
And I was that boy.

31
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,716
Bart Simpson, sit down!

32
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,852
I've had just about enough
of your tomfoolery.

33
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,427
I don't feel so hot.

34
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,621
Look, there's our school again.

35
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:32,247
- Otto, are you sure you...
- It's a shortcut, Mrs. K. Trust me.

36
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,256
Mrs. Krabappel!
Mrs. Krabappel!

37
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,931
Bart, not another word out of you,

38
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,589
or I'll subject you
to the humiliation

39
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,677
of making you sing
in front of the class.

40
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,973
- Can I pick the song?
- No.

41
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,057
The song will be "John Henry
Was a Steel Drivin' Man."

42
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,233
No.

43
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,562

Hey, Wendell,
you made it, buddy.

57
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,824
And so, this plant harnesses
the power of the atom

58
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,525
so that we have the energy

59
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,695
to run everything from
your favorite video game

60
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,704
to yummy cotton candy machines.

61
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,459
Let's learn more about
nuclear energy, shall we?

62
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,461
Lights.

63
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,585
When most people
think of nuclear energy,

64
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,634
they think of this.

65
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,848
But when we talk about
nuclear energy,

66
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,930
we really mean this.

67
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,398
But what exactly
is nuclear energy?

68
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,268
I don't know,
but I know someone who does.

69
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,646
- Smilin' Joe Fission.
- Hi, there, energy eaters.

70
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,315
I'm Smilin' Joe Fission,
your atomic tour guide...

71
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,914
to the strange and exciting world
of nuclear power.

72
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,241
And these are rods
of uranium 235. Hi, Rod.

73
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,868
Hi. Hey. Good to see ya.

74
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,365
Hey, you guys look hot.

75
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,137
- Of course we're hot.
- We're radioactive.

76
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,337
Well, how 'bout
a dip in the pool?

77
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,759
Yeah!
Last one in's the rotten rod!

78
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,839
The rods make the water
so hot it boils.

79
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,425
Ouch!

80
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,761
And the steam spins turbines

81
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,807
that generate energy.

82
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,811
Bart, sit down.

83
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,353
Whoops.

84
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,477
Looks like there's a little leftover
nuclear waste. No problem.

85
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:02,065
I'll just put it where nobody'll find it
for a million years.

86
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,532
So, now you know the whole true story
of nuclear energy,

87
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,526
our no longer
misunderstood friend.

88
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,248
So, keep on smilin'.

89
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,922
Now, let's have even more fun.

90
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,811
And, over here is
our thermal regulator.

91
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,139
To your right, if you look
through this window,

92
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,145
you'll see where our water rejoins the rest
of nature's biosphere.

93
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,525
Hey, Bart, our dad says
your dad is incompetent.

94
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,360
What does incompetent mean?

95
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,275
It means he spends more time

96
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,124
yakking and scarfing down
doughnuts than doing his job.

97
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay. I thought
you were putting him down.

98
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,959
You know, I defy anyone
to tell the difference

99
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,881
between these doughnuts
and ones baked today.

100
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,052
My boy's supposed to be here
any second on a field trip.

101
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,472
They been through here yet?

102
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,550
Come on, Simpson.

103
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,594
If they wanted the kids
to see you sitting around

104
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,218
on your butt and stuffin' your face,

105
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,224
they'd take them
on a tour of your house.

106
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,516
You're right.
I gotta get where the action is.

107
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,481
Comin' through!

108
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,772
Hey, there's my dad.

109
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:24,686
Hey, Dad! Yo, Homer!
Woo! Woo! I'm up here!

110
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,527
Hi, boy!

111
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,286
All right.
Who's responsible for this?

112
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,520
I might have known it
was you, Simpson.

113
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,593
But, sir, I...

114
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,669
I don't want to hear
about it, Simpson. You're fired!

115
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,545
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Daddy.

116
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,188
Here's a good job
at the fireworks factory.

117
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,777
Those perfectionists?
Forget it.

118
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,362
How 'bout this?

119
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,367
Supervising technician
at the toxic waste dump.

120
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm no supervising technician. I'm a
technical supervisor.

121
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:19,365
I've never done anything
worthwhile in my life.

122
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,537
I'm a big, worthless nothing.

123
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,376
There, there, Homer.
You'll find a job.

124
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,382
You've caused plenty
of industrial accidents,

125
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,094
and you've always bounced back.

126
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,054
- Yeah, Dad, you can do it!
- Yeah, go for it, Dad.

127
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,215
You're right! I'm young,
I'm able-bodied,

128
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,104
and I'll take anything!

129
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,481
Watch out, Springfield.
Here I come.

130
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,284
Don't give up, Dad.

131
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:51,569
I'm just a technical supervisor
who cared too much.

132
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,156
- Moe's Tavern.
- Is Mr. Freely there?

133
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,912
- Who?
- Freely. First initials "I.P."

134
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,964
Hold on.
I'll check.

135
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,538
Is I.P. Freely here?

136
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,545
Hey, everybody!
I.P. Freely!

137
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,344
Wait a minute.
Listen to me, ya lousy bum.

138
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,297
When I get a hold of you, you're dead.

slice your heart in half.

You'll get that
punk someday, Moe.

141
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,270
I don't know.

142
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,146
He's tough to catch.
He keeps changing his name.

143
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,654

cover me just this once?

146
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,990
No, sorry.

147
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,446
W-Why not?

148
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,116
I think after all these years
I deserve an explanation.

149
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,205
I don't think you're
ever gonna get another job

150
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,881
and be able to pay me back.

151
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,499
Don't worry.

00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,341
You sat around the house
all day, but now it's Duff time.

175
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,682
Duff, the beer that makes
the days fly by.

176
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,639
♪ Can't get enough
of that wonderful Duff ♪

177
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,430
- ♪ Duff beer ♪
- Beer.

178
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,854
Now there's
a temporary solution.

179
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,267
There must be
some beer here somewhere.

180
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,274
Maybe in here.

181
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,528
Damn! I need money!

182
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,959
No.
What have I done?

183
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,835
I smashed open my little
boy's piggy bank, and for what?

184
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,844
A few measly cents.

185
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,676
Not even enough to buy one beer.

186
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,562
Wait a minute.

187
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,729
Let me count and make sure.
Not even close.

188
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,982
Dear family.

189
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:17,074
I am an utter failure,
and you'll be better off without me.

190
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:22,163
By the time you read this,
I will be in my watery grave.

191
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,201
I can only leave you with the words
my father gave me:

192
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:31,167
"Stand tall, have courage
and never give up."

193
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,800
I only hope I can provide
a better model...

194
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,799
in death than I did in life.

195
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,971
Warmest regards.

196
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,510
Love, Homer J. Simpson.

197
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,673
Nothing's easy.

198
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,483
Looks like young Simpson
is going to kill himself.

199
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,188
Well, maybe not.

200
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,098
Maybe he's just taking
his boulder for a walk.

201
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,284
- Mom! Mom! Wake up!
- We've been robbed!

202
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,740
- What?
- Someone swiped my piggy bank!

203
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,032
Your father's gone too!

204
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,905
Look what I found.

205
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,746
Almost there.

206
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,881
Hey, you idiot!
Watch where you're going!

207
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,473
Well, live and learn.

208
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,433
There he is!
Don't do it, Dad!

209
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,855
Boy, this intersection
is dangerous.

210
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,991
Someone ought to put
a stop sign here.

211
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,490
Homer.

212
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,703
How could you think
of killing yourself?

213
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,333
We love you.

214
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,620
- Yeah, Dad. We love you.
- Yeah.

215
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,834
Kill myself?

216
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,873
Killing myself is
the last thing I'd ever do.

217
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,247
Now I have a purpose,
a reason to live.

218
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,335
I don't care who I have to face.

219
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,591
I don't care
who I have to fight.

220
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:47,553
I will not rest until
this street gets a stop sign!

221
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,352
Next on the agenda.
Police Chief Wiggum

222
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,604
will give us an update
on our graffiti problem.

223
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,436
Well, it's no secret
our city is under siege

224
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,362
by a graffiti vandal
known as "El Barto."

225
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,742
Police artists have
a composite sketch of the culprit.

226
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,200
If anyone has any information,
please contact us immediately.

227
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,123
Cool, man.

228
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,252
Tough customer.

229
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,309
Ooh, wouldn't want to run
into him in a dark alley.

230
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,291
And now, new business.

231
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,344
Homer Simpson, local resident,
has something. Mr. Simpson?

232
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,589
Don't be nervous.
We believe in you, Homer.

233
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,136
Ladies and gentlemen,
esteemed councilmen,

234
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:33,769
boys and girls, retired people
with nothing better to do.

235
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,349
Danger comes in many,
many forms,

236
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,855
from dinosaurs that tormented
our caveman ancestors to the...

237
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,939
Simpson, get to the point.

238
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,614
I think we should put a stop sign at
"D" Street and 12th.

239
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,613
- The other...
- All in favor?

240
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,985
- Aye.
- Approved. Meeting adjourned.

241
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,913
Coffee and maple logs
in the lobby.

242
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,082
Wow. They listened to me.

243
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,711
- All right, Dad!
- Way to go, Homer.

244
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,289
You did it, Homer.

245
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,024
If they think I'm gonna
stop at that stop sign,

246
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,962
they're sadly mistaken.

247
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,533
Homer, I am so proud of you.

248
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,282
Proud? Proud of what?

249
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,284
Well, everything.
Your dip sign, for instance.

250
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,078
Now people won't be
caught off guard

251
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,831
by that little "-" in the road.

252
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,583
What a great family,
but come on.

253
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,996
We all know
this is small potatoes.

254
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,795
There's a danger in this town

255
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,418
that is bigger than
all the dips put together.

256
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:52,296
- What, Dad?
- I'm talking about that.

257
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,136
You don't mean you're going
to take on your old bosses.

258
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,062
- Wow.
- Gee, Dad's a hero.

259
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,352
- What'd ya say, son?
- Nothin'.

260
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,846
That's okay.

261
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,187
I'll just assume you said
what I thought I heard you say.

262
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,364
He also brought you
the speed bump...

263
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,487
The dip sign,

264
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:19,405
the 15 miles per hour speed limit
on Main Street.

265
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,416
I give you the man whose very name
is synonymous with safety.

266
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,710
Homer Simpson!

267
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:29,763
- Homer! Homer!
- Thank you.

268
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,680
Unlike most of you,
I am not a nut.

269
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,681
Just a good, honest American
who opposes wrongdoing...

270
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,975
and especially carelessness
wherever they occur.

271
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,861
Look at that man.

272
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,438
He has the crowd
in the palm of his hand.

273
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,065
Haven't seen anything
like it since Jolson.

274
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,823
Who is he?

275
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,155
That's Homer Simpson, sir.

276
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,200
He used to work here
in the plant,

277
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,044
but we fired him
for gross incompetence.

278
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,039
So that's his little game.

279
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,332
Get this Simpson
character up here right now.

280
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,876
But Mr. Burns...

281
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,959
I said do it! Now do it!
Do it! Do it!

282
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:15,547
Our lives are at the hands
of men no smarter than you or I,

283
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,426
many of them, incompetent boobs.

284
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,684
I know this because
I worked alongside them,

285
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,687
gone bowling with them,

286
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,819
watched them pass me over
for promotions time and again.

287
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:32,068
And I say, this stinks! -

288
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:36,282
Hey. Hey, Simpson,
Burns wants to talk to you privately.

289
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,275
- Privately?
- Yes.

290
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,367
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

291
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:52,046
Homer Simpson,
at last we meet. Same here.

292
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:57,181
Simpson, I want you to rejoin
our power plant family.

293
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,761
- Sorry. No can do.
- Hear me out, Simpson!

294
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:04,598
I don't want you to come back
as a technical supervisor

295
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,435
or supervising technician

296
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,480
or whatever the hell
you used to do.

297
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,734
I want you to be in charge
of safety here at the plant.

298
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,898
- Safety?
- But, sir, if truth be known,

299
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,868
I actually caused
more accidents around here

300
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,318
than any other employee.

301
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,158
There were even a few doozies
no one ever found out about.

302
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,124
The generous offer I'm making
is good for exactly...

303
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,785
30 seconds, Simpson.

304
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,125
Me, in charge of safety?

305
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,420
This place could blow sky high.

306
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,344
Nah. I'll concentrate
on my work now.

307
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,344
Gee, this guy's desk
sure is big.

308
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,006
I can't let Marge support
the family.

309
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,905
This guy's got the cleanest
shirt I've ever seen.

310
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,970
What should I...

311
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,926
Simpson, time's up.

312
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,347
What the hey.
I'll take the job.

313
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,476
Excellent.

314
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,862
Your first duty will be
to step out on the balcony

315
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,491
and tell that crowd
this plant is safe.

316
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,490
- What?
- Go on, Homer.

317
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,493
Homer! Homer!
Homer! Homer! Homer!

318
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,827
Yeah, Homer!

319
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,873
Go, Dad!

320
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:12,126
Ladies and gentlemen,
this plant is...

321
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,550
Sit tight.
I'll be right back.

322
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,481
I can't do it, Mr. Burns.

323
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,610
You mean, you're willing to give up
a good job and a raise

324
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,018
just for your principles?

325
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,737
When you put it that way,
it does sound a little farfetched,

326
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,739
but that's the lug
you're lookin' at!

327
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,371
And I vow to continue spending
every free minute I have...

328
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,990
crusading for safety!

329
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,908
Of course, I'd have a lot less
of those free minutes

330
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,537
if you gave me the job.

331
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,214
You're not as stupid
as you look or sound...

332
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,713
or our best testing indicates.

333
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,506
You've got the job.
Now get to work!

334
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,380
I'll get to work,

335
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:04,177
but first I have to say
good-bye to some friends.

336
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,564
Friends,

337
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,942
you have come to depend on me
as your safety watchdog

338
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,071
so you won't scrape yourself
or stub your toes

339
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,069
or blow yourselves up.

340
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,151
But you can't depend on me
all your life.

341
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:25,528
You have to learn that there's
a little Homer Simpson in all of us,

342
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,327
and I'm going to have to live
without your respect and awe.

343
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,631
The only reason
I'm telling you this is...

344
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,169
