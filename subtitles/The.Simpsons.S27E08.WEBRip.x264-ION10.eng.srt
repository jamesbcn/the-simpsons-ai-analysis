Bart,
if we find those inventions,

we can prove that Amelia
was scientifically significant.

-Pass.
-Listen to me.

88
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,017
I need to prove this woman
was not a lunatic

{\an8}Well, I'd say the best bet

99
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,541
{\an8}is the sewer pipe.

Behold... the diary of Nathan Little!

"I pushed a vagabond

148

What's a trolley?

00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,666
Old-timey subway.

-Homeless guy.

Where is that kid?
We got a recital next week

156
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,189

Ralphie, what is going on here?

161
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,571
Bart made us read pages
from a scary diary.

162
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,994
I was so a-scared, sour juice
came out my front tail.

163

Bart wrote this? This is bad.

164

Ooh, really bad.

165
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,580

That's bad, too.

173
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,851
Yeah, these are pages
from your son's diary.

174
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm afraid they very
clearly show him to be...

175
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,271
a sociopath.

176
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,191
Hmm. Well, I've never seen Bart
write in cursive,

177
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,231
so I'm a little proud of that,

178
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,074
but this is the worst thing

179
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,360
that's ever happened
to this family.

180
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,864
Oh, I'm sorry, Marge.

181
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,735
And... shuffle off,

182
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,412
shuffle off,

183
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,030
shuffle off.

184
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,205
(Homer humming cheerfully)

185
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,130
Homie, I've learned something
terrible about Bart.

186
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,458
You may want to have a drink.

187
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,463
Way ahead of ya.

188
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,715
Chief Wiggum found these pages
from our son's diary!

189
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,468
Oh, I've had a long day.

190
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,721
Bart might be a sociopath.

191
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,143
Socio-what?

192
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,311
{\an8}(groans) "Someone who
can't feel empathy or guilt.

193
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,641
{\an8}They do terrible things
and don't care who it hurts."

194
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,018
(doorbell chiming repeatedly)

195
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,404
Don't answer that!
It could be Bart!

196
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,402
-Bart has a key.
-What?! Who gave him a key?!

197
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,322
Hey, Mrs. Simpson.
Can Bart come over

198
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,914
and see my grandfather's collection

199
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,239
of Japanese swords
and throwing daggers?

200
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,075
Aah! Why don't you play
with Lisa instead, hmm?

201
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,002
(grunts)

202
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,329
<i>Konnichi-whaaa...?!</i>

203
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,495
Hey, Milhouse.

204
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,423
Wow, this is a surprise.

205
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,422
I'm usually sweating when we talk,
but not this time.

206
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,375
It's amazing how you can charm
and disgust me at the same time.

207
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,927
That's just what happens

208
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,180
when I'm with
the prettiest girl in town.

209
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,432
Aw...

210
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,934
(cackles, snorts)

211
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,015
Ew.

212
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,769
Amelia's journal tells us

213
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,771
that her invention
is buried in the basement

214
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,773
of the Springfield Suffragette Society.

215
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,765
Ah... anyone ever tell you

216
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,937
you're beautiful
when you're sleuthing?

217
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,276
Milhouse, did the Hardy Boys
ever hit on Nancy Drew?

218
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,953
Frank did, but Joe...

219
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,781
let's just say
there's a mystery about him.

220
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,037
The Suffragette Society
was right here.

221
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,787
Oh... here?

222
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,296
Hey, sweetie,
you looking for your mom?

223
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,049
I'll find her--
just, uh, give me her cup size.

224
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,631
Actually, we're here
because your basement

225
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,176
is home to a landmark
of feminist history.

226
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,721
Do you mind if we poke around?

227
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,934
The basement, eh?
Yeah, that's where we wash

228
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,314
the ketchup off the old onion rings.

229
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,812
-So no.
-These guys want a children's menu?

230
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,484
Nah, they're just leavin'.

231
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,823
Seriously, kids,
I got to switch ten TVs

232
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,488
over to the fourth round
of the NBA draft, so get lost.

233
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,359
All right, Denver Nuggets
on the clock, people!

234
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,993
Okay, I found a test online

235
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,485
that will tell us, once and for all,

236
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,407
whether Bart is a... you know.

237
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,495
HOMER:
Wait a minute!

238
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,580
We can't just give Bart something
labeled "Sociopath Test"!

239
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,496
He might look it up
and set us on fire with his mind!

240
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,166
You're right!
We need Bart to think

241
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,844
the test is for something else.

242
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,262
Finally!
A use for the label maker!

243
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,177
One of you betrayed me,
and snitches lose their stitches.

244
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,854
(high-pitched)
Sit on my banana!

245
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,432
(low voice)
Why, you little...!

246
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,017
(grunting)

247
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,942
Where does he get this stuff?

248
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,691
Hey, son, your mom and I
just found this quiz

249
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,443
you'd really love to take.

250
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,025
"Are You a Jet Ski Dude

251
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,950
or a Motocross Maestro?"

252
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,109
Remember to answer
the questions honestly.

253
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,367
We want to know if you meet
the clinical definition

254
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,620
of "Jet Ski dude."

255
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,415
"I enjoy manipulating
other people."

256
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,379
"I believe I'm being followed."

257
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,840
"Sometimes I feel as if I must
injure myself or someone else."

258
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,881
Agree, agree, agree.

259
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,375
Hmm.

260
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,547
"Sociopath."

261
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,675
What's that?

262
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,062
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

263
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,060
That's what they think I am?

264
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,562
Fine! I'll pretend to be
the biggest sociopath in the world!

265
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,186
And I only need to change
three answers.

266
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,863
-Is he nuts?
-I don't know.

267
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,111
-What do you think?
-I mean, he looks nuts,

268
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,904
-that's for sure.
-(clears throat)

269
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,567
So, here's your test.

270
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,736
Call me crazy, but I enjoyed it.

271
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,744
(Bart whistling
"Pop Goes the Weasel")

272
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,076
Hmm.

273
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,582
Well, the good news
is that Bart just got

274
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,325
his first 100% ever on a test.

275
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,417
Oh, my God.
What do we do?

276
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,923
Whatever Bart wants.

277
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,554

278
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,471

00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,899
(male voice, Scottish accent)
My pleasure.

294
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,941
Anything to take down Knockers.

295
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,154
I've always hated them,
because they wouldn't open up

296
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,985
at 4:00 a.m. to show
the World Caber Tossing Championships.

297
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,492
Okay, Willie,
you can only use the jackhammer

298
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,535
when there's lots of noise upstairs.

299
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,998
No worries.

300
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,828
It is Monday Night Football,

301
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,083
by which I mean American football,

302
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,376
by which I mean no football at all!

303
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,500
-(muffled cheering and applause)
-(jackhammering)

304
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,297
(gasps)
There's the box!

305
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,470
(muffled cheering and applause)

306
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,641
Ow! Medium spicy!

307
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,219
Ach!
We've hit the hot sauce supply line!

308
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,635
I'll have to neutralize it
with some signature blue cheese!

309
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,145
Ah...!

310
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,436
Look at me! I'm a sociopath!

311
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,534
Marge, it's time we did something.

312
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,200
We can take him swimming.
That makes him sleepy.

313
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,699
Not good enough.
We have to call the number

314
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,582
at the bottom of the test.

315
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,198
What number?

316
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,865
-Right there.
-"New Beginnings"?

317
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,173
We're gonna trust our son
to an 800 number?

318
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,878
It's 888.

319
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,088
Marge, this is for his own good.

320
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,089
He failed an online test.

321
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,471
How much more proof do you need?

322
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,378
Cue-abunga!

323
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,047
-(Flanders screams)
-(Bart laughs)

324
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,807
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

325
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,809
Whoa, cool! But wait a minute,

326
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,811
my birthday's not
for another two months.

327
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,653
We know!
But we wanted to have your party now!

328
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,069
They were having a sale on piñatas and...

329
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,279
one thing led to another
so we, you know,

330
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,161
had a thing, mumble, mumble, mumble...
mumble...

331
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,409
Well, where are my friends?

332
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,660
Well, I was gonna mail out invites,

333
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,082
but I was out of stamps
and the post office line was long,

334
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,712
(mumbling) and I didn't know
where all the little...

335
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,330
Well, more cake for me.

336
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,746
No, no, no, no.
Do the Moon Bounce first.

337
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,586
Yes! The Moon Bounce!

338
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,721
Don't want you throwing up
this delicious cake.

339
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,839
(clunking)

340
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,597
(grunting, laughing)

341
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,643
(laughing)

342
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,846
Huh?

343
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,846
Eh.

344
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,647
(laughing)

345
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,111
-(engine revs, tires squeal)
-BART: Whoa!

346
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,902
(Bart laughing)

347
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,118
Wait a minute.
What is this?

348
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,293
Is it an asylum?

349
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,871
No, it's a pizza parlor.

350
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,286
Please tell me, Dad,
is it really a pizza parlor?

351
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,295
No, son-- the pizza parlor
is where your mom and I

352
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,128
are going afterwards.
Now, you're gonna be fine.

353
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,474
I wouldn't be surprised if you
were the least messed-up kid

354
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,470
in the whole joint.
We love you!

355
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,144
Wait, wait, wait!
I didn't even get to say good-bye.

356
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,563
Good-bye!

357
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,481
I'll never forgive you!

358
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,310
There. You happy?

359
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,243
Let me out!
I was just playing a joke!

360
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,489
A cruel joke on people that love me!
That I don't regret!

361
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,282
That doesn't make me a sociopath!

362
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,985
-(door creaks open)
-WOMAN: Children,

363
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,405
form a line in order of medication
from Adderall to Zoloft.

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,170
You have been brought here
for a purpose.

365
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,672
You are fearless,
and no one can stop you.

366
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,505
Which means you'll be of great use...

367
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,680
To the U.S. military.

368
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,683
I expected more of a reaction.

369
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,182
I waited outside
the door and everything.

370
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,524
They don't react.
That's what we want.

371
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,190
Right.

372
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,768
We'll be using you
in the ultimate video game

373
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,274
to test these U.S. Air Force
drone simulators.

374
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,029
Man, that is a tough crowd.

375
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,450
{\an8}HOMER: Oh!

376
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,700
Mom, Dad, I've discovered
the most amazing thing!

377
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,123
I can't wait...
Um, where's Bart?

378
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,872
-He's safe.
-And more importantly, we're safe.

379
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,285
(sobs)

380
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,753
I miss him so much.

381
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,883
(panting)

382
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,881
Oh. Can I call him?

383
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,053
You can call his guard, Tico.

384
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,221
He picks up sometimes.

385
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,549
I see.

386
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,474
Okay, I'll do that.

387
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,722
Homie, where did we go wrong?

388
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,715
I don't know, sweetie.
I don't know.

389
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,977
We did everything we could
for him during the commercials.

390
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,231
And we're live
as Lisa Simpson prepares to prove

391
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,904
that Springfield embarrassment
Amelia Vanderbuckle

392
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,034
deserves to be in the female
scientific pantheon,

393
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,072
along with Marie Curie and, uh,

394
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,065
you know, uh, um,

395
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,577
Velma from <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

396
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,410
Thank you all for coming out

397
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,325
to support a woman's place
in history!

398
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,666
That's what this is?

399
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,790
I thought it was
a Green Bay Packers rally.

400
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,747
All right, you know what,
this ain't coming off.

401
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,048
Behold, the masterpiece
of Amelia Vanderbuckle.

402
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:51,844
(crowd murmurs)

403
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,177
A loom?!

404
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,392
That isn't science.

405
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,931
That's home economics.

406
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,845
Everyone, storm the stage!

407
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,853
-(crowd clamoring)
-Not so fast!

408
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,515
This is no ordinary loom!

409
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,443
Even an extraordinary loom

410
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,862
is the most boring thing
I could think of.

411
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:09,611
This is much, much more
than just a loom.

412
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,025
(clacking)

413
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,533
(squeaking, clicking)

414
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,275
(whirring, clanking)

415
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
(puffing)

416
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,499
(crowd gasping in wonder)

417
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,666
-It's alive!
-And polite!

418
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:33,005
"Operand"? Looks like it wants us
to give it a math problem.

419
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,175
(grunting)

420
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,267
(whirring, thudding)

421
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,851
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

422
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,147
It's the first computational device!

423
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,901
People, people, don't you see?

424
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,743
The board acts like punch cards

425
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,488
and the loom like a computer,

426
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,910
with the Charles Babbage
and the John von Neumann...

427
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,330
Let's have-- the square root of nine--
cheers for Lisa!

428
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,325
(whirring, clanking)

429
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,083
ALL: Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

430
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,921
You see that, Bart?
You see what your sister did?

431
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,014
<i>Yeah, yeah, great.</i>

432
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,009
<i>Listen, I'm in a simulator,</i>

433
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,381
<i>so I can't really talk.</i>

434
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,337
<i>And you know I'm a sociopath,</i>

435
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,007
<i>so I'm just going through</i>
<i>the motions here.</i>

436
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,176
<i>I love you.</i>

437
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,603
<i>I was just saying that to myself.</i>

438
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,351
(beep)

439
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,023
Kaboom! Blam-blam-blam!

440
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,063
Have a smart bomb, stupid.

441
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,185
(imitates explosions)

442
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,861

00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,025
You are impressive.

446
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,204
Even though I'm the only
real person in the world,

447
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,542
and, therefore, I created you
in my imagination.

448
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,368
Children, your empty souls
and flying fingers

449
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,214
are very impressive,
and I can tell you now

450
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,710
that was no simulation.

451
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,463
You mean we were
blowing up real stuff?

452
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,376
That's right--
convoys, terrorist training camps,

453
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,135
suspicious weddings,
Kabul Starbucks.

454
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,798
-Cool!
-I knew it!

455
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,216
(voice breaking)
No, I thought it was a video game.

456
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,425
I don't want to hurt real people.

457
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,226
Oh, I want to go home.

458
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,729
Please?

459
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,231
How disappointing.

460
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,322
Does anyone else
share the human boy's feelings?

461
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,399
Son, the truth is,
the simulators we told you

462
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,655
weren't simulators were simulators.

463
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,568

464
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,906
Now, I'm sorry, Bart,

465
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,241
but you are a healthy,
normal boy.

466
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,826
We're sending you home.

467
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,711
Really? Oh, wow.
Dudes, it's been real.

468
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,419
Although, actually,
it was all a fake.

469
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,589
I'll never forget you,
Bart Simpson.

470
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,628
742 Evergreen Terrace.

471
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,762
Dog door in the back

473
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,259
My little guy is back!

474
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,684
And I'm not bad!
I just made bad decisions.

475
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,604
(crying)
It's okay, boy.

476
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,603
You started out life
as a bad decision.

477
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,766
The best bad decision
I ever made.

478
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,106
(all crying)

479
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,112
(crying)
And I restored the reputation

480
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,855
of a scientist from 100 years ago.

481
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,333
(crying) And Maggie tried
strawberries for the first time.

482
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:09,002

What a day!
