1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,463
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,826
And now, to top off

3
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,704
our most propane explosion-free
science week ever,

4
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:41,291
our grand finale: The launching
of a weather balloon.

5
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,962
Go, weather balloon!
Hurrah for science! Whoo!

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,339
Hurrah for science? Whoo?

7
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,258
Well, I can't say
I approve of the whoo,

8
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,677
but the hurrah
was quite heartening.

9
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,761
Release the balloon.

10
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,698
No!

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,953
I don't think
I really captured the eyes.

12
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,872
Bart, if you have a failing,

13
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,999
it's that you're
always demanding perfection.

14
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,876
If you have a failing.

15
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,252
Whoever brings down
that balloon

16
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,796
doesn't have
to learn fractions!

17
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,928
Eh, careful, children.
That's my car.

18
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,809
Destroy that balloon.

19
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:41,892
Aye.

20
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,064
Tango 14,
we're being fired at.

21
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,274
I'm getting an exact I.D.
on the bogey now.

22
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,319
Iraqis again.

23
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,738
Launching sidewinder missile.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,451
Missed him.

25
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,703
Launching second
sidewinder missile.

26
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,085
This is what happens

27
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,521
when you cut money
out of the military

28
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,462
and put it
into health care!

29
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,964
It's a good program!

30
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,174
Just give it a chance.
That's all I ask!

31
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,891
Hmm, it won't
come down for months.

32
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,309
Curse the man
who invented helium.

33
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,688
Curse Pierre-Jules-Cesar
Janssen.

34
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,857
Now to find out who did this.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,817
Bart, empty your pockets.

36
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,527
Empty my pockets, you say?

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,654
Well, certainly, but I fail

38
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,573
to see how...

39
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,616
Blueprints of the dummy,

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,994
notarized photos
of you making the dummy,

41
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,747
and an alternate wording
for the banner... Buttzilla.

42
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,583
Race you to Utah,
Milhouse.

43
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,666
Okay.

44
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,129
I am going to punish you
for this, Bart.

45
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,590
And it won't just be
a simple caning this time.

46
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,050
Because you have impeded
science,

47
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,803
you must now aid science.

48
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,015
Yes. Starting tomorrow,
you will assist me

49
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,684
with my amateur astronomy,
taking down coordinates,

50
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,311
carrying equipment,
and so forth.

51
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,770
4:30 in the morning.

52
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,355
There's a 4:30
in the morning now?

53
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,736
Top of the hour,
time for the morning news.

54
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,863
But of course,
there is no news yet.

55
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,824
Everyone's still asleep
in their comfy, comfy beds.

56
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,075
Good night, everybody.

57
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,750
Mom, will you
make me breakfast?

58
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,837
There's a stuffed pepper in
the trash from last night.

59
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,756
Just rinse it good.

60
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,840
Come home, Lassie!

61
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,841
Here, boy!

62
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,925
Come on, girl!

63
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,721
Attaboy!

64
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,316
It's still dark.

65
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,484
Better use the generator.

66
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,584
Ah, there's nothing
more exciting than science.

67
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,544
You get all the fun
of sitting still,

68
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,713
being quiet,
writing down numbers,

69
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,090
paying attention.

70
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,967
Science has it all.

71
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,945
Is that the telescope we're
gonna be looking through?

72
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,887
Yes, but you won't
be looking through it.

73
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,722
I forbid it.

74
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,642
But you don't need a telescope
to enjoy astronomy, Bart.

75
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,353
There are all the constellations
you've heard so much about.

76
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,148
There's Orion, the Swan,
the Chariot Race.

77
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,001
Why don't they look anything
like their names?

78
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,027
Well, you do have
to use your imagination.

79
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,989
Look, there's
the three wise men.

80
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,573
Who names these things,
anyway?

81
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,075
Whoever discovers them.

82
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,678
I've been hoping
I could find something

83
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,036
that would be named
after me.

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,122
And you've never
found anything?

85
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,833
Once, but by the time
I got to a phone

86
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,418
my discovery
had already been reported

87
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,546
by Principal Kahoutek.

88
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,673
I got back at him, though.

89
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,009
Him and that little boy of his.

90
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,385
Anyway, that's why
I always keep

91
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,137
a cellular phone next to me.

92
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,930
Now, this morning,
we're gonna be mapping

93
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,783
a small square of sky
that's thought to be empty.

94
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,267
It's my hope that it's not.

95
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,644
So, what am I supposed
to do exactly?

96
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,147
Just write down my findings
as I give them to you.

97
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,441
Six hours,
19 minutes right ascension

98
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,986
14 degrees,
22 minutes declination...

99
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,238
No sighting.

100
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,490
Six hours, 19 minutes,
right ascension,

101
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,494
14 degrees,
23 minutes declination...

102
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,579
No sighting.

103
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,249
Six hours, 19 minutes
right ascension,

104
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,210
14 degrees,
58 minutes declination...

105
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,964
No sighting.
Did you get that one, Bart?

106
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,175
- Hell, no.
- Good.

107
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,052
My stars!
Give me the phone quick!

108
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,184
Check out 6-19-14-59.

109
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,817
No. No, there's no need
for that.

110
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,528
It's already named after me.

111
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,238
It's getting pretty close
to the ground.

112
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,865
Maybe I can catch it.

113
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,533
Don't touch
the telescope, Bart.

114
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,327
Even a slight change
in elevation

115
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,995
can destroy
a whole morning's work.

116
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,212
Whoo! All hands on deck!

117
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,172
Pirates off the port bow!

118
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,255
Hey.

119
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,891
Observatory?
This is Bart Simpson.

120
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,852
I see something in the sky
at 4-12-8

121
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,646
and the last number is seven.

122
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,029
Ah, got you,
my rumpy doppelganger.

123
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,242
I've got it. Hey...

124
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,160
What are you doing?
Give me that phone.

125
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,121
Congratulations, Bart.

126
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,872
You've just
discovered a comet.

127
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,834
No!

128
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,088
No!

129
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,261
No!

130
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,727
And then I sped away

131
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,021
without anyone seeing
my license plate.

132
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,745
Sounds like you had
a good day today, Dad.

133
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,776
Yeah, except I forgot
to go to work.

134
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,320
What did you do today, Bart?

135
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,865
What didn't I do?

136
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,825
"Boy discovers comet."

137
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,909
What?

138
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,202
"A young Springfieldianite

139
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,620
"has discovered a new comet

140
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,247
to be known as
the Bart Simpson comet."

141
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,250
Oh, honey,
I'm so proud of you.

142
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,128
But then, you've always
been proud of me.

143
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,213
Yes.

144
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,637
Won't you join us, Bart?

145
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,894
I guess so.

146
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,479
As the first student

147
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,231
at Springfield Elementary
to discover a comet,

148
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,941
we're very proud
to make you a member

149
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,320
of our very select group.

150
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,448
Welcome to Super Friends.

151
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,075
Welcome, super friend.

152
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,829
I am called Ham,
since I enjoy ham radio.

153
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,289
This is E-mail,

154
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,665
Cosine,

155
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,042
Report Card,

156
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,293
Database,

157
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,628
and Lisa.

158
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,464
Your nickname
will be Cosmos.

159
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,235
Well, I'm done eating.
Good-bye.

160
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,636
Good-bye, Cosmos.

161
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,221
Bye-bye.

162
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,640
Perhaps some night you
could show us your comet.

163
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,183
There it is right there.

164
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,935
I make it a point
never to turn my head

165
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,187
unless I expect
to see something, Bart.

166
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,606
Naturally, we can't see
your comet in broad daylight,

167
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,900
and without a telescope.

168
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,818
But you don't need
a stupid telescope.

169
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,487
It's right there.

170
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,948
Oh, no, no, no.

171
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,741
This isn't right at all.

172
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,411
It must be coming toward us
at a fantastic speed.

173
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,122
Don't you realize what's happening, Bart?

174
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,850
Your comet is gonna
collide with the earth,

175
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,644
and every living thing
in its path will be killed.

176
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,978
I knew you'd try
to find something wrong

177
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,504
with my comet, Lisa.

178
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,548
You've always been
petty and small,

179
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,757
right from the beginning.

180
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,926
We must alert
the proper authorities.

181
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,262
To the observatory!

182
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,643
We are the Super Friends!

183
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,311
Hey, shut up.

184
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,693
Dear God!

185
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,611
Warren, we've
talked about you

186
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,196
hogging the eyepiece.

187
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,704
Sounds like
the doomsday whistle.

188
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,499
Ain't been blown
for nigh on to three years.

189
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,544
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Trouble a-brewing.

190
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,546
Fellow citizens,

191
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,590
when I learned
about the impending crisis,

192
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,385
I caught the very next plane
to Springfeld... Field.

193
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,890
First of all, yes,
there is a comet in the sky,

194
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,268
and, yes, it is going
to hit Springfield.

195
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,314
You, uh, don't need
to applaud that.

196
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,108
Now, here's what we think
the impact might look like.

197
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,359
Show them, Jerry.

198
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,826
Oh, dear God, no!

199
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,164
Fortunately,
we have a plan.

200
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,958
- Professor Frink.
- Good evening, ladies and...

201
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,586
Quit stalling!
What's the plan?

202
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,713
All right, just take your seat.
Just take your seat.

203
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,966
Now, working with former
Carter administration officials

204
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,153
and military men who were
forced into early retirement

205
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,222
for various reasons which we
won't go into here,

206
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,099
we have planned
this defense for the city.

207
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,061
As the comet hurtles
toward the city

208
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,649
our rocket will intercept it
and blow it to smithereens. Hey!

209
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,193
Oh, dear God, no!

210
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,987
And that will be the end
of our Mr. Comet.

211
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,031
Yay! We're saved!

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,378
Will you all stop worrying
about that stupid comet?

213
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,254
It's going to be destroyed.

214
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,024
Didn't you hear what the guy
in the building said?

215
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,550
- But Dad, don't you think...
- Ah, Lisa.

216
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,636
The whole reason we
have elected officials

217
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,138
is so we don't have
to think all the time.

218
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,642
Just like that rain forest
scare a few years back.

219
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,435
Our officials saw
there was a problem

220
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,020
and they fixed it,
didn't they?

221
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,230
No, Dad,
I don't think...

222
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,940
There's that word again.

223
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,840
Homer, what if this
doesn't work?

224
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,550
Well, then,
I have a backup plan.

225
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,009
See, while the unprepared

226
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,887
are still sitting around
twiddling their thumbs

227
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:02,971
and going...

228
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,647
Dad, the plan!

229
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,940
I'm getting to that.

230
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,191
So, anyway, they're going...

231
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,409
- Dad!
- So, anyway, we get in our car

232
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,994
and take the bridge
out of town,

233
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,121
while all the while,
they're still going...

234
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,836
Dad, they're firing
the rocket!

235
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,840
All right!

236
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,773
It blew up the bridge!

237
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,982
We're doomed!

238
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,525
It's times like this

239
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,611
I wish I were
a religious man.

240
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,946
It's all over, people!

241
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,823
We don't have a prayer!

242
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,546
And like Icarus,

243
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,715
the rocket foolishly soared

244
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,551
too high and lost control of
its servo-guidance mechanism

245
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,430
leaving us with some...
six hours to live.

246
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,766
So, let's go live now

247
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,852
to the charred remains
of the only bridge out of town

248
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,104
with Arnie Pie
and Arnie in the Sky.

249
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,732
With the bridge gone
and the airport

250
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,460
unfortunately on the other
side of the bridge,

251
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,152
a number of citizens
are attempting

252
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,946
to jump the gorge
with their cars.

253
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,657
It's a silent testament
to the "Never give up

254
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,118
and never think things out"
spirit of our citizens.

255
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,870
With our utter
annihilation imminent,

256
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,765
our federal government
has snapped into action.

257
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,541
We go live now,
via satellite,

258
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,459
to the floor of the
United States congress.

259
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:01,882
Then it is unanimous, we are
going to approve the bill

260
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,093
to evacuate the town
of Springfield

261
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,554
in the great state of...

262
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,889
Wait a second, I want to tack on
a rider to that bill.

263
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,309
$30 million of taxpayer money
to support the perverted arts.

264
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,605
All in favor of the amended
Springfield/pervert bill?

265
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,192
Bill defeated.

266
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,319
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again:

267
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,114
Democracy simply doesn't work.

268
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,574
Now, over the years,

269
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,284
a newsman learns
a number of things

270
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,829
that for one reason or another,
he just cannot report.

271
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,080
It doesn't seem
to matter now,

272
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,749
so the following people
are gay:

273
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,419
Turn it off.

274
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,837
Just a second.

275
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,218
What's everyone
so worked up about?

276
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,679
So there's a comet.
Big deal.

277
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,015
It'll burn up in our atmosphere,
and what's ever left

278
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,892
will be no bigger
than a Chihuahua's head.

279
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,852
Wow, Dad, maybe you're right.

280
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,437
Of course I'm right.

281
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,771
If I'm not, may we all be

282
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,565
horribly crushed
from above somehow.

283
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,111
Okay, if you're
that worried about it,

284
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,655
let's go down
to the bomb shelter.

285
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,240
We have a bomb shelter?

286
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,993
Homer Simpson takes
care of his family.

287
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,497
Flanders, open up!

288
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,499
Hi-dee-ho-a-rooney,
neighbor.

289
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,501
- What can I do you for?
- Get out of there.

290
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,379
- My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
- Homer!

291
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,298
Oh, I kind of figured
this might happen,

292
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,884
so I built the shelter
big enough for both our families.

293
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,885
No deal. Out.

294
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,178
Get in the shelter, Homer.

295
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,914
One more hour.

296
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,248
An hour?

297
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,167
I can't wait another hour.

298
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,710
What's keeping
that stupid comet?

299
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,004
There it is.

300
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,427
Well, howdely-doodely, neighbors.

301
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,097
Shouldn't you be in
your shelterinis by now?

302
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,140
We haven't got shelterinis.

303
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,558
We want in yours.

304
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,227
Oh, well, sorry.

305
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,520
The shelter's kind of full.

306
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,563
Really? Oh.

307
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,416
Well, we'll just go off
someplace and die then.

308
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,525
Thanks.

309
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,946
Wait!

310
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,799
You know, I may regret this
when our air runs out

311
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,283
and we can't whistle
or stay alive, but...

312
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,702
Oh, what the hey.

313
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,917
I can't... get the...

314
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,962
I can't get the door closed.

315
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,880
Somebody's going
to have to get out.

316
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,550
I'd get out,
but I don't know where I am.

317
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,094
Hey, somebody's touching me.

318
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,013
- I am.
- Oh, okay.

319
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,724
Okay, okay, let's figure out
who should stay.

320
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,769
Let's see. The world
of the future will need laughter,

321
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,229
so I'm in.

322
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,356
And they'll need somebody
to dispense drinks...

323
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,774
I.E., me.

324
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,485
And someone will have
to run the power.

325
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,569
You can do that, Homer.

326
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,572
Uh... Yeah.

327
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,240
I can do that.

328
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,328
Okay, let's start again.

329
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,914
We'll need laughter,
religious enlightenment,

330
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,208
gossip...
That's Mrs. Lovejoy.

331
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,211
Wait a minute, we all know the one thing
we won't need in the future...

332
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,047
Left-handed stores.

333
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,465
That's you, Flanders.

334
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,634
I'm terribly sorry.

335
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,262
Flanders is the only
useless person here.

336
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,806
If anyone dies,
it should be him.

337
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,183
I'm sorry.

338
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,851
Please forgive me.

339
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,394
So let's kick Flanders out.

340
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,478
Sorry.

341
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,274
Well, sir, sounds fair.

342
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,692
Toodle-oo, everybody.

343
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,319
I'll scream when
the comet gets here.

344
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,820
Oh, I'm coming
with you, Neddy.

345
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,072
No, sweetheart.

346
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,241
You... You stay
here because...

347
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,285
Okay.

348
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,745
I might go mad with fear
out there,

349
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,790
so, Todd, I want you
to shoot Daddy

350
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,417
if he tries to get back in.

351
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,252
Okay, Dad.

352
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,253
Okay.

353
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:12,633
Que sera, sera.

354
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:18,639
Whatever will be, will be.

355
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:23,185
The future's
not ours to see...

356
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,689
Hey, I got an idea.

357
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,109
We can play a game
to pass the time.

358
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,653
I'll make the sound
of a barnyard animal,

359
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,197
and you all try
to guess what it is.

360
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,454
- It's a pig.
- It's a cow, man.

361
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,414
- It's a pony.
- No, it's a goat.

362
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,125
You know,
one of them lady goats.

363
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,919
There are no lady goats.
A lady goat is a sheep.

364
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,088
- I believe she's right.
- You're crazy.

365
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,090
- Arr! What's it to you?
- What's it to me?

366
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,468
It's a pony.

367
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,138
Stop it! Stop it!

368
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,682
Can't you see this
barnyard noise guessing game

369
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,809
is tearing us apart?

370
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,104
Que sera, sera.

371
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,816
Whatever will be,
will be...

372
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,777
Say, Moe, was it a duck?

373
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,868
No, no! Shut up! Shut up!

374
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,828
Stop it, stop it!

375
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,663
I can't take this anymore.

376
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,000
I can't let that brave man
out there die alone.

377
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,003
I'm surprised and disgusted
by all of you.

378
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,380
Especially his children.

379
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,798
I'm going out there.

380
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,093
And it was a baby ox.

381
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,386
He's right, you know.

382
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,387
About the ox?

383
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,972
About everything, damn it!

384
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,055
Hey, Homer, wait up.

385
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,434
I want to die too.

386
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,436
- If you are going, I am going.
- Me too.

387
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,688
I'm outta here. Make way.

388
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,317
Radio reception
in there sucked.

389
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,572
When I was just
a little girl

390
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,491
I asked my mother.

391
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,995
What will I be?

392
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:10,626
Will I be pretty,
will I be rich?

393
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:15,547
Here's what she said to me.

394
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:19,968
Que sera, sera.

395
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,638
Whatever will be.

396
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,307
Will be.

397
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,437
The future's not ours
to see.

398
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,397
Que sera...

399
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,815
Run!

400
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,491
- Look!
- It's breaking up!

401
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,589
Cool.

402
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,924
We're saved.

403
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,761
Sure makes you appreciate

404
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,680
the preciousness of life.

405
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,475
Let's go burn down
the observatory

406
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,185
so this'll
never happen again.

407
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,399
I can't believe that extra-thick
layer of pollution

408
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,025
that I've actually
picketed against

409
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,986
is what burned up
the comet.

410
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,821
What's really amazing

411
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,574
is that this is exactly
what Dad said would happen.

412
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,785
Yeah. Dad was right.

413
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,161
I know, kids.

414
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,871
I'm scared too.
