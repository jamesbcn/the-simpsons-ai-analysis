1
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,566
D'oh!

2
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,655
Ohhh!

3
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,117
Three, two, one... Happy New Year!
- Of school!

4
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,994
What are you doing?
- It's the first day of school!

5
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:13,327
You're the government's problem now!
- BOTH: Yeah!

6
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,928
Free at last, free at last!

7
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,839
I can't believe we have to start
another year of school.

8
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,841
I never learned anything
at that suck shack.

9
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,044
Who taught you that language?
- A kid at school.

10
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,779
So you did learn something.

11
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,417
Homie, the insurance bill is due today.
Can you make sure to mail it?

12
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,553
Absolutely.
Insurance is the greatest deal ever.

13
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,903
If I get hurt, I get paid.
And, man, do I get hurt!

14
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,069
Easy.

15
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,023
Oh!

16
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,123
What is it?

17
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,992
Not again!

18
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,228
ALL: D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

19
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,608
What a week.

20
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,648
Welcome to another school year.

21
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,085
One important note. The flower-based
names of the reading groups...

22
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,254
...are now barnyard-based.

23
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,859
Mr. Becker has protested the move.
So his group will remain the Daffodils.

24
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,291
Yeah! Where are my Dils at?

25
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,795
ALL: Go, Dils.
Go, Dils. Go, Dils.

26
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,001
I never tire of that.
One other announcement.

27
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,203
At the end of the month,
we'll be participating...

28
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,141
...in the Vice President's
Assessment Test.

29
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,241
He stinks!

30
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,444
We're assessing you, not him.
- Withdrawn.

31
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,481
The VPAT is part of the federal
government's No Child Left Alone Act.

32
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,383
It will be a rewarding day
of pencil sharpening...

33
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,485
...and eyes on your own paper keeping.

34
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,821
Cut the horse bull, Seymour.

35
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,924
Your scores on this test
will determine how much money...

36
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,593
...this suck shack gets for years to come.

37
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,396
So we will spend every moment
of the next two weeks...

38
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:28,501
...drilling the questions and answers
into your soft little skulls.

39
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,332
BOYS: Shy is to gregarious

40
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:37,102
GIRLS: As peaceful is to bellicose

41
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,251
Okay, children.
The answers to the standardized test...

42
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,986
...fall into 12 basic patterns.

43
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,824
Repeat after me:
Accaca, dabacca, accacaca.

44
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,260
Accaca, dabacca, accacaca.
- ALL: Accaca, dabacca, accacaca.

45
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,263
Number two: Dacacca, adada, badacad.

46
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:01,613
Dacacca, adada, badacad.
- Dacacca, adada, badacad.

47
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,603
Biggest city in Montana!

48
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,703
Helena?
- Wrong!

49
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,975
912 divided by six.
- You can't teach this way!

50
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,965
Yes, I can! Studies show it works.

51
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:16,149
Where were these studies conducted?
- Ball State!

52
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,284
So when you take your practice test,

53
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,020
take your number two pencil and...

54
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,655
What kind of pencil do we take again?

55
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,124
Number two. Take a number two.

56
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,671
Looks like you took a big number two.

57
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,700
Yes, quite so. As you can see,
I'm holding a big number two in my hands.

58
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,775
Enjoying the weight and feel of it.

59
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:52,051
Test day at last!
Now I can show off at the federal level!

60
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,020
Hey, Bart, on the practice test yesterday,

61
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,757
what did you pick as the best title
for the paragraph about Manifest Destiny?

62
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,325
Slurp my snot.

63
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,763
I wrote 'Slurp my snot' in the ovals
on the answer sheet. True story.

64
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,633
Dad! Bart's throwing away his future!

65
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,169
Oh, no! Now who will sell oranges
on the off ramp?

66
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,668
Great jokes make me hungry.

67
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,325
I wonder what's in the pantry?

68
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,488
HOMER: Wait a minute.

69
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,588
Mmm-hmm.

70
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,691
Wait a minute!

71
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,471
Bart, we need to talk to you about
your practice test.

72
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,697
I warned you.

73
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,848
You got a perfect score.

74
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,648
Wonderful job, son. Just stellar.

75
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,417
How did I do?
- 96.

76
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,719
What did I get wrong?
- Several answers.

77
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,456
Several? That's more than a few
and almost a bunch!

78
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,225
Bart, because of your
superior intellect...

79
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,761
No, but wait! I aced the math part, right?
Because I...

80
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,330
Run along now.

81
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,101
Bart, you and the other
perfect-scoring superstars...

82
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,304
...are exempt from taking
the actual test today.

83
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,074
No test?
- Don't be too disappointed.

84
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,143
We are throwing you
a pizza party at a bowling alley.

85
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,314
Well, it's about time.
- Come. Your helicopter awaits.

86
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,292
Check it out! Bart's a superstar, too!

87
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,027
Bart's here!
- Awesome!

88
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,297
Wait a minute. This
ain't no genius copter.

89
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,397
This is Con Air!

90
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,999
Take it away, Willie!

91
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,604
WILLIE: Enjoy your flight!

92
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:55,274
Brilliant plan to remove
all the underperformers for test day, sir.

93
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,706
Yes. All of them.

94
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,714
Why, Seymour,
it seems I left my sunglasses on the bus.

95
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:06,234
Well, I'd best retrieve them.
- Yes, yes, you'd best.

96
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,651
Sir?
- So long, superstars.

97
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,639
I can't believe it.
Superintendent Chalmers betrayed me...

98
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,376
...after all the wrapping paper
I bought from his daughter.

99
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:35,709
Pizza party! Pizza party!
- Helicopter! Helicopter!

100
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,751
Stop it! All of you!
- What's the matter, superstar?

101
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,586
Feeling sorry for the normals?

102
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,258
Don't you get it? There is no pizza party!
This isn't a helicopter!

103
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,385
No pizza party?
- Not a helicopter? Huh?

104
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,571
Let me explain this to you in terms
even the simplest will understand.

105
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,375
We're hiding you in Capital City
for the day so your numbskullery...

106
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,978
...won't drag down the test scores
of the children who are our future.

107
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,448
Told you.
- Will there be other numbskulls there?

108
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,518
Sort of a numbskull Olympics as it were?
- Let's all act stupid!

109
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,623
Guys, guys! Save it for the competition!

110
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,723
Mmm.

111
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:25,496
ID, please?
- Must be in the glove box.

112
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,670
Huh?

113
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,339
This was due two weeks ago.
I'm not insured!

114
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,766
For the first time in my life, I'm...

115
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,578
...financially responsible
for my own actions!

116
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,568
Uninsured! Uninsured!
- MAN: Idiot!

117
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,586
I'm not in good hands! I'm in no hands!
Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!

118
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,851
'Dear stupid insurance company,

119
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,418
'I meant to mail this on time.

120
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,990
'What do you mean, 'too bad'?

121
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,996
'Screw you! Heh heh.'

122
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,444
I won't be insured until 3:00!

123
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,080
Okay, until then,
I have to avoid any serious injuries...

124
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,849
...or accidents on my
property, or I'm ruined!

125
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,451
D'oh!

126
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,551
No, you don't!

127
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:29,128
Now I know some of you
may suffer from test anxiety.

128
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:33,666
Here's a helpful hint.
Imagine each question is a baby chick.

129
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,929
If you answer wrong, the chick dies.

130
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,306
Shut up. They would've died anyway.

131
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:44,210
Now the test will begin
in five, four, three...

132
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,646
Oh, my God.
We should've begun four minutes ago.

133
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,510
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

134
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:53,886
LISA: You can do it, Lisa. There's nothing
in the room but you and the test.

135
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,507
Focus.

136
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,820
Pride is to downfall
as overconfidence is to...

137
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,905
What? They're all equally valid.

138
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,825
But that can't be.
In life, everything only has one answer!

139
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,226
Piece of cake, huh?

140
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,697
Oh!

141
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,890
I'm writing on my shirt!

142
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,973
Hey, Seymour. I just realized something.

143
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:51,544
You're stuck babysitting us losers,
which makes you the real loser.

144
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,881
For your information, I am not a loser.
I am a successful principal...

145
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,650
...who paints houses in the summertime.

146
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,786
You painted our garage,
and it was peeling by October.

147
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,889
Your dad insisted I
use an inferior primer.

148
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,116
ALL: Loser, loser.

149
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,260
Excuse me, Mommy. I have to go potty.

150
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,524
Otto, can you pull over? Pull over!

151
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,468
Sorry. I was mesmerized
by the little boy's dance.

152
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,642
Yo, I'll tell you what I want
What I really, really want

153
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,744
So tell me what you want
What you really, really want

154
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,912
I'll tell you what I want
What I really, really want

155
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,115
So tell me what you want
What you really, really want...

156
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,485
Ralph, are you almost finished?
- I finished before we came in.

157
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,989
All right.
Now we can get back on the bus and on...

158
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,827
All aboard?

159
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,830
Hey, Skinner.
Want to see our impression of you?

160
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,533
Well, I guess I could use
an affectionate homage.

161
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,674
All right, stay calm, boys. Oh, God!

162
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,044
We're at the corner of Cesar Chavez Way
and Martin Luther King Blvd!

163
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,144
BART: Ay, caramba!

164
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,650
Homie, what are you doing home so early?

165
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,185
Marge, I won't bore you with the truth.

166
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,164
All I can say is that until 3:00 p.m.

167
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:10,456
We must avoid all
accidents and injuries...

168
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,024
...or we're all going to the poorhouse.

169
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,794
You mean 'back to the poorhouse.'

170
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,961
Fine.'Back.'

171
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,898
And we can't let anyone else
get hurt on our property.

172
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,067
I don't want anyone to ever get hurt.

173
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,968
Me, too, baby. But we gotta get real.

174
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,370
We can discuss it later.

175
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,573
Right now, while you're here,
you can help host my book club.

176
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:33,028
Book club? That's the most stupid,
boring thing ever! Thank you!

177
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,218
Now I would never say a bad word
about Cletus and Brandine,

178
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,189
but I hear he's been feeding slop
to another woman's pig.

179
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,596
I've been cleaved!

180
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:57,172
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're totally liable!

181
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,506
Yeah.

182
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,976
I mean, no!

183
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,752
LISA: Maybe I should just move on
to question two.

184
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,721
Question two, using what you learned
in question one...

185
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,695
Lisa, like Captain Kirk,
I'm not supposed to interfere.

186
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,731
But like T.J. Hooker,
I say what is on my mind.

187
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,167
If you don't know the answer, just guess.

188
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,136
This test penalizes guessing.

189
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,872
It does? All right, nobody guess!

190
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:37,843
Just be right! Get down on your knees,
pray to your God, and ask him...

191
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:43,783
No, demand he tell you the answer!
And if he won't, he is no God of yours!

192
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,353
What's your plan now, skin rash?

193
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,855
My name isn't skin rash.
It's Principal Skinner.

194
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,159
And you will address me as such.
- Sure thing, Such.

195
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,060
I'll deal with your insubordinate
wordplay later.

196
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,858
My first duty is to
get you boys to safety.

197
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,698
And that's... Where's Ralph?

198
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
I'm playing with Elmo!

199
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:20,663
Okay. I just have to keep these tipsy
witches safe for 10 more seconds!

200
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:26,219
Van Johnson was never half the man
Van Heflin was.

201
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,993
Knife!

202
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,493
MR. BURNS: Apaches!

203
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,295
Mr. Burns!

204
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:07,933
Why do terrible things always happen
to wonderful people at 3:01 p. M?

205
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,688
Which, for the record,
is the correct time.

206
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,040
So, plans for the weekend?

207
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,416
Marge, are you mad
I forgot to send in the payment?

208
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,152
No, sweetie. At this point in a marriage,

209
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,189
a wife should know what her husband
can do and what he can't.

210
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,858
Who was I to think you could
mail an envelope?

211
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:39,078
Baby, I hope you got snuggle insurance
because I'm about to file a claim!

212
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,712
Bart, do you have your slingshot?

213
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,748
No, sir.
- I see it in your back pocket!

214
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,318
Just don't stretch it out.
- I was once a boy, and like all boys...

215
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,753
You like all boys?

216
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,854
Ha-ha!

217
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,754
Shut up!
A child is in danger under my aegis.

218
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,858
Ha-ha?

219
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,176
Run, Ralph! Run!
- Okay!

220
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,563
Time to do what I've never done
as principal. Something!

221
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,903
Skinner's spazzing out!
- I'm not spazzing out.

222
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,472
I'm using the principle of conservation
of angular momentum...

223
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,107
...to turn the container!

224
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,207
BOYS: Oh!

225
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,047
That is so cool. That's the kind of stuff
they should teach in school.

226
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,248
SEYMOUR: We do teach it in school!

227
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,118
You're too busy eating sugar snacks
and horsing around!

228
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:11,318
He's right. Learning can teach you things.
- Education rules!

229
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,270
'But I reckon I got to light out
for the Territory ahead of the rest,

230
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,308
'because Aunt Sally she's going
to adopt me and sivilize me,

231
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,063
'and I can't stand it.
I been there before.'

232
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,546
That book was awesome!

233
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,781
ALL: Uh-huh.

234
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,975
Next stop, Springfield Elementary!

235
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:44,417
Skinner! Otto! Bullies!
The 'cowabunga' kid!

236
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,518
And the wee nitwit!
It's so good to see you all!

237
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,467
All done.

238
00:18:55,567 --> 00:19:00,497
And I've got two minutes
to take care of these stray marks.

239
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,107
Well, that's it.
- Uh-huh.

240
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,810
The test is almost over.
And I haven't done a thing.

241
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,279
I've blown my whole future.
- Right.

242
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:12,749
Well, maybe it'll be more
fun to be a regular, average,

243
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,851
stay-at-home...

244
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,755
This test is a joke!

245
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:17,856
Huh?

246
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:18,957
Skinner?

247
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:23,328
Today I received an education
in how children really learn.

248
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:27,566
By seeing their principal run around
on top of a shipping container.

249
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,637
So children, put down your answer sheet
and drop that number two.

250
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,408
Yes, I know what that means.
I've learned so much today.

251
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,645
This is my school,
and I'm throwing out the test!

252
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,147
Hooray! I'm a brainy outcast again!

253
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,152
And finally, effective immediately,

254
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,488
I'm overturning this school's ban
on dancing!

255
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,789

256
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,756
Kick off your Sunday shoes

257
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,589
Please, Louise

258
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,425
Pull me off of my knees

259
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,795
Jack, get back

260
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,892
C'mon before we crack

261
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,494
Lose your blues

262
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,097
Everybody, cut footloose

263
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,510
Footloose

264
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,477
Kick off your Sunday shoes

265
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,276
Please, Louise

266
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,078
Pull me off of my knees

267
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,653
Jack, get back

268
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,484
C'mon before we crack

269
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,219
Lose your blues

270
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,262
Everybody, cut footloose
