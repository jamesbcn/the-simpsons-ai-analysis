{\an8}(kids chattering playfully, laughing)

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,632
{\an8}These kids' birthday parties
have gotten out of control.

14
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,762
{\an8}How can a normal family compete?

15
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,339
{\an8}They rented chairs.

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,514
{\an8}The kind with puffy seats!

17
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,553
{\an8}And check out this gift bag.

00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,466
{\an8}Full-size candy bars,

{\an8}hummingbird in a plastic bag,

00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,437
{\an8}a CD of The Gay Men's Chorus

{\an8}singing "Happy Birthday, Milhouse."

22
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,267
{\an8}Dad, I want self-driving mini-cars
at my next birthday!

23
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,397
{\an8}To the petting zoo!

24
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,395
{\an8}That would cost a fortune!

25
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,987
{\an8}Who do you think I am,
a professional bowler?

26
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,744
{\an8}It's worth it to see my son

27
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,496
{\an8}as spoiled and ungrateful
as the richest brat in town.

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,670
{\an8}Dad, you were supposed
to cut this cheese

29
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,919
{\an8}in the shape of Pokémon characters.

30
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,461
You said you wanted Disney's Muppets!

00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,008
This birthday party
arms race is unsustainable.

34
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:39,215
Unless... the sanest man in town
declared war on these parties

35
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,017
in a last best attempt
to bring things back to normal.

36
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,112
I will secretly destroy
these children's birthdays,

37
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,898
or die trying.

{\an8}Rice cakes?!

41
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,674
{\an8}I pronounce this party dead.

52
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:31,032
{\an8}I was the last kid on Earth

{\an8}-(hums)
-Homer Simpson,

54
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,454
{\an8}do you know anything about
these epic birthday fails?

55
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,121
{\an8}(high-pitched voice)
Just what I read in the papers.

56
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,039
{\an8}You did suck the helium
out of all these balloons!

57
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,789
{\an8}(high-pitched voice) All right, Marge,
maybe I did cut the strings

58
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,171
{\an8}on a few party hats,
but when I was a kid,

59
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,628
{\an8}a birthday party was nothing more
than a supermarket cake

60
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,669
{\an8}and sticking pins in a donkey's butt.

61
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,712
{\an8}(clears throat)

62
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,755
{\an8}(normal voice)
And we looked forward to it

63
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,219
{\an8}for one whole year.

64
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,720
{\an8}And the gift bag was

65
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,471
{\an8}you didn't need a frickin' gift bag,

66
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,433
{\an8}because you just went
to a frickin' party!

67
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,684
{\an8}You have a point.

68
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,555
{\an8}But when the bounce house renters

69
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,692
{\an8}and the pony ride operators
find out what you've done...

70
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,980
{\an8}Mm....

71
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,573
{\an8}(scoffs)
I'm not afraid of Big Birthday.

72
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,114
(shrieks) Big Birthday!

73
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,865
You have meddled with
the primal forces of nurture,

74
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:26,292
Mr. Simpson, and I won't have it!

75
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,922
Do you think you just stopped
a few lavish parties?

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, no, sir.

77
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:34,054
There is simply one endless
birthday celebration

78
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,470
where everyone gets a gift bag

79
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,549
and no parent gets off easy.

80
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,756
Do you think this country
makes cars anymore?

81
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,636
Do you think we smelt steel?

82
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,813
No. The only thing we do

83
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,442
is throw elaborate children's cotillions

84
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,359
with enormous inedible cakes

85
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,978
out from whence Yale graduates pop!

86
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,648
ALL: Eh.

87
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,816
Mr. Simpson, the very fabric
of our existence is birthdays!

88
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,657
The quarks and bosons of your soul?

89
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,123
Birthdays!

90
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,713
You have tried to unwind the world,

91
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,920
and you... will... atone!

92
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,881
-Sorry.
-You will be sorry.

93
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,132
We are officially blacklisting you,
my friend.

94
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,675
Your children will never have
a balloon animal maker

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,890
or customized cake again!

96
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,022
BOTH: (gasp) No!

97
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,889
(crying) No-oh-oh-oh!

98
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,896
I don't want to live.

99
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,149
Not their birthdays! Take Easter!

100
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,071
Easter's nothing.

101
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,029
Geez, kids,

102
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,070
I guess you've had your last birthday.

103
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,623
You're gonna stay your current ages
for the rest of your lives.

104
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,329
Please. I'll do anything.

105
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,539
All right.

106
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,908
The next birthday that comes up
in this town is, uh,

107
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,667
Rod Flanders,

108
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,918
and you have to throw him a party.

109
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,042
(groans) Oh.

110
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,458
Um, how bad do you kids want birthdays?

111
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,667
Dad!

112
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,426
How bad do you
want to sleep in Saturdays?

113
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,719
(banging loudly)

114
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,472
Hey, hey, hey, I was just kidding around.

115
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,724
You know that. I was just...

116
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,016
-You have a deal.
-Let me make this clear.

117
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,770
This event has to be magical.

118
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,813
-You mean, hire a magician?
-No, no, no. Magical.

119
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:19,147
Magical events
change people's lives forever.

120
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,065
{\an8}(plane sputtering)

121
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,999
Welcome to Rod Flanders' birthday party.

122
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,462
I'm your host Homer Simpson,
and I can't take it anymore!

123
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,088
Stupid golden age of flight!

124
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,052
Mmm. I love you, mean neighbor!

Thanks for coming out and...

131
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,744
Abe Simpson?!

132
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:12,246
That's Mach Ridley,
my old Air Force buddy!

133
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,870
You said you were in the Army.

134
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,496
You said you were in the Navy.

135
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,503
That's the kind of mix-up
that used to happen

136
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,335
when I was in the Marines.

137
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,420
So, what brings you boys to Springfield?

138
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,047
Uh, we just want to make sure
kids have a chance

139
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,844
to meet one of the lovely ladies

140
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,848
that brought freedom to the world.

141
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,430
Why are planes and boats always women?

142
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,386
Because they require a lot of upkeep

143
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,646
and a firm hand at the controls.

144
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,688
I knew there'd be
a sexist joke behind it.

145
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,732
I knew it!

146
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,475
Abe, can you join us for a drink?

147
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,686
I'm sorry, guys.

148
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,316
My dad can't handle that much excitement.

149
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,164
Please, son.
I want to gab about the days

150
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,950
when nurses kissed ya
instead of beating ya.

151
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,914
Now, Dad,
memory lane's not what it used to be.

152
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,535
If you hang out with your old buddies,

153
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,132
it'll remind you of when
you were a proud stallion

154
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,749
instead of a broken-down nag.

155
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,257
(neighs sadly, sputters)

156
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,929
That's the lack of spirit.

157
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,798
(whimpers)

158
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,386
Look at how he treats his own father.

159
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,472
Like we used to treat P.O.W.s

160
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,518
when the Red Cross wasn't looking.

161
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,891
(laughter)

162
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,058
Boys, I think we have one last mission.

163
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,898
(mechanical whirring)

164
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,610
Make a wish, Roddy.

165
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,736
I'll never grow up and marry Daddy!

166
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,323
(laughter)

167
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,828
(Dutch accent) Very amusing.

168
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,830
Whoa!

169
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,333
I've seen all I need to see.

170
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,036
But just in case, the face.

171
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,416
-Oh!
-May I chuckle in Dutch?

172
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,753
(chuckles)

173
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,838
Bart, meet my cousin
from the Netherlands, Annika.

174
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,344
Isn't she gorgeous?

175
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,716
(laughs)

Colonel, with all due respect,

Everything's a deathtrap.

Or a dummy who tried to save him?

Homer's mother?

398
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,701
Gee, she wasn't too sunny
when I knew her.

399
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,332
Although she really cheered up
after she left you forever.
