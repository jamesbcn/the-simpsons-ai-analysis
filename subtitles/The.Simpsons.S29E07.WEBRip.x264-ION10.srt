1
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,267
D'oh!

2
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,840
Okily dokily.

3
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,245
Aw, our own home.

4
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,593
All right. Takeout Chinese.

5
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,328
Everyone can have
their favorite thing.

6
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,597
Bart, General Tso's chicken.

7
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,500
For Lisa, Pacifist Tso's tofu.

8
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,102
For Maggie, Kung Pao Cheerios.

9
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,505
And, Homer,
I've got your favorite...

10
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,106
Favorite? That's my favorite.

11
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,108
MSG.

12
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,680
Ah, needs salt.

13
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,151
Y'ello.

14
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,486
Ahoy-hoy, Simpson.

15
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,188
I have four seats to tonight's
basketball joust,

16
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,323
and you were
at the top of my list.

17
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,868
So, what do you say?

18
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,103
Thank you, Mr. Burns.

19
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,105
Oh, boy, courtside seats.

20
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,007
I feel like
Billy Crystal's doctor.

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,108
Who was it?

22
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,110
You'll never believe it.
We just got...

23
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,946
Homer, wait.
You don't want to go with them.

24
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,315
Why not? They're my family.

25
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,517
Sweetie, I know that
you're talking to your brain.

26
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,486
Why don't you just do
whatever your heart tells you?

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,121
Not that guy.

28
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
I'm numb.

29
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,925
Chest pains!

30
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,197
Just go to the game
with your friends.

31
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,032
Brain, you're the greatest.

32
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,834
Is there anything
I can do for you?

33
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,002
Yeah, you could read a book
once in a while.

34
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,538
D'oh!

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,842
Carl, I got courtside seats!

36
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,010
Lenny, I got courtside seats!

37
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,146
Barney, I got courtside seats!

38
00:02:59,179 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm in.

39
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,815
Who's on trial?

40
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,352
You guys got courtside seats?
I'd love to go.

41
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,287
Just let me lock up
the good liquor.

42
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,360
Sorry, we only have
four tickets.

43
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,061
Me, Lenny, Carl and Barney.

44
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,696
You really don't want me?

45
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,498
I thought we was friends.

46
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,066
Yeah, we did too.

47
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,901
Then we realized
you were serving us beer

48
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,069
that's mostly suds.

49
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,905
Also, your chicken wings
weren't chicken.

50
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,907
Hey, meat's meat.
Although none of it was meat.

51
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,342
Look, hey, where we going
with this?

52
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,077
You're not invited, Moe.

53
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,179
Hey, wha...?

54
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,947
Not invited, not invited.

55
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,617
Who's on trial?

56
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,931
I am truly alone
in this world.

57
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,100
No, you're not.

58
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,936
Thanks,
Anti-Suicide Keychain.

59
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,237
You're welcome.

60
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,739
I care about you...

61
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,140
Moe Szyslak...

62
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,875
very much.

63
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,451
Moe, about last night...

64
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,119
Yeah, on the house, fellas.

65
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,323
And I got new cocktail napkins

66
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,224
that ain't just
unpaid parking tickets.

67
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,159
See? Yeah, huh?

68
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,761
How about that?

69
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,631
Why you being so nice to us
after we rejected you?

70
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:26,834
Well, maybe the problem
wasn't youse, maybe it was mees.

71
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,169
So, I'se, uh,
sprucing up the bar,

72
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,972
trying to make things nice,
you know, like they used to be.

73
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,943
Hey! It's the Pin Pals,
our old bowling team!

74
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,845
Those were great times.

75
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,613
Them were the best times.

76
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,949
Closer than brothers,
we was, says I.

77
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,018
Then Apu had his octopuses,
and suddenly he didn't have time

78
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,955
to bowl with his buddies
five nights a week.

79
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,123
But as I said, great times.

80
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,631
Guys, I think we should
reform the Pin Pals,

81
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:01,168
but this time with me,
Lenny, Carl and Moe!

82
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,103
Oh, guys, I would love to!

83
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,639
But I can't bowl no more.

84
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:08,141
I got beer-pull tunnel syndrome.

85
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,081
Another, please.

86
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,387
It's a little short.

87
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,157
I guess you'll have to ask
Barney to bowl with ya's.

88
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,694
- Do they have beer?
- Yes.

89
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,029
To bowling!

90
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,631
<i>I get knocked down</i>

91
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,999
<i>But I get up again</i>

92
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,167
<i>You're never
gonna keep me down...</i>

93
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,905
Moe, this is for you.

94
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,076
- What do you say?
- Coach? Terrific!

95
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,079
I love screaming at people
who are trying their best.

96
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,681
To Moe!

97
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,316
What are you doing?
Don't drink that.

98
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,718
You're in training.

99
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,052
<i>The boys are back in town</i>

100
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,087
<i>Boys are back in town...</i>

101
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,092
A lot of music in this episode.

102
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,294
<i>The boys are back in town</i>

103
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,064
<i>The boys are back in town</i>

104
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,499
<i>Boys are back in town</i>

105
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,067
<i>The boys are back in town</i>

106
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,702
<i>The boys are back</i>

107
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,582
<i>The boys are back in town</i>

108
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,083
<i>Boys are back in town</i>

109
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,789
<i>I said the boys
are back in town</i>

110
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,425
<i>The boys are back in town...</i>

111
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,628
Okay, sidekicks,
back in our shadows.

112
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,136
<i>Hallelujah</i>

113
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,138
<i>Hallelujah</i>

114
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,629
We made it, boys.

115
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:12,399
Going to the state finals
in Capital City!

116
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,838
Sorry, that's where we store
our extra balls.

117
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,773
Quick! Rest his head!

118
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,616
All right, the state finals.

119
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,919
If we win this, the next
tournament is on ESPN8.

120
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,087
All right, guys,
don't be yokels.

121
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,490
Just act like
you seen it all before.

122
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,091
Holy crap!

123
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,477
It says we're on lane 17.

124
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,013
Wow! Topiary lane numbers.

125
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,282
I'll bet they're plastic.

126
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,818
Yep, they are,
but don't tell management.

127
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,121
So I guess we're playing
you guys, huh?

128
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,657
Best two out of three.

129
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,125
I'm Reynolds.
We're high-frequency traders.

130
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,562
I was the model for
The Wolf of Wall Street.

131
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:17,164
I was the model
for American Psycho.

132
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,969
I was a model for toe fungus
in a Dr. Scholl's commercial.

133
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,805
- And I was...
- I'll give you $100 to stop talking.

134
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,174
Deal!

135
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,077
Hey, and here's a hundred
for you for looking at me

136
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,013
like I am the most
amazing thing you ever saw.

137
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,883
I think I'm giving you
a $500 look.

138
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,251
Well, here's $400,
and screw you.

139
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:42,723
Wow. I finally found
my path in life, socio.

140
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,025
Hey, Harold, buddy.

141
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,060
You know, I was wondering...

142
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,564
Excuse me.
Why cheeseburgers?

143
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:53,066
The cheese holds it together
in flight. Duh.

144
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,103
I mean, why do you throw them
at good people?

145
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,437
Question time is over.

146
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,406
Really hope that social worker
pays better

147
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,941
by the time you grow up.

148
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,776
Social worker.

149
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,012
Hey.
This little dingus gets it.

150
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,614
All right, little man.

151
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,049
From now on,
we're gonna call you McDingus.

152
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,118
You're treating me like dirt!

153
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,620
I belong!

154
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,657
I'm wearing a new hat!

155
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,229
I'm gonna show you
that the one thing in the world

156
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,765
that you're a little bit
good at, I'm better.

157
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,999
Okey-doke.

158
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:29,970
Damn it!

159
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,238
All right, now, listen to me.

160
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,106
These stuffed suits
don't stand a chance

161
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,875
against us working joes.

162
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,810
- Because we got...
- Moxie?

163
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,211
- No.
- Grit?

164
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,780
Nah, we're pretty grit-less.

165
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,414
Well, what have we got?

166
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,050
My stepdad is Lebanese.

167
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,752
We are a damn rainbow!

168
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,986
Yeah!

169
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,161
We win. We win!

170
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,963
The first out of three!

171
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,798
I haven't been this confident

172
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,167
since I saw La La Land
win Best Picture

173
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,835
and turned off my TV.

174
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,070
Good win, you guys.

175
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,104
Lunch is on us.

176
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,740
Wow! Is that a Visa
double diamond card?

177
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,442
Yep. Doesn't have to be
inserted or swiped.

178
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,412
It just knows.

179
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,147
It can sense that you're poor.

180
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,019
Once again they substitute
rhino for narwhal.

181
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,454
It's like they think
we won't notice.

182
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,992
Thanks for lunch.

183
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,995
And now you'll be
eating crow for dessert.

184
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,963
Side note...
I have actually eaten crow.

185
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,332
It is not bad.
Tastes like seagull.

186
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:36,036
Chang-stein, I bet you
that I can break down

187
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:40,841
this loser right here
in, oh, 15 seconds.

188
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:44,978
Moe, I would like to ask you
about your last birthday.

189
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,546
Why?
What have you heard?

190
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,848
Did you have a party?

191
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,349
No, sir.

192
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,218
- Cake?
- No.

193
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,787
Ah, man, it looks like
he's tearing Moe a new one.

194
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,522
Well, most of his old ones
are pretty bad,

195
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,957
so that could be a good thing.

196
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,658
So, did you leave your house?

197
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,293
No.

198
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,328
Any phone calls?

199
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,296
- Yes.
- Meant for you?

200
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,033
No!

201
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,002
I pretended to be someone
who was interested

202
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,839
in carpet cleaning.

203
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,644
That's time, and he is
definitely crying, so you win.

204
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,513
Bart, you don't want
to be with these guys.

205
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,849
They're monsters.

206
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,084
Hey, their 401Ks
are monsters.

207
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,720
Do you even know
what a 401K is?

208
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,488
I assume it's a gun.

209
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,490
Yeah, well, I may not have much,

210
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,860
but I got some things
that matter, huh?

211
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,095
My bar, my friends,
my good name.

212
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,529
Hear! Hear!

213
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,099
All right, well, if you believe
in your friends so much,

214
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,935
how about we make
a little wager on the match?

215
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,872
- Oh, can I bet on youse to win?
- No.

216
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,875
Careful, Moe.
I got a bad feeling about this.

217
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,277
Just leave us be, huh?

218
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,080
All right, how about this?
If we win the next two games,

219
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,116
your bar is ours,
and you have to change

220
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,951
your good name.

221
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:00,187
I got a bad feeling.

222
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,189
Bad feeling, bad feeling...

223
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,961
But if I win, I want something
I can share with my friends.

224
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,931
Something only a rich guy
like you can give us.

225
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,466
Let's do this.

226
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,103
Look at me, Moe Szyslak,
shaking hands with a guy

227
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:19,139
wearing a shirt worth more than
I'll earn in my entire life.

228
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:23,276
It feels like
I'm shaking hands with a squid.

229
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,279
No, the squid has
a much firmer grip.

230
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,782
Hey, Pin Gals.

231
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:31,084
Wha...?

232
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,787
Hey, hey, hey, we ain't afraid
of no bowling shirts.

233
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,989
They're not shirts,
it's compression wear,

234
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,825
which increases blood flow
to our arms

235
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,592
and decreases wind resistance.

236
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,797
Oh, yeah!

237
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,565
They know two-handed bowling.

238
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,967
Hey, we been hustled!

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,102
Huh, if you can't trust
hedge fund guys,

240
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,137
who can you trust?

241
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,341
Nice toss.

242
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,143
Nobody likes suck-ups.

243
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:58,145
All right? Cheeseburger.

244
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,114
I want to help you
stand up to them.

245
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,349
But they're traders.

246
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,684
All we know is
how to collect information.

247
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,854
Everyone has a weak spot.

248
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,957
We will aggregate
their emotional responses

249
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,459
and run a regression
through the data.

250
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,461
Thanks for dumbing it
down for us.

251
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,496
Polish your balls?

252
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,598
Man, this alley does everything.

253
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,201
Oh, I don't work for the alley.

254
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,403
No, indeed.

255
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,276
Bart?

256
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,278
Hey, Mom, I got
a question for you.

257
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,947
- Am I too young to start drinking vodka?
- Yes.

258
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,049
Wish you would've told
me that an hour ago.

259
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,951
Here's a little
don't tell Homer money.

260
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,787
If you love money
with all your heart,

261
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,789
the money will never
love you back.

262
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,858
Will having no money
make me happy?

263
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,994
No.

264
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,795
Does Bill Gates love his wife?

265
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,031
Melinda? Of course he does.

266
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,501
They started a foundation
that does wonderful things.

267
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,503
- With money, right?
- Yes.

268
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,739
So, money's the answer
for everything.

269
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,375
Have a C-note, sweetheart.

270
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,277
She gets it.

271
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,084
Whew, they really
kicked our butts.

272
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:14,087
I'm gonna lose
my bar and my name.

273
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:16,156
No Moe, no tavern, nothing.

274
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,658
I'm gonna jump into
that empty elevator shaft!

275
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,993
Moe, no!

276
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,500
I just... I can't win.

277
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,438
Oh, yeah, now we're
getting somewhere.

278
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,385
All right, we've come
to that time...

279
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,520
the time where I give
that inspirational speech

280
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,122
I've been keeping in my pocket.

281
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,625
You have given
this lonely little man

282
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,295
a reason to get up
every single day,

283
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,864
and that is why
I love youse, Marge.

284
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,766
I mean Pin Pals,
Pin Pals.

285
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,402
And we got a secret weapon.

286
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,637
This guy is sober.

287
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,975
I am, because of the love
of your sister.

288
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,442
Now, just so you know,
that was,

289
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,111
that was a catfish thing, right?

290
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,879
What's a catfish thing?

291
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,914
I'll explain it to you
after the match.

292
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,083
Just don't drink.

293
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,785
You know how
Miriam hates it.

294
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:22,255
You know, you sister looks
just like Jennifer Lawrence.

295
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,158
And all her pictures say
Getty Images.

296
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,427
Yeah, that's a problem
with your computer.

297
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,896
Just stay sober, huh?

298
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:43,043
Hey, have you ever tasted
liquid gold?

299
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,551
You realize that was
a thousand-dollar swallow.

300
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,756
Return to me.

301
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,245
<i>Yeah</i>

302
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,491
Oh, what do you want?

303
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,460
Fair warning,
we have combed through

304
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,996
all the emotional data on you
to find your soft targets.

305
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,865
What the hell
are you talking about?

306
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:42,169
You'll see, in just 15 seconds.

307
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,504
Reynolds,
artificial intelligence

308
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,407
is just three months away
from taking your job.

309
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,410
Without my job,
I'm just a douche.

310
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,479
You don't know
that the other two

311
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,381
are sleeping with your wife.

312
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,550
I thought you were, but you?!

313
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,586
You're all about your BMW,

314
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,089
but you couldn't afford
the sport package.

315
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,228
And I win, just like
all good people always win.

316
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:11,030
- McDingus.
- Yes, Father?

317
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:14,000
Throw this at your sister.

318
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,168
You won't do it, Bart.

319
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,003
Why not?
It's you and it's me,

320
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,005
and it wastes food.

321
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,007
You won't do it
because, deep down,

322
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,076
there's something weird
that connects us.

323
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,177
You're crazy.

324
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,912
Neither of us admits it,

325
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,080
but it's there.

326
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,116
I hold myself out to you.

327
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:32,519
Go on, make my face
the home of the Whopper.

328
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,721
I can't do it.

329
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,923
You do like me. You do!

330
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,393
And we'll always keep this
burger as a symbol of our fr...

331
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:45,298
May I wax your alley?

332
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,134
Will you get out of here?!

333
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,902
All right, this is it, the
tenth frame, the final frame.

334
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,972
The frame where you start
looking for your regular shoes.

335
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,976
All right, Barney,
just do your thing. No pressure.

336
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,445
Here's a picture of my sister

337
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,480
in the movie
Silver Linings Playbook.

338
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,081
Take a look.

339
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,451
Hey, you guys liquored him up!

340
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:08,255
Don't worry, Moe, I can still
win the spelling bee.

341
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,822
Recidivism.

342
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,091
R...

343
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,327
Because of
this idiot, Homer,

344
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,962
we need three strikes from you.

345
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,331
I just want to know what
it's like to be a winner, huh?

346
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,599
Just one time.

347
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,568
What about that
Women in Film award?

348
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,736
No, I stole that.

349
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,706
Okay, Moe, for you, I'll do it.

350
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:34,046
We're gonna win. I'm not gonna
have to start over again!

351
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,619
Because starting over,
what would that even mean?

352
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,039
That could be my reality.

353
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,275
Oh, my God,
I got to lose this match.

354
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,710
Homer, no!

355
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,112
- Give me the ball!
- I need it to bowl!

356
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,714
I don't want to win!

357
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,516
You're the worst coach ever!

358
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,251
Just give me the damn ball!

359
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,531
What's wrong, Moe?

360
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,066
- Yeah, we won.
- Nothing. I just got to go back

361
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,302
to the worst thing
in the world, huh?

362
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,504
Being me.

363
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,841
The guy you wouldn't even invite
to a basketball game.

364
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,412
Wha...
Did somebody say wait?

365
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,714
- No.
- Well, I wouldn't come back now

366
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,316
if you begged me.

367
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,151
- Wait!
- Yeah?

368
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,586
Just making a point.

369
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,759
Surprise!

370
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,427
You guys are my friends.

371
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,996
- That's right.
- We sure are.

372
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,031
And we're gonna have
a big party!

373
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,901
Right after we get back
from the basketball game.

374
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,139
Salt to the earth there.

375
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,645
All right, guys,
since we won the championship,

376
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,914
those hedge fund do-rags
have to deliver

377
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,551
an experience for me and my pals
that only they can bring.

378
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,119
When does it start?

379
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,655
Right about... now.

380
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,331
Welcome to how I always feel.
