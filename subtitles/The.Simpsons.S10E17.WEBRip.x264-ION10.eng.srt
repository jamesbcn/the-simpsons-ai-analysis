00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,214
CHORUS: <i>♪ The Simpsons ♪</i>

00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,347
(bell ringing)

3
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,113
(whistle blowing)

4
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,318
(beeping)

5
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,869
(playing the blues)

6
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,274
(honking horn)

7
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,402
D'oh!

8
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,442
-(screams)
-(tires screeching)

9
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,107
Hmm.

10
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,495
{\an8}-(chewing loudly)
-MARGE: Hmm.

11
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,214
{\an8}(chuckling)
So I said to that nurse,

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,550
{\an8}"You can take your free
tetanus shot and shove it."

13
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,179
{\an8}Well, you told her, Dad.

14
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,388
{\an8}You better... believe I did.

15
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,345
{\an8}(grunts)

16
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,346
{\an8}Ahh! Ohh.

17
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,682
{\an8}You still haven't told us
why Lenny bit you.

18
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,148
{\an8}Well, I really gave him
no choice, you see.

19
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,109
Lousy, meat-eating scum.

20
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,229
-(all gasping)
-BART: Huh?

21
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,645
Not you.

22
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,320
(chewing loudly)

23
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,901
{\an8}I'm going over to protest
this disgusting new restaurant

24
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,157
{\an8}called The Slaughterhouse.

25
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,949
{\an8}It's decorated
with hanging steer carcasses

26
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,203
{\an8}and a fountain of blood.

27
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,664
{\an8}Oh, I heard about that place
on The Red Grocer.

28
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,706
{\an8}The worst part is,
you pick out your own cow

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,331
{\an8}and they kill it
right in front of you.

30
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,797
{\an8}Well, maybe the animals
don't mind, honey.

31
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,303
{\an8}They might enjoy being
the center of attention.

32
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,970
{\an8}I think I read somewhere
that cows like being killed.

33
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,721
{\an8}Wait. There's a place
like that in Springfield?

34
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,807
{\an8}Then why are we eating
this crap?

35
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,853
{\an8}(grunts)

36
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,429
{\an8}Come on, everybody.

37
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,937
{\an8}We're going
to The Slaughterhouse.

38
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,686
{\an8}You didn't need
to knock the food on the floor.

39
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,861
{\an8}Didn't I?

40
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,449
{\an8}(cows mooing)

41
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,577
{\an8}Wow, it's even more wonderful

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,410
{\an8}than Lisa said.

43
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,582
{\an8}Oh, whoa,

44
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,043
{\an8}a complimentary
basket of hooves.

45
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,588
{\an8}Hmm. Beef salad,
beef on the cob,

46
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,919
{\an8}beef-fried beef.

47
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,049
{\an8}Is there anything on the menu
that isn't meat?

48
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,591
{\an8}Ha. Not likely.

49
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,223
{\an8}Cool. Even this menu
is made of meat.

50
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,394
{\an8}It's an entire chicken
pounded flat.

51
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,850
{\an8}How clever.

52
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,894
{\an8}The kids' menu's on the beak.

53
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,104
{\an8}Hmm. I think I'll take...

54
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,772
{\an8}oh, that one.

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,350
{\an8}-(gunshot)
-(cow mooing)

56
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,608
{\an8}No, he's a bit listless,
isn't he?

57
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,030
Give me...
Oh, that spirited fellow.

58
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,239
-(gunshot)
-(cow mooing)

59
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,779
Ooh. He didn't put up
much of a fight.

60
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,237
Why don't you pick one for me?

61
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,368
-(gunshot)
-(cow mooing)

62
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,331
On second thought,

63
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,833
I'll just have a glass of milk.

64
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,909
From that cow.

65
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:26,867
(surprised)

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,540
-(gunshot)
-(cow mooing)

67
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,714
{\an8}HOMER: Wait a minute. Is this
the biggest steak you've got?

68
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,214
Seventy-two ounces?

69
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,716
I thought this was supposed
to be a steak house,

70
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,384
not a little
girlie, underpantsy,

71
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,888
pink doily, tea-party place.

72
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,137
Well, there is one steak

73
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,932
that's only available
by special request.

74
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,135
Uh. We call it,
uh, sir loin-a-lot.

75
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,186
It's, uh, the size
of a boogie board.

76
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,399
Ooh, I'll have that one.

77
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,809
And to drink... meatballs.

78
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,018
Very good, sir.

79
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,781
(ringing)

80
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,403
Ladies and gentlemen,

81
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,736
this brave man has accepted
the sir loin-a-lot challenge.

82
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,372
He will pit his stomach
against 16 pounds

83
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,080
of indomitable tenderloin.

84
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,580
(applause)

85
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,622
They like me because I'm brave.

86
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,075
Only two people have ever
finished the whole thing.

87
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,286
(people gasping)

88
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,128
Uh, if you want
some friendly advice, pal,

89
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,338
I wouldn't tackle
the big one right away.

90
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,383
Oh, yeah?
What do you know about it?

91
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,644
(cows mooing)

92
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:29,813
Hmm.

93
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,904
It's you!

94
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,612
You're him. You're Tony Randall.

95
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,820
Heh. Red Barclay's my name.

96
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,607
I'm a trucker and I've eaten
steaks from coast to coast

97
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,985
with taters and toast.

98
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,321
Take my advice,

99
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,446
this one's not for greenhorns.

100
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,783
Greenhorns?

101
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,826
Who's a greenhorn?

102
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,445
What's a greenhorn?

103
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,248
It's an insult. Sock him, Dad.
Sock everybody.

104
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,082
Oh, you're just jealous
'cause you don't have

105
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,547
the belly for it anymore,
Mr. No-belly.

106
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,216
Mr. Hasn't-got-a-belly.

107
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,339
Well, I have just finished
a whole lamb,

108
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,846
but, uh, I reckon
I could take you to school.

109
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,142
You're on, boy.

110
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,636
(grunts)

111
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,774
(shuddering)

112
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,312
Is it safe to eat
that much food, Dr. Hibbert?

113
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,728
You know, I wouldn't
have thought so

114
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,654
before I bought 12%
of this restaurant,

115
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,243
but now I feel
a balanced diet can include

116
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,739
the occasional eating contest.

117
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,860
But what if he chokes?

118
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,986
Oh-ho-ho-ho ! Not to worry.

119
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,953
We have the latest
Heimlich machine.

120
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,704
(gagging)

121
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,913
(gasps)

122
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,497
(grunts)

123
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,173
On your left,

124
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,168
the pride of the American
trucking industry,

125
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,844
reliable Red Barclay.

126
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,303
(applause, cheers)

127
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,844
And on your right,
Homer somebody.

128
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,467
-Go, Dad! Go, go, go!
-Yeah! Come on, Homie!

129
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,265
Gluttons to your marks,

130
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,389
-and Gorge!
-(inhaling)

131
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,186
(chanting)
Chew! Chew! Chew!

132
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,402
Chew! Chew! Chew!

133
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,614
(humming)

134
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,861
No, Homer!
Don't fill up on bread!

135
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,952
Huh? Oh, right. The steak.

136
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,486
(smacking)

137
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,075
Come on, Dad, pick up the pace.

138
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,949
Chew and swallow. No savoring.

139
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,497
Must eat beef.

140
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,629
Must defeat guy I just met.

141
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,336
(smacking)

142
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,633
So much steak.

143
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,093
Lungs filling.

144
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,510
Sinuses packed with meat.

145
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,965
Oh, come on, Dad,
just 12 more pounds.

146
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,676
(groans)

147
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,144
Oh, humans are so ridiculous.

148
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,848
He's not even
halfway through Walter,

149
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,818
and he's already hallucinating.

150
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,977
(both chuckling)

151
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,777
Lousy drunks!

152
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,316
I'll show them!

153
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,525
(groans)

154
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,413
(continues to groan)

155
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,456
What's happening to me?

156
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,381
There's still food,
but I don't want to eat it.

157
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,594
I've become everything
I've ever hated.

158
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,552
(weeping)

159
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,299
-(satisfied grunt)
-(applause, cheers)

160
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,557
Winner and still champion,

161
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,231
reliable Red Barclay.

162
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,268
(applause, cheers)

163
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,771
My hat's off to you, Red.

164
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,436
You're a true American hero

165
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,899
and you did it
with style and dignity.

166
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,572
and, hey, you're not breathing.

167
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,954
Don't people usually breathe?

168
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,781
-This man is dead.
-(people gasping)

169
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,366
Looks to me like beef poisoning.

170
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,621
(concerned murmuring)

171
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,452
Probably
from some other restaurant.

172
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,827
(relieved murmuring)

173
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,504
(grunting)

174
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,090
You'd better take
one of these, too.

175
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,133
He's eaten quite a lot.

176
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,089
(tires squealing)

177
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,966
There goes the finest trucker
who ever lived.

178
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,183
He called me greenhorn.

179
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,434
I called him Tony Randall.

180
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,226
It was this thing we had.

181
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,727
In 38 years,
he never missed a shipment.

182
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,941
But I guess this is one delivery
old Red won't be making.

183
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,275
Oh, yes, he will.

184
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,319
And on time, too.

185
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,324
Oh, no. Homer, no.

186
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,950
I've got to, honey.

187
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,328
I owe it to old Red

188
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,329
as both his friend
and his killer.

189
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,205
I want to go with you, Dad.

190
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,498
Don't you have school?

191
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,634
-Don't you have work?
-Ah, <i>touché</i>.

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,920
Bye, Marge.

193
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,842
(tires screeching)

194
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,625
Aren't you going to say bye?

195
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,923
Good-bye, Homer.

196
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,796
That didn't sound
like you meant it.

197
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,093
Oh, all right.
Good-bye, sweetheart.

198
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Have a nice trip.

199
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,965
That's more like it.

200
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,600
So long, suckers!

201
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,561
(laughing)

202
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,101
(honking horn)

203
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,357
(stuttering)

204
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,032
( Homer grunting )

205
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,863
HOMER: Why you got to...

206
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,696
(grunting)
Come on.

207
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,621
(grunting)

208
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,656
Ah. Now I'm getting
the hang of this thing.

209
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,042
I don't know why I didn't
become a trucker before.

210
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,622
Well, you're not really
a trucker now.

211
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,615
Oh, yeah?

212
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,576
My left arm says different.

213
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,537
Well, according
to Red's schedule,

214
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,837
we have to make it
to Atlanta in three days.

215
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,883
Piece of cake.

216
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,764
Just need a little
truck-driving music.

217
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,338
(music playing) <i>♪ If you want to</i>
<i>be my lover ♪</i>

218
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,512

219

220
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,426
Yeah.

221
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,019
The open road.

222
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,693
Ahh, that little punk.

223
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,193
I'll teach him some manners.

224
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,610
-(screams)
-No, Dad,

225
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,065
he wants you
to blow your horn.

226
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,110
Oh.

227
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,156
That little punk!

228
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,749
Lisa, we got another postcard
from your father.

229
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,629
"Wish you were her."

230
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,539
How many of these
is he going to send me?

231
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,711
Wow, Dad and Bart
have been everywhere.

232
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,674
They've eaten
submarine sandwiches,

233
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,467
grinders, and hoagies.

234
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,591
It's not fair.

235
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,347
Your father always gets to have
such exciting adventures.

236
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,217
Maybe it's time

237
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,597
we took a walk on the wild side.

238
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,441
We're buying a new doorbell?

239
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,481
A musical doorbell.

240
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,531
(creaking)

241
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,529
So many doorbells!

242
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,322
I'm in way over my head.

243
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,122
(Nelson humming)

244
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:18,954
(bell ringing)

245
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,905
(laughs)

246
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,041
(grunting)

247
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,502
Oh...

248
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,292
Great. Look at my shoes

249
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,665
and today's my evaluation
with <i>senor </i>ding-dong.

250
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,672
Excuse me, Mr... Trainee.

251
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,797
I'm trying to find
a musical doorbell.

252
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,354
(laughing) Well, you came
to the right place.

253
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,218
We got your ding-dang-dongs

254
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,505
and your do-re-mis

255
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,928
and your, uh, ha-cha-chas, huh?

256
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:43,847
(laughing)

257
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,524
(humming)

258
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,187
I'm trying to find
a particular tune.

259
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,772
It's the one that goes like...

260
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,567
(tuneless humming)

261
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,902
Mom, is this the one you want?

262
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,406
(music playing "Close to You")

263
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,620
Yes, that's it!

264
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,582
Lisa, you ought to be
a doorbell salesman.

265
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,622
Oh, that's just what I need,

266
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,004
another piranha in the tank.

00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,751

269
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,535
A little more
high test, darlin'?

270
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,299
Sure thing, Gwen.

271
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,379
I'll be right back
with your pie, hon.

272
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,510
Ah, that's a nice, friendly gal.

273
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,007
-Yeah.
-Wouldn't it be great

274
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,845
to live right here
at the truck stop?

275
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,933
Watching all the people
come and go.

276
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,477
You could have a different
best friend every day.

277
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,479
I suppose.

278
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,904
Great. Now write your mother

279
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,188
and tell her
the marriage is off

280
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,771
and then
when the paperwork is done,

281
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,726
I'll make Gwen my wife.

282
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,606
Will that be all, sweetie?

283
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,744
For now.

284
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,606
The light's on.

285
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,572
All systems are ding-dong.

286
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,447
Come on, Mom.
Let's take it for a test drive.

287
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,374
Oh, it's not a toy, Lisa.

288
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,786
We'll just have to wait
until someone comes.

289
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,536
Anyone? Anyone at all?

290
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,795
Oh! Milhouse is selling seeds
and he's coming this way...

291
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,462
Oh, the birds got him.

292
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,722
(screaming)

293
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,168
Not the face!

294
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,303
If your father was here,
there'd be process servers,

295
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,926
repo men, and bounty hunters
to beat the band.

296
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,643
Wait! People are coming!

297
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,135
I think
they're Jehovah's witnesses!

298
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,225
Yes!

299
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,106
Wait, Marlon.
You know, I just had a thought.

300
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,268
Maybe we're bothering people

301
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,856
by trying to change
their religion.

302
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,898
What if we don't have
all the answers?

303
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,106
You're right, Noreen.

304
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,399
Let's go get real jobs.

305
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,411
(grumbling)
I would have feigned interest.

306
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,711
(grunts)

307
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,674
Still no visitors.

308
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,090
It's time we opened up a can
of whup-tushy on this situation.

309
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,802
What's the number for Luigi's?

310
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,010
Dad's got it on the speed dial
under "fire."

311
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,625

312
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,387
This is it, honey.

313
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,350
We did it.

314
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,427
-Damn it!
-(sighs)

315
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,774
MARGE: Ring the bell!

316
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,892
Why? You already know
I'm here, don't you?

317
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:49,976
MARGE: Just do it.

318
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,440
Nothing doing, missy.

319
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,055
Now, do you want your half-order
of garlic bread or not?

320
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,438
No, but if you'll
just ring the...

321
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,944

-Hmm.

322
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,776
Oh, that's it.
I'm putting an end to this.

323
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,861
Lisa, no, no, don't!
It won't be the...

Uh-huh. Bet he used bait, too.

344
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,448
Relax, boy.
We're ahead of schedule.

345
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,250
Actually, we have to go

00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,772
OK, we're all set. Let's put
the pedal to the metal!

357
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,569
(tires screeching)

358
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,650
I wholeheartedly agree.

359
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,867
Oh, man, I'm really wired.
This is a big mistake.

360
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,118
I can... Oh...

361
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,239
Here comes the sleeping pills.

362
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,997
So drowsy.

363
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,159
Pep pills perking up again.

364
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,867
I could drive all...

365
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,457
night.

366
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,126
(snoring)

367
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,814
(signal bell dinging)

368
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,523
(brakes squealing)

369
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,781
(bell dings)

370
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,363
(snoring)

371
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,161
(screaming)

372
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,619
I fell asleep at the wheel!

373
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,584
(whimpers)

374
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,946
But we didn't crash.

375
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,909
(gasps) It's a miracle.

376
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,583
You'll never believe
what happened.

377
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,995
I fell asleep at the wheel

378
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,594
and the truck
drove here by itself.

379
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,380
Yeah, that Navitron
Auto-Drive system's

380
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,134
made our jobs cushier than ever.
(chuckles)

381
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,006
-The what, now?
-You know, this thing.

382
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,350
With this baby driving
your truck for you,

383
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,811
all you got to do is sit back
and feel your ass grow.

384
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,389
The trucks drive themselves?

385
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,636
Shh... Hey, hey, hey, shh...

386
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,847
Didn't your union rep tell you
about the scam we got going?

387
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,308
Oh, I'm not really a trucker,

388
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,937
so I don't talk
to the rep that often.

389
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,363
All right, listen, pal,
here's the deal,

390
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,652
you stumbled on a secret

391
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,696
that only truck drivers
are supposed to know.

392
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,280
(laughing)

393
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,565
Hey, pay attention

394
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,618
and stop looking
at that squirrel.

395
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,792
(chattering)

396
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,578
We get 40 bucks an hour
to drive these rigs.

397
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,963
You think anybody'd hire us

398
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,869
if they knew we weren't really
driving the trucks?

399
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,878
Wow!

400
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,205
You guys
are even lazier than me!

401
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,628
Well, don't worry.

402
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,091
I'll keep your secret.

403
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,472
See that you do.

404
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,389
Hey, Bart, watch me
run down this old lady.

405
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,471
Dad, no!

406
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,308
-(tires screeching)
-(grunts)

407
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,231
(beeping)

408
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,064
(screaming)

409
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,193
(laughing)

410
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,560
The second I let go
of the wheel,

411
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,187
this little wonder kicks in.

412
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,530
And if scaring old ladies

413
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,148
don't float your boat,
watch this.

414
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,322
(grunting)

415
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,238
Come on out, boy!

416
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,989
It's windy!

417
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,830
Wow, you're right, Dad!

418
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,870
It is windy!

419
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,541
Hey, look, nobody's driving!

420
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,544
-Well, will wonders never cease?
-What's that?

421
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,036
Relax, everybody.

422
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,338
The Navitron Auto-Drive system

423
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,132
is driving the truck for me.

424
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,255
But keep it a secret.

425
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,466
It's a big scam, OK?

426
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,232
What the hell?

427
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,309
Breaker, breaker,

428
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,024
looks like we got us a 10-38.

429
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,362
MAN: Uh, 10-38.

430
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,992
Uh, let's see.

431
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,448
Uh, "Outsider blabbing
about auto-drive system."

432
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,410
Well, we'll have to teach
our friend some discretion.

433
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,201
Yeah, just like we did
to Jimmy Hoffa.

434
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,906
-(chuckles)
-Hey, shut up!

435
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,496
Calling all big rigs.

436
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,001
Motormouth on highway seven.

437
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,132
You know what to do.

438
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,958
<i>-10-4.</i>
-MAN: <i>That's a big 10-4.</i>

439
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,214
-(music playing "Close to You")
-Mom, I need to get some sleep.

440
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,047
I have a test tomorrow
in birds suddenly appear.

441
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,471
I mean, English.

442
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,101
OK, OK, let me just get
the wire cutters.

443
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:36,893
Oh...

444
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,562
Your father traded our tools
for M&M's again.

445
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,604
Oh, the heck with it.
(grunts)

446
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,903
(music playing faster)

447
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,820
(dogs howling)

448
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,400
(howling continues)

449
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,954
Look, son.

450
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,745
It's one of nature's
most beautiful sights,

451
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,500
the convoy.

452
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,000
(engine revving)

453
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,125
He hit us.

454
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,001
Oh, I should've known.

455
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,384
They're hazing us

456
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,184
to initiate us into
the truckers' fraternity.

457
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,678
-(crash)
-Thank you, sir.

458
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,640
May I have another?

459
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,599
(crash)

460
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,388
Dad, they're trying to kill us.

461
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,349
Oh, why do all my trips
end like this?

462
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,436
Eat water, good buddy.

463
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,773
(screaming)

464
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,029
Whoa, look at him roll!

465
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,607
(grunting)

466
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,856
Oh, my good knife!

467
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,198
My wife's going to kill me.

468
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,782
HOMER: I think
we lost 'em, Bart.

469
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:39,874
Dad, stop!

470
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,832
(tires squealing)

471
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,251
HOMER: Uh-oh.

472
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,834
Well, well, well.

473
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,326
Looks like we got ourselves

474
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,167
a showdown, boy.

475
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,668
-All right.
-What are you doing?

476
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,005
I'm keeping a promise
to an American roadmaster.

477
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,472
-Huh?
-Red.

478
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,466
The trucker.

479
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,890
Big fat guy,
couldn't handle his steak?

480
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,394
-Oh, yeah.
-We'll get past

481
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,845
that barrier somehow.

482
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,937
Ol' Blinky here will find a way.

483
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,608
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>I can't let you do this, Red.</i>

484
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,275
<i>The risk is unacceptable.</i>

485
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,782
I'm not Red. I'm Homer.

486
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,452
-AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Got to go.</i>
-Uh-oh

487
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,952
(screams)

488
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:21,954
Dad, do something.

489
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,158
Something better!

490
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,116
-(tires screeching)
-(Homer grunting)

491
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,705
(both screaming)

492
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,763
Woo-hoo!

493
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,342
Now that man is a genuine

494
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,388
steel-belted, gear-jamming
rig jockey.

495
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,891
-That's a fact.
-Boy howdy!

496
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,273
-Boy, you can say that again.
-Yeah.

497
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,846
You know, boys,
I've been thinking.

498
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,481
Maybe it's time we ditched
the high-tech gizmos

499
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,692
and went back to driving
like our daddies did.

500
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,771
-Drunk?
-No! N-no.

501
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,318
Using our hands and our wits.

502
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,572
Yeah, sure, it's hard work
and it's lonely as hell,

503
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,284
but it has meaning and dignity.

504
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,529
Huh? What do you say?

505
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,577
Nah. Let's just find
some other scam.

506
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,173
Hey, how about
bootlegging beanie babies?

507
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,339
-Sounds good to me.
-Oh, I like that.

508
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,795
Yep, you're going
to make it, Dad.

509
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,802
And somewhere up there,
I bet Red is saying "thanks."

510
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,759
10-4, dead buddy.

511
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,891
This is Red Barclay's shipment,

512
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,436
on time, as always.

513
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,109
All right, let's see.

514
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,569
Artichokes

515
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,147
and migrant workers.

516
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,074
Looking good.

517
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,240
So, where is old Red, anyway?

518
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,735
Well, the last time I saw him,

519
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,741
he was in a big plastic bag.

520
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,703
(laughs)

521
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,663
Yeah, that sounds
like Red, all right.

522
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,584
Well, son, I guess
it's time to go home.

523
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,040
Any thoughts on how
we're going to get there?

524
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,840
No, but I'm sure
the good lord will provide.

525
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,129
Are you crazy?

526
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,837
I'm not driving a trainload
of napalm to Springfield!

527
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,046
Thank you.

528
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,852
-(music playing "Close to You")
-(crowd shouting angrily)

529
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,935
I'm really sorry, everybody,

530
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,360
but I've tried everything.

531
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,772
I'm afraid we're just going

532
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,776
to have to learn
to live with it.

533
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,902
No, no, no, no dice!

534
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,612
All right, Chimey,

535
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,526
this time,
the bell tolls for thee.

536
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,236
-Huh?
-(crowd gasping)

537
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,826
Ay-yi-yi! <i>Senor </i>ding-dong!

538
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,962
I thought you were just
a marketing gimmick.

539
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,999
There was a time
when that was true,

540
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,633
but now, I am so much more.

541
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,168
-(music stops)
-(crowd cheering)

542
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,465
Hmm... Oh, my.

543
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,969
(in Spanish) <i>Gracias, senor.</i>

544
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,137
<i>De nada!</i>

545
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,720
(in English)
If you ever need me,

546
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,812
just ring.

547
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,220
(grunts)

548
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,184
(starter chugging)

549
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,812
Does anyone have
any jumper cables?

550
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,816
(starter chugging)

551
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,236
<i>Oh, you stinking Chevy!</i>

552
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,899
-(murmuring)
-Shh!

553
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,197
