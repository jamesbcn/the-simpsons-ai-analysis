Hello, Seymour.

49
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,111
So, what's the word down
at 1 School Board Plaza?

50
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,617
We're dropping
the geography requirement.

51
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,329
The children
weren't testing well.

52
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,739
It was proving to be
an embarrassment.

53
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,407
Very good.
Back to the three "r's."

54
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,826
Two "r's" come October.

55
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,174
Hmm.

56
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,419
What do you think
of the banners?

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,460
Nothing but
transparent toadying.

58
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,054
They were the children's idea.
I tried to stop them.

59
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,880
It's always
the children's fault,

60
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,085
isn't it, Seymour?

61
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,425
Yes. Yes, it is, sir.

62
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,260

00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,767
Science geeks
not getting beat up.

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,690

lunch money for food.

65
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,099

00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,558
Uhh! Huh!

67
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,067
Ooh! Ooh!

68
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,281
Hey, I think I can squeeze
through that vent.

69
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,651
All right.

70
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,988
All right, Bart.
Do it, man.

71
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,583
Now, remember,
little dude,

72
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,165
you're our only hope.

73
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,461
Uh!

74
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,464
Ow!

75
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,545
Got him!

76
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,340
-Way to go, man!
-Ha-ha!

77
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,554
May I interest you
in a Jell-O brick, sir?

78
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,885
There's a grape
in the center.

79
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,849
Well, I'm not made
of stone.

80
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,180

81
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,974
You're not made

82
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,308
A brick, and you're
not made of... stone.

83
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,725
Ah, my beauty.

84
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,404
Wait till the
superintendent sees you.

85
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,784
Were it not a violation
of God's law,

86
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,111
I'd make you my wife.

87
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,407
Now there's a lonely man.

88
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,118
(gulp)

89
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,367
I'm new in town.

90
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,787
Be there a cool loch

91
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,085
where a lass could
wash her long red hair?

92
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,170
Nay, but there's a pool
at me apartment complex.

93
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,337
There was a rat
in the deep end

94
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,385
but we got him.

95
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,178
Ah. Lead on.

96
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,217
48... 49...

97
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,387
50.

98
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,555
Flag's up to date.

99
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,403
Very good, Seymour.

100
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,648
Now, are these children
as smart as they look?

101
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,520
{\an8}Well, let's pick one
at random.

102
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,937
{\an8}Uh... Hmm...
How about that one?

103
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,146
-You mean this boy here?
-No! No, Lisa Simpson.

104
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,027
When was the Battle
of New Orleans?

105
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,834
January 8, 1815,
two weeks after the war ended.

106
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,040
First-rate.

107
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,370
What's a battle?

108
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,214
(forced laughs)
Let's go.

109
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,870
Did that boy say
"What's a battle?"

110
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,378
No. He said
"What's that rattle?"

111
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,379
It's about
the heating ducts.

112
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,840
It sounded like "battle."

113
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,381
I've had a cold.

114
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,174
So you hear
"r's" as "b's"?

115
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,378
Yes.

116
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,427
I understand.

117
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,440
Come on, Bart.

118
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,979
Ride me.

119
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,860
I better not.

120
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,440
(clucking)

121
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,947
He's insulting
both of us.

122
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,196
Let's go.

123
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,196

124
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,076

125
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,300
Excellent.
Not a trace of urine.

126
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,011
Seymour,
you run a tight ship.

127
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,591
Well, you know
what they say, sir,

128
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,006
where there's no smoke,
there's no fire.

129
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,385
What an odd remark.

130
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,352
Why, that looks
like a 50¢ piece.

131
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,232
I'll just bend over
and get it.

132
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,977

00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,772

135
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,398
Aah!

136
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,823
No!

137
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,652
Ow, ow, ow.

138
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,157
Seymour, I was thinking
of promoting you

139
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,739
to assistant superintendent,

140
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,834
but instead, that plum
goes to Holloway.

141
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,251
Oh, but, sir,
he's a drunk.

142
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,159
-And a pill-popper.
-If I could just--

143
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,117
Silence!

144
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,957
And why is a cafeteria worker

145
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,132
posing as a nurse?

146
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,500
I get two paychecks
this way.

147
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,457
D'oh.

148
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,878
There's no detention
this time, Simpson.

149
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,886
This is the end.

150
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:30,718
You are expelled
from Springfield Elementary.

It's all so barbaric.

181
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,421
Hey, kids, how was school?

182
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,591
I learned how many drams
in a pennyweight.

183
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,750
I got expelled.

184
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,958
That's my boy.

185
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,630
Mmm... beer.

186
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,967
What?!

187
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,721
Look, Dad,
I don't need school.

188
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,643
I'll make my way
as a bootblack.

189
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,972
Shine your boots,
guv'nor?

190
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,556
No son of mine is gonna be

191
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,601
a 19th century
cockney bootblack.

192
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,845
We're gonna find
you another school.

193
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,646
Now, remember, Bart,
this is a religious school.

194
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,027
So be very careful about
what you say and do here.

195
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,324
No problemo.

196
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,577
Now, Bart,
since you're new here,

197
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,119
perhaps you'd favor us
with a Psalm.

198
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,174
How about... "Beans, Beans,
the Musical Fruit?"

199
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,879
Well, beans were a staple
of the Israelites.

200
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,090
Yes, proceed.

201
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,800
(clearing throat)

202
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,720
"Beans, beans,
the musical fruit

203
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,428
the more you eat,
the more you toot."

204
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,219
(humming)

205
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,966
Avert your eyes,
children!

206
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,938
He may take
on other forms!

207
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,690
I guess that's it.

208
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,072
I just can't be educated.

209
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,228
(sighs)

210
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,527
I can always get a job

211
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,740
testing dangerous
food additives.

212
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,241
We'd like you to try
this new diet cola.

213
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,084
We call it
Nature's Goodness.

214
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,699
-What's in it?
-2-4-desoxyprophenuramine.

215
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,672
(burps)

216
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,924
(grunting and growling)

217
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,835
Sweet.

218
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,264
Pleasing taste,
some monsterism.

219
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,299
Cool.

220
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,138
You're going to get
an education.

221
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,273
I'm going to teach you myself.

222
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,560
Marge, it's too late.

223
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,233
The boy is ten years old.

224
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,571
Let's focus our energy
on Lisa and the other one.

225
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,898
What's your problem?

226
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,323
-Whacking Day is coming.
-Whoo-hoo!

227
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,242
The greatest day
of the year.

228
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
But killing snakes is evil.

229
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,066
Maybe so, Lisa,

230
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,827
but it's part of our,
oh, so human nature.

231
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,500
Inside every man is a struggle
between good and evil

232
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,250
that cannot be resolved.

233
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,750
{\an8}<i>♪ I am evil Homer,</i>
<i>I am evil Homer ♪</i>

234
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,467
<i>♪ I am evil Homer</i>
<i>I am evil Homer... ♪</i>

235
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,099
Have a nice day
at school, Lis.

236
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,680
I'll just try and make
the best of a bad situation.

237
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,476
(stretches)

238
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,401
Ah!

239
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,939
Bart, get dressed
for school.

240
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,943
I expect you to be in your
seat when the bell rings.

241
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,033
(giggling)

242
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,781
I bought a bell.

243
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,039
-(loud clanging)
-(both yelling)

244
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,041
I think I'll unplug that.

245
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,250
I'm your new teacher.

246
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,376
My name is Mrs. Simpson.
(chuckles)

247
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,924
(uneasy chuckle)

248
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,257
(groaning)

249
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,685
(tooting)

250
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,185
I didn't do it.

251
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,573
(groans)

252
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,526
(knocking)

253
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,951
Oh, that's right.

254
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,409
I invited a guest speaker
to talk to the class.

255
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,945
Hello, children.

256
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,834
I got separated from my platoon

257
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,501
after we parachuted
into Dusseldorf.

258
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,344
So I rode out the war

259
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,799
posing as a German
cabaret singer.

260
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:17,391

262
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,561
MAN: Yoo-hoo!

263
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,399
<i>Ach, du lieber!</i>
<i>Das ist not eine booby!</i>

264
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,482
Is that story true, Grampa?

265
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,897
Well, most of it.

266
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,775
I did wear a dress
for a period in the '40s.

267
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,033
Oh, they had
designers then.

268
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,446
(garage door opening)

269
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,164
(yelling)

270
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,076
Look what I got, Marge.

271
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,044
A new whacking stick.

272
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,246
Whack!

273
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,245
Ooh!

274
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,046
Excuse me.

275
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,670
Whack, whack, whack!

276
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,676
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

277
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,838
Bart, I'd like you
to read this copy

278
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,427
of "Johnny Tremain."

279
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,892
It's a book I read
as a girl.

280
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,472
A book?
(blows a raspberry)

281
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,977
I think you might
like this.

282
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,478
It's about a boy
who goes to war.

283
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,401
His hand is deformed
in an accident.

284
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,359
Deformed?

285
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,899
Why didn't you say so?

286
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,902
{\an8}They should call this book
"Johnny Deformed".

"but not the thing

295
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,550
Wow.

296
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,676
Mm-hmm.
If you'd like to learn more

297
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,484
about colonial times, we could take
a field trip to Olde Springfield Towne.

298
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,019
(garage door opens)

299
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,732
(yelling)

300
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,610
D'oh!

301
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,397
(karate grunts)

302
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,536
(karate yell)

303
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,540
-LISA: Dad.
-Wha!

304
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,915
Dad!

305
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,631
Everyone likes Whacking Day,
but I hate it.

306
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,672
Is there something wrong
with me?

307
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,216
Yes, honey.

308
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,719
Then what should I do?

309
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,601
Just squeeze your rage
into a bitter little ball

310
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,258
and release it at
an appropriate time.

311
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,638
Like that day
I hit the referee

312
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,144
with a whiskey bottle.

313
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,346
-Remember that?
-Yeah.

314
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,185
When daddy hit
the referee?

315
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,230
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

316
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,362
Any experience?

317
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,525
Yes. I played
Panicky Idiot #2

318
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,494
in "The Poseidon Adventure".

319
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,584
Sorry, we're looking
for more of a "duh, duh" idiot.

320
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,582
But... No, I see.

321
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,035
-(Barney groaning)
-Hello, Barney.

322
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,915
Are you playing
the town drunk?

323
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,382
Actually, I'm supposed
to be the governor.

324
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,633
(belching)

325
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,344
The enemy
surrounded the fort,

326
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,804
and said that if
the captain was sent out,

327
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,675
the rest would be spared.

328
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,892
-What did they do?
-They sent him out.

329
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,523
-Was he killed?
-And how!

330
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,139
That's why they call it
Fort Sensible.

331
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:19,398
MAN: This is Jebediah Springfield
at the Battle of Ticonderoga.

332
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,363
Next.

333
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,702
And here he is
killing a snake

334
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,068
on the very first
Whacking Day in 1775.

335
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,736
Hey, wait a minute.

336
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,446
That was the same day
he was at Ticonderoga.

337
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,827
How could he be in
two places at once?

338
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,084
Uh... um...

339
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,076
you see...

340
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,844
He'll blow the whole deal.

341
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,722
Get him out of here.

342
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,548
Roger.

343
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,893
(gasping)

344
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,798
If you want to learn
more about Whacking Day,

345
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,007
there are many fine books
in our gift shop.

346
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,267
Welcome to your official
Whacking Day headquarters.

347
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,060
I've hidden a snake
somewhere in the store.

348
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,355
The first one to whack it
gets a free Squishee.

349
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,150
(grunting)
I got it.

350
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,653
No. That's a licorice whip.

351
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,355
MAN:
Over here near the beer.

352
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,155
-Hey, hey!
-Aah!

353
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,619
Oh, I should have put
more thought into my promotion.

354
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,080
Aim for the body, men.

355
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,200
Right, chief.

356
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,117
(gunshot)

357
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,079
And the Lord said

358
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,206
"Whack ye all the serpents
which crawl on their bellies

359
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,094
"and thy town shall be

360
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,551
a beacon unto others."

361
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,261
So you see, Lisa,
even God himself

362
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,144
endorses Whacking Day.

363
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,470
Let me see that.

364
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,925

And you too.

381
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,519
Snakes! Snakes everywhere!

382
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,607
Getting ready
for Whacking Day?

383
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,283
What's Whacking Day?

384
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,742
Did you bring
the pre-whacked snakes?

385
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,044
Beautiful.

386
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,376
Well, Marge,
should I whack slow or fast?

387
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,723
Slow, then fast.

388
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,090
(both giggling)

389
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,097
Uh-oh.

390
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,138
Dad, please,

391
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,021
for the last time,
I beg you,

392
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,138
don't lower yourself
to the level of the mob.

393
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,016
Lisa, maybe
if I'm part of that mob,

394
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,484
I can help steer it
in wise directions.

395
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,395
Now, where's my giant foam
cowboy hat and air horn?

396
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,280
(air horn blows)

397
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,576
And now to open
this year's festivities,

398
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,409
here's our Grand Marshall

399
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,164
the prophet of love,
Larry White.

400
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,617
Barry White.

401
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,167
No, it says here
Larry White.

402
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,670
I know my own name.

403
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,592
Yeah? Well, we'll see.

404
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,920
(crowd cheering)

405
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,336
Ladies and gentlemen,
my unlimited love to y'all.

406
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,846
It's truly an honor
to be here at this...

407
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,349
Hey, what is this
all about anyway?

408
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,982
(whispering)

409
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,519
Oh, God, no.

410
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,522
You people make me sick.

411
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,864
(cheering)

412
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,269
Were they even
listening to me?

413
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,067
I, uh, don't think so.

414
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:53,611
And now, let's hear it
for our own Miss Springfield.

415
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,527
Gentlemen,
start your whacking.

416
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,674
D'oh!

417
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,183
Eww! A bug!

418
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,183
(screams)

419
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,440
If the snakes
were in here,

420
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,861
we could protect them.

421
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,649
Well, according to this,

422
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,862
snakes hear by sensing
vibrations in the ground,

423
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,864
so if we put our
stereo speakers on the ground

424
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,567
and play something
with a lot of bass,

425
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,787
those snakes will be in here
like Oprah on a baked ham.

426
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,288
Oh, good idea. Let's see.

427
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,041
Bass, bass...

BART: People of Springfield,
Whacking Day is a sham!

459
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,593
It was started in 1924

460
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,636
as an excuse
to beat up the Irish.

461
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,850
(murmuring)

462
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,600
'Tis true.
I took many a lump,

463
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,431
but 'twas all in good fun.

464
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,676
Now wait a minute!

465
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,768
How can you people
turn on snakes

466
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,613
after all they've
done for you?

467
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,898
I'm an old man.

468
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,691
I hate everything

Snake did.

You like snakes,
don't you, Barry White?

473
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,620
I love the sexy slither
