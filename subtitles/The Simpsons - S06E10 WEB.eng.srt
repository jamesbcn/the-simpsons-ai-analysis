1
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:06,131
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,744
We now return to the 1971 film.

3
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,162
"Goodtime Slim,
Uncle Doobie

4
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,830
and the Great
Frisco Freak-out,"

5
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:39,913
starring Troy McClure.

6
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,338
Slim, if we've got the bag
with the stolen diamonds,

7
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,549
then what happened to
the bag with our stash?

8
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,260
There's more than
one way to get high, baby.

9
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,095
Whoa!

10
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,604
Please, Marge.

11
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,331
How often can I see
a movie of this caliber

12
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,523
on late-night TV?

13
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,317
Is there something
wrong, Homie?

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,640
No. It's just that I've only
seen this movie twice before

15
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,363
and I've seen you every night
for the last 11 ye...

16
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,115
What I meant to say is...

17
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,534
we'll snuggle tomorrow,
sweetie, I promise.

18
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,835
Enchiladas!

19
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,844
Mom! Dad!

20
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,013
Don't turn on the light!
Don't turn on the light!

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,723
There's a U.F.O.
outside my window.

22
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,266
Seriously.

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,935
Oh, Bart.

24
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,858
It's just an old golf
umbrella stuck in a tree.

25
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,857
C-Can I sleep in there
with you guys tonight?

26
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,150
No.

27
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,069
Can I sit on the roof
with a baseball bat

28
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,463
- in case the U.F.O. does come?
- Yes, yes, yes. That's fine.

29
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,988
Good, good.

30
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,494
I hope you kept
the Homie fires burning.

31
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,830
Homer!

32
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,666
- Homer, wake up. Wake up.
- What?

33
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,460
We need to talk about
the marital difficulties

34
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,420
we've been having lately.

35
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,339
Marge, there's just
too much pressure

36
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,050
what with my job,
the kids, traffic snarls,

37
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,677
political strife
at home and abroad.

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,139
But I promise you, the second
all those things go away,

39
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,516
we'll have sex.

40
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,226
I simply can't
wait that long.

41
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,686
Maybe we should
get some help.

42
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,895
How about a book?

43
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,898
- Ooh, okay.
- A tasteful book.

44
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,567
Oh, all right.

45
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,876
Hey, Marge, this guy
looks like Apu.

46
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,279
Shh. I don't want
people to see us

47
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,004
looking at
these books.

48
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,798
Hi, guys.
What you looking at?

49
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,635
Uh... I'm just reading up
on artillery.

50
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,596
Yes, and I'm pursuing
my interest in...

51
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,783
This one's a good choice,
and it's not too smutty.

52
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,602
It's a book on tape
by Paul Harvey.

53
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,770
You know that nice midwestern
man on the radio

54
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,414
who's like
a pleasant version of Grampa?

55
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,484
Ooh. "Mr. And
Mrs. Erotic American."

56
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,777
Mom, Dad.

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,381
Look! This biography
of Peter Ueberroth

58
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,572
is only 99 cents.

59
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,449
And I found
the new Al Gore book.

60
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,535
"Sane Planning,
Sensible Tomorrow."

61
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,388
Yeah, I hope it's as exciting
as his other book.

62
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,789
"Rational Thinking,
Reasonable Future."

63
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,333
I'm getting
this book on U.F.O.'s.

64
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,168
Did you know they're real?

65
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,811
But there's a huge
government conspiracy

66
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,004
to cover it up.

67
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,548
Oh, that's just
a paranoid fantasy.

68
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,778
Mr. Vice President

69
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,988
someone finally bought
a copy of your book, sir.

70
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,824
Well, this calls
for a celebration.

71
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,162
Celebrate good times,
come on

72
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,372
I will.

73
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,624
Let's celebrate...

74
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,126
Hello, Americans. Paul Harvey here.

75
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,837
Did you know every
good American

76
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,756
is at heart
an erotic American?

77
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,341
It's true.

78
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,260
A famous couple...

79
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,594
I don't need to tell you

80
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,846
it was Dwight and Mamie
Eisenhower...

81
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,723
Offered this advice:

82
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,102
"Double your pleasure
with a bath... together."

83
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,524
Homie, I can't quite...

84
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,695
The faucet's jammed
into my back.

85
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,405
I'm stuck.

86
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,864
So am I.

87
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,455
Kids?

88
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,833
Kids?

89
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,501
A romantic vacation

90
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,670
can provide titillation.

91
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,256
Sensual, sanitary seclusion
awaits you

92
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:02,093
at any of America's fine
AAA-approved motor lodges.

93
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,142
The Arabian Nights Room
looks nice.

94
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,268
The Pharaoh's Chamber

95
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,270
has a vibrating sarcophagus.

96
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,063
Sorry there, Fred and Ethel.

97
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,732
You should have made
a reservation.

98
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,234
We only got
one room left.

99
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,070
The toilet is overflowing
in the Caveman Room.

100
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,076
Oh, here we are.

101
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,662
The "utility room."

102
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,541
This isn't
very erotic.

103
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,376
I think it's an
actual utility room.

104
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,504
No, honey,
it's a romantic fantasy.

105
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,841
I imagine I'm the janitor,
and you're...

106
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,177
the janitor's wife

107
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,721
who has to live with me
in the utility room.

108
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,477
Don't mind me, folks.

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,354
Just need to get
the ol' wet-dry vac.

110
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,360
By now your new, improved love life

111
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,446
should have you flinging woo
like nobody's business.

112
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,532
So, to you,
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American

113
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,951
I bid... good day.

114
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,419
Welcome home, son.

115
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,897
I broke two lamps
and lost all your mail.

116
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,255
What's wrong
with your wife?

117
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,007
Never mind.
You wouldn't understand.

118
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,092
- Flu?
- No.

119
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,843
- Protein deficiency?
- No.

120
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,846
Pneumonoultramicroscopic
silicovolcanoconiosis?

121
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,847
No.

122
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,766
Unsatisfying
sex life?

123
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,520
Yes, but please,
don't you say that word.

124
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,106
What? Sex!

125
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,816
What's so unappealing

126
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,860
about hearing your elderly
father talk about sex?

127
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,154
I had sex.

128
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,703
You're home safe.
Done my duty.

129
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,181
See you the next time
we need your signature.

130
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,499
Aw, you never want
to spend any time with me.

131
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,544
But I can help you
with your loving problem.

132
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,129
I got a home remedy

133
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,006
that'll put the dowsers
back in your trousers.

134
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,595
Legend has it

135
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,265
my great Grampappy
stumbled upon this recipe

136
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,851
when he was trying to invent
a cheap substitute

137
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,102
for holy water.

138
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,983
Here you g...

139
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,109
Hey!

140
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,529
Here you go, you ingrate.

141
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:31,242
Think of me when you're having
the best sex of your life.

142
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,410
Drink it.

143
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,214
Kids, here's $50.
Why not go to the movies

144
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,008
then take a cab
to your aunt's house.

145
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,302
Stay there. Phone call you later.
Now now now.

146
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,970
Whoa! Homie, what's...

147
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,181
Marge, I'll explain
to you afterwards.

148
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,775
What do you think
Mom and Dad are doing right now?

149
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,859
I don't know.

150
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,121
Here he is.

151
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,498
Rex Harrison
and Paul Anka

152
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,624
rolled into one.

153
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,212
That tonic really works.

154
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,630
You and Grampa
should bottle it

155
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,256
and go into business
together.

156
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,967
You want me to spend
more time with Dad?

157
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,636
What about my
new year's resolution?

158
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,513
You can make a lot of money.

159
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,806
Yeah! Where are my pants?

160
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,909
You threw them
out the window

161
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,476
in a fit of passion.

162
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,912
You said you were never going
to need them again.

163
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,396
Oh, hurry, Neddie,
they're awful.

164
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,941
You just be ready
with that garbage bag.

165
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,320
Ooh, mama!

166
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,572
This is finally
really happening.

167
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,157
After years
of disappointment

168
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,909
with "get rich quick" schemes,

169
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,079
I know I'm gonna get rich
with this scheme... and quick.

170
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,834
Sir. Uh, hello, sir.

171
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,629
Yes. You look like a man
who needs help

172
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,922
satisfying his wife, so...

173
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,841
I guess people
have some sort

174
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,802
of moral objection
to our sex drug.

175
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,929
Let me sell it,
you idiot!

176
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,307
Step right up, folks

177
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,434
and witness the magnificent
medicinal miracle

178
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,855
of Simpson and Son's
patented Revitalizing Tonic!

179
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,233
Put some ardor in your
larder with our energizing

180
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,151
moisturizing, tantalizing,

181
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,488
romanticizing,
surprising her-prizing,

182
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,907
revitalizing tonic.

183
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,747
I doubt very highly

184
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,250
that one elixir could boast
so many fantastic properties.

185
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,504
What say we am-scray
out of here

186
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,924
and have a wild wing-ding
at the cyclotron, doctor?

187
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,844
Anything you say,
professor. Whoa!

188
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,807
Ah, tonight we'll push
the twin beds together.

189
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,392
And I found something
for Milhouse

190
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,893
down at the mall too.

191
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:03,894
A pup tent.

192
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,104
Oh, boy.

193
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,981
Now I can sleep out in the yard.

194
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,774
Yeah! Every single night.

195
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,487
I've discovered that
the rejuvenating effect

196
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,407
people feel is actually
a mild form of poisoning...

197
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,409
No doubt a result of
the unsanitary conditions

198
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,536
in Grampa Simpson's bathtub.

199
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,121
Nonetheless...

200
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,923
What's going on?

201
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,258
Where are all
the grown-ups?

202
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,718
Who cares?

203
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,304
With no adults around,
I run this city.

204
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,475
Uh... carry on.

205
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,685
Listen to this.

206
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,604
"Unexplainable behavior...

207
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,773
"individuals acting
in a secretive fashion

208
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,609
"are often involved
with U.F.O.'s

209
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,611
"or other paranormal phenomena,

210
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,905
e.g., telephone explosions."

211
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,450
Jeez, if it's in a book,
it's got to be true.

212
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,826
Scary, no?

213
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,370
And this guy's

214
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,788
head of the Spaceology
Department

215
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,540
at the Correspondence
College of Tampa!

216
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,292
Will you cook
my dinner for me?

217
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,044
My parents aren't around

218
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,421
and I'm not allowed
to turn on the stove.

219
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,633
Hurry up!

220
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,094
We got a lot of tonic to sell
and a lot of towns to visit.

221
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,555
Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom,
Lake Flaccid...

222
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,600
Great. I'm gonna be stuck
in a car all weekend

223
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,560
with that wheezy windbag.

224
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,355
...and that's what's wrong
with Bart's generation.

225
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,190
Now, as for your generation...

226
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,403
And for the minimal outlay
of one dollar

227
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,280
you can take home a bottle
of liquid lothario.

228
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,824
Distilled Don Juan.

229
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,034
Catalytically carbonated
Casanova.

230
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:46,080
Lock old Rover in the shed
'cause man has a new best friend

231
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,166
in Simpson and Son's
Revitalizing Tonic.

232
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,584
I'm not convinced!

233
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,586
I've had bad luck
with aphrodisiacs.

234
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,547
All questions will be answered.

235
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,215
All fears will be allayed

236
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,009
with one incontrovertible
demonstration.

237
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,846
May I have a volunteer
from the audience?

238
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,056
Yes... you sir!

239
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,016
Now, sir, you've never
seen me before

240
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,017
is that correct?

241
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,602
That is correct.

242
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,526
Well, than, how come his face
is on the bottle?

243
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,408
You're the worst
shill I've ever seen.

244
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,410
You're a disgrace to the
medicine show business.

245
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,828
They didn't
start chasing us

246
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,872
until you turned on
that getaway music.

247
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,933
Okay, it's now painfully clear.

248
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,686
The adults are definitely
paving the way

249
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,938
for an invasion
by the saucer people.

250
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,774
You fool! Can't you see

251
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,525
it's a massive
government conspiracy?

252
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,403
Or have they gotten to you too?

253
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,074
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it! Stop it!

254
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,786
Why are you guys jumping
to such ridiculous conclusions?

255
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,913
Haven't you ever heard of
"Ockham's razor"?

256
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,749
"The simplest explanation
is probably the correct one."

257
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,542
So what's the
simplest explanation?

258
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,919
I don't know.

259
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,504
Maybe they're
all reverse vampires

260
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,631
and they have
to get home before dark.

261
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,967
Reverse vampires!

262
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,348
Hey, wait a minute.

263
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,100
That's Amos Pierson's
moose farm.

264
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,227
Make a right here.

265
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,651
Ew... Why are we stopping
at this dump?

266
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,196
That's the house
you grew up in, son.

267
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,281
Wow!

268
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,992
Let's go find that
hot dog tree I planted.

269
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,869
Yeah, we lived here

270
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,205
till the bank
foreclosed in '63.

271
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,499
Farm went bust
after the cows

272
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,210
started giving
sour milk.

273
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,380
Something must have
spooked them good.

274
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,882
Nyah, stupid cows!

275
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,592
Na-na-na-na-na.

276
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,978
Oh, memories.

277
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,481
If this old place
could talk, it'd say...

278
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,158
There she is,

279
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,995
the old Radiation King.

280
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,913
You'd park yourself
right there

281
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,708
and watch for hours on end.

282
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,006
If I, uh, may, Helen,
I'd like to respond to that question

283
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,008
with yet another
flip remark.

284
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,594
Wow.

285
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,266
Look at me, er, Mom.

286
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,768
I am, er, President Kennedy.

287
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,437
Oh, Abe.
Maybe our Homer

288
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,273
could grow up to be
President someday.

289
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,858
You, President?

290
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,902
This is the greatest country
in the world.

291
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,946
We've got a whole system
set up to keep people like you

292
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,239
from ever becoming President.

293
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,450
Quit your daydreaming,
melonhead!

294
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,870
Quit your daydreaming,
melonhead!

295
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,371
Dad...

296
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,166
How come you never
gave me any encouragement?

297
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,668
Maybe I could have been
something more than I am.

298
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,421
Like a travel agent
to a great scientist

299
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,714
or the inventor

300
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,925
of a hilarious
refrigerator alarm.

301
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,468
Who are you to complain?

302
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,761
You lock me up in a home

303
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,638
and give me
the same damn

304
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,222
shower safety seat
every Christmas.

305
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,926
Your whole life
you never said

306
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,602
one nice thing to me.

307
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,771
That's 'cause
you're a screw-up.

308
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,439
You're the screw-up!

309
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,483
Why, you little...

310
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,652
All right.

311
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,735
All right. That's it.

312
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,154
We're going home.

313
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,822
I'm sick of you
and your stupid tonic.

314
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,784
If I hadn't taken that
stupid tonic 38 years ago

315
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,203
you'd have never been born
and I'd have been happy.

316
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,704
You were an accident!

317
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,458
Get out.

318
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,418
I'm sorry I said that.

319
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,670
Out.

320
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,713
I'm going to get
out of the car

321
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,924
and I hope you'll find it
in your heart

322
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,676
not to drive awa...

323
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,304
Well, I'll be all right

324
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,599
as long as I can remember
my Army training.

325
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,936
Dang!

326
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,278
I'm sorry.

327
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,412
Hi.

328
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,747
Homie, are you really going
to ignore Grampa

329
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,748
for the rest
of your life?

330
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,583
Of course not, Marge.

331
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,127
Just for the rest
of his life.

332
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,712
He said I was an accident.

333
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,838
He didn't want to have me.

334
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,589
You didn't want
to have Bart.

335
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,442
I know, but you're never
supposed to tell the child.

336
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,486
You tell Bart all the time.
You told him this morning.

337
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,303
But when I do it,
it's cute.

338
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,848
So finally
we're all in agreement

339
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,725
about what's going on
with the adults.

340
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,808
Milhouse.

341
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,645
Okay. Here's what we've got.

342
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,898
The Rand Corporation
in conjunction with

343
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,984
- the saucer people...
- Thank you.

344
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,320
Under the supervision
of the reverse vampires...

345
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,241
Are forcing our parents
to go to bed early

346
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,953
in a fiendish plot to
eliminate the meal of dinner!

347
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,415
We're through
the looking glass here, people.

348
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:25,252
Kids, your daddy and his daddy
are involved in a very sticky

349
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,964
nutty, chewy, chocolatey...
Put it away, boy...

350
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,674
Situation,

351
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,469
and your daddy has realized
something very important.

352
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,805
A father should always
make his kids feel wanted.

353
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,182
Starting right now, I promise

354
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,558
to spend a lot more time
with you

355
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,936
and give you the attention
you deserve.

356
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,521
I can't breathe.

357
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,610
And just feast your ears on
this tantalizing testimonial

358
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,320
from my own flesh and blood...

359
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,448
The son who puts the fun
in Simpson and Son,

360
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,950
my son, Barney!

361
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,120
I used to be a fat,
disgusting slob.

362
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,499
That medicine seems to be
giving your son

363
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,917
a lot of gas.

364
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,044
I assure you his
belching is the result

365
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,129
of an unrelated
alcohol problem.

366
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,806
It just ain't the same
without Homer.

367
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,183
He knew how to drive a car.

368
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,648
Son, my dear son.

369
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,025
From now on, I'm going to be
a good and attentive father.

370
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,109
And for starters,

371
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,611
your old man is gonna

372
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,488
to teach you how to ride

373
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,490
your very first bike.

374
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,456
Dad, number one,

375
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,791
I know how
to ride a bike.

376
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,835
Number two,
I already own a bike

377
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,295
and number three,
that is a girl's bike.

378
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,172
You're no girl.

379
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,632
You're a boy.

380
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,633
A good boy.

381
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,968
You can be President.

382
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,220
Scratch that.
You will be President!

383
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,303
Dad!

384
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,681
I think Lisa

385
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,975
needs another push
on her new tire swing.

386
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,228
No, Dad,
I want to get down.

387
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,521
This tire is filthy

388
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,857
and the steel belts
are poking me.

389
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,985
- Whee!
- No!

390
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,278
No offense, Homer

391
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,821
but your half-assed
underparenting

392
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,657
was a lot more fun than your
half-assed overparenting.

393
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,701
But I'm using my whole ass.

394
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,036
Dad, it's just that
too much of your love

395
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,496
can really be...

396
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,331
scary.

397
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,461
Someday you'll thank me
for all this scary love.

398
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,422
Now I've got
to go somewhere

399
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,465
and do some
serious thinking.

400
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,262
I'm sure he meant to say
serious drinking.

401
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,805
That's what I assumed.

402
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,228
Here's where it all
started to go wrong.

403
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,147
How am I supposed
to be a good Dad

404
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,773
when I never had one myself?

405
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,321
Oh, Dad wasn't even around
on Christmas morning

406
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,489
when I actually got
to meet Santa Claus.

407
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,283
Some father.

408
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,493
Wait a minute.

409
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,913
Dad?

410
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,208
Oh... this photo is a blessing.

411
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,168
It eases my pain.

412
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,180
This tonic's caused me
nothing but trouble.

413
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,058
You've done all the damage
you're gonna do.

414
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,102
Oh, nuts!

415
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,195
- Dad!
- Son!

416
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,529
I'm a screw-up.

417
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,573
I burned down our house.

418
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,158
No, I'm a screw-up.

419
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,369
I burned down our house.

420
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,579
- You know what?
- What?

421
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,248
We're both screw-ups.

422
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,083
It doesn't matter.

423
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,293
What matters is
you were right

424
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,003
when you told me

425
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,965
I never said anything
nice about you.

426
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,593
So... are you gonn say
something nice now?

427
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,345
Well, I hadn't thought
that far ahead.

428
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,474
Oh, okay, here it goes.

429
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:11,270
I'm not sorry
I had you, son,

430
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,023
and I was
always proud...

431
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,151
that you weren't
a short man.

432
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,653
Aw, Dad!

433
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,576
What do you say
we roll on the grass, son?

434
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,121
I'm with you, Dad.
