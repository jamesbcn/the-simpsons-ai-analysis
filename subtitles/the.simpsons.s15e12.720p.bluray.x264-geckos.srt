to wash, but l do.

plus that ticket
you got for panhandling.

353

But, Marge,
it was all for you,

354
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,038
to buy you all
the nice things you deserve.

355
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,917
The flowers, the earrings,
the Bob Seger boxed set,

356
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,212
which really only
needed to be one disk,
but the box was nice!

357

Homer, l don't need
fancy things.

358
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,466
And even if l did,
this is the wrong way
to get them.

359

And to remind you
of what you've done,

360
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,310
l'm gonna keep these
earrings and wear them at
social occasions.

to buy me a broach.

the code of the pictograph.

We were having a sleepover
and a robber came
and wet my bed.

Then he folded
the bed back into the couch

385
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,698
and disappeared
into the night.

386
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,451
l knew you'd blow it.
Now let me show
you that mound.

nothing's wrong, that means
