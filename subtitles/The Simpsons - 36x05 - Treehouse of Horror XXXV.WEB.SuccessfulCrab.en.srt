00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:37,704
You see...

365
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,599
Oh...

366
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,227
Do you not see
what Marge is doing?

367
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,954
She's trying
to break up a great team.

368
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,899
Look, Denim, we've had
some laughs, danced,

369
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,141
leg-strangled a guy,

370
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,569
and I could have never
gotten Marge without you.

371
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,055
There's no easy way to say this,
but maybe it's time

372
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:57,633
for me to fart in other pants.

373
00:17:57,652 --> 00:18:00,561
No, no, no.
Homer, don't break up with me.

374
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,063
No one will ever
flatter your ass like I do.

375
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:06,066
I'm gonna shut up this voice
in my head and in my pants

376
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:08,252
the only way I know how.

377
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:15,593
[snoring]

378
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:18,170
He's passed out.

379
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,723
This might be my only chance.

380
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:26,604
I got you a little surprise.

381
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:28,013
Aah! Khakis?

382
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,440
Where are my jeans?

383
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,925
Where they belong:
in the washing machine.

384
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,945
And I really love how you look

385
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,188
in these sexy, beige, dad pants.

386
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,616
You don't know what you've done!

387
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:40,843
[Denim shouting]

388
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,620
Never wash

389
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,605
quality Denim!

390
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,606
[gasps]

391
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,941
Aah!
These Dockers meant nothing.

392
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,276
They came on to me.

393
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,853
What the hell's happening?

394
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:52,964
Homer is my host, not yours.

395
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:54,948
And you're about to die!

396
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:55,967
[both gasp]

397

-[exclaiming]

398
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:01,864
-[grunting]
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

399
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:03,432
Stop that!

400
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:05,977
Aah! Acid.

401
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:09,313
So painfully '80s.

402
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,207
Run, Marge, run!

403
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:13,359
Run from my pants!

404
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,196
-Aah!
-Aah!

405
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,386
[Denim]
Stitching stretched.

406
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:24,996
Rivets popping.

407
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,314
Ech! So hairy.

408
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:30,559
Like being on a sweaty cactus.

409
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:33,337
-Aah!
-These aren't my moves, man.

410
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:34,914
Not my moves.

411
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,340
[exclaiming]

412
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,509
[grunting]

413
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:43,572
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

414
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,308
[whimpers]

415
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:48,603
-Aah! [grunting]
-[growling]

416
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,340
Stop!
I'm never gonna

417
00:19:53,434 --> 00:19:56,435
let anything
come between us again.

418
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:59,922
These past weeks have been
the best of my life.

419
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:02,091
I can't live without you.

420
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:03,350
Oh, Homie.

421
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,494
I love you, too.

422
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,263
Uh, yeah.

423
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:08,873
I wasn't talking to you.

424
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,874
Yes!

425
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:12,025
Thank you, Jeansus.

426
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,103
Deep down,

427
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,881
I knew it all along.
[sniffles]

428
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,216
Really?

429
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,460
Have you stopped following
her on Facebook?

430
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:23,312
Yes.

431
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:25,389
-No.
-Thank you for being honest.

432
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:27,950
It was nice of you
to let her live.

433
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:31,044
Well, my species will need
as many hosts as possible.

434
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,713
Wait, what?
