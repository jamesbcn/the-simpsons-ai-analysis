<i>This is so boring!</i>

348
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,526
(HAMMER CLICKS)

349
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,689
<i>Shh!</i>

350
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,153
(LAUGHS)

351
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,360
Hey, Mom, can we have
fried chicken for dinner?

352
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,323
BOTH: Lisa!

353
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,618
BOTH: Lisa!

354
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,909
Don't worry,
we're not evil spirits!

355
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,119
Although,
if we were evil spirits,

356
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,500
we'd probably assume
the shape of your parents.

357
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,581
Homer!

358
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,166
Marge, we owe her the truth.

359
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,805
(SCREAMING)

360
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,929
There, there, dear.

361
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,772
Grandma will protect you.

362
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,271
But I ain't grandma!

363
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,605
(SCREAMING)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

364
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,566
(GASPS)

365
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,035
Lisa, meet your new husband.

366
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:33,988
(CHUCKLES)

367
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,199
I made us a dream
house out of slime!

368
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,585
I don't know
howl reproduce,

369
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,083
but we'll have a great
time figuring it out.

370
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,457
(SCREAMING)
(SHATTERS)

371
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,084
(GROANS)

372
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:48,919
Where am I?

373
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,884
(ROARING)

374
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,383
(SCREAMING)

375
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,730
Welcome to the land
of wild beasts, little girl.

376
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,856
(ROARING)

377
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,986
Not scared. Not scared.

378
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,403
For God's sake, girl,
you're eight years old.

379
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,572
It's natural for you
to feel scared sometime.

380
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,071
But I'm too smart
to get scared.

381
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,114
Lisa, everybody
gets scared

382
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,951
no matter how old
or how smart they are.

383
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,119
In fact, I'm scared of her.

384
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,706
No, you're afraid
of intimacy.

385
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,834
That's because I know after
we mate, you'll eat me.

386
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,965
Your brother
didn't seem to mind.

387
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,550
You know, you
monsters seem scary,

388
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,849
but when you get
a little closer...

389
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,850
(LAUGHS) You're just funny.

390
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,394
(ALL MUMBLING)

391
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,813
But wait. How am
I supposed to sleep

392
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,270
with that spooky cemetery
outside my window'?

393
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,402
You could just draw the
blinds, you silly goose.

394
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,653
Or get a night-light.

395
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,864
My dad says
they're too expensive.

396
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,286
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

397
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,329
For God's sake,
they're four bucks apiece.

398
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,782
I could slime your dad,

399
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,959
just like I slimed
us a Paris honeymoon.

400
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,168
I think I'll be
okay by myself.

401
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,923
What is it about slime
that chicks don't dig?

402
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,303
Bye, guys. You've really
helped me a lot.

403
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,179
Bye-bye, Lisa.
Bye, Lisa!

404
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,806
See you soon!
See you soon!

405
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,473
We're always just
a concussion away!

406
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,226
Lisa, honey,
please wake up.

407
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,108
If you do, I'll get you a new pony.
New pony?

408
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,732
This is still part
of your dream.

409
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,409
Dreaming... Dreaming...

410
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,610
Now you're awake.

411
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,737
Oh!

412
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,956
Sweetie, we're going
to get you home

413
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,409
and straighten out all
these fears you have.

414
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,879
I think I'm going to be fine.
Let's get some breakfast.

415
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,586
Chief, it's light out.

416
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,171
You can open your eyes
and come down.

417
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,426
I don't want to, Lou!

418
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,507
I've got
a pizza bagel for you.

419
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:03,926
Let's roll.
