73
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,376
{\an8}if we don't watch movies
about torture in crawl spaces,

74
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,217
{\an8}how will we know what to do

75
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,932
{\an8}if someone puts us
in a torture crawl space?

76
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,063
{\an8}Not if, when.

77
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,890
{\an8}Nah, I'm gonna go see one
of those Jennifer Aniston movies

78

Oh, that is cool.

That's what I was going for.

128

you're pretty sharp.

129

I'm actually in fourth grade,

130

the day before I have
to clean the crawl space?

135
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,433
Come on, boy!
We've got to go home!

136
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,848

We're going to a seminar:

"Extracting Lunch Money
from a Cashless Society."

146
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,831
We're gonna rob the guy
giving the seminar.

147
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,287
Bart and I'll figure out
something.

148
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,248

151
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,842
Ah.

152
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,005
Doesn't get
any better than this.

153
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,927
Huh? That's weird,
my armpits are getting wet!

154
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,226
Wow, the TV's hooked
up to the Internet.

155
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,690
You can stream whole
seasons of old TV shows.

156
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,942
Hmm.

157
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,153
Seen it. Seen it. Seen it.

158
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,783
British version was better.

159
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,940
Totally scripted. Sued it.

160
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,487
<i>Stranded?</i>
What's that?

161
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,451
<i>Stranded</i> was a show
about people marooned

162
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,581
on a mysterious island
that's riddled with

163
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,788
religious and scientific paradoxes.

164
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,999
It was huge.

165
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,078
Well, the first season
and the last season.

166
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,134
Well,
islands are always entertaining,

167
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,748
from Gilligan to Iwo Jima.

168

A plane crash!

171
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,467
Wait a minute.

172
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,523
That flashback raised
more questions than it answered.

173
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,429
(grunting)

174
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,015
Oh, my God.

175
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,353

176
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,608
my pet cat
from when I was little.

177
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,491
And on his name tag

178
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,148
is the number of our flight!

179
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,736
Purr-gatory.

180
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,491
Where are we?!

181
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,079
What a great opening episode!

182
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,082
And I'm sure everything they
said will pay off handsomely!

183
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,666
(dramatic music playing)

184
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,257
Hmm. Ah!

185
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,763
Huh?

186
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,467
Let's go.
And don't look guilty.

187
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,387
(alarm beeping)

188
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,727
Young lady,
I need to check your purse.

189
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,152
I didn't steal nothing.

190
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,481
If anything happens to her,

191
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,816
I'll beat you up
from inside your brain.

192
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,363
(grunts)

193
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,124
I stole this.

194
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,529
You stole perfume?

195
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,947
Uh, yeah, me.

196
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,995
I use it all the time.

197
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,119
<i>♪ Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi ♪</i>

198
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,456
<i>♪ You-you-you-you ♪</i>

199
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,251
and I are taking
a trip to mall jail.

200
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,795
Isn't that what used to be
the Beanie Baby store?

201
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,049
Shut up.

202
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,966
(explosion)

203
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,052
This is so cool.

204
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,387
You took a fall for me.

205
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,062
No one's done anything
for me before.

206
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,230
Uh-oh.

207
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,888
Don't worry.
I made sure he can't get too far.

208
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,268
-(tire pops, hisses)
-I'd use my legs

209
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,364
but I've forgotten how!

210
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,818
Come with me.

211
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,608
Hey, the first time we lost Maggie
was in this store!

212
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,195
Bart,
here's my thank-you gift.

213
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,951
What could a girl have
that I...

214
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,743
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

215
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,407
<i>It's just like Dad's!</i>

216
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,054
Bart, you haven't touched
your mashed potatoes.

217
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,626
More breast?

218
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,088
What-- No!

219
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,967
I'm offering you
a chicken breast, you boob!

220
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,765
Doesn't anyone here realize
I'm only ten years old?

221
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,310
Bart,
no dinner means no dessert.

222
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,654
(gasps)

223
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,519
I'm just not ready
for cookies!

224
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,766
You know, I should
get back to the treadmill.

225
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,238
(chuckles)

226
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,204
He exercises so much,
but he looks the same.

227
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,121
I guess the weight
will all come off at once,

228
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,449
some day in the future.

229
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,584
Don't you believe
anything Homer says.

230
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,962
His first word was a lie.

231
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,420
Who did this?

232
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,290
-Mommy.
-She did?!

233
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,957
Then I'm gonna
withhold affection

234
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,206
without telling her why.

235
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,679
(dramatic music playing)

236
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,349
(groans)
Huh?

237
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,114
<i>Don't believe anything you were</i>
<i>told by me in the past,</i>

238
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,070
because that was not me.
But this is me now.

239
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,030
But in less than a second,
I'll be gone forever.

240
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,030
(roaring)

241
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,361
I might be back!

242
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,793
(gasps)
The lava being!

243
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,828
That's why they showed a clip
of it on "previously on."

244
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,294
MARGE:
Homer!

245
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,584
You're using your
expensive new treadmill

246
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,128
just to watch a show that went
off the air five years ago?

247
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,423
And when I wanted
to watch it with you then,

248
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,337
you said it was
pretentious and repetitive.

249
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,386
Marge, there're so many
mysteries I need to have solved.

250
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:24,021
Now, if the Korean couple
can't speak English,

251
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,020
why were they doing
a crossword puzzle

252
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,862
where the answer to 23 down was
"enigma" spelled backwards?

253
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,479
What does it mean?

254
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,235
It means use the treadmill
for running or take it back!

255
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,739
And where will I watch TV?

256
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,411
On the TV!

257
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,159
And where will I walk?!

258
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,741
On the ground!

259
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,656
-And where...
-This is the stupidest fight ever!

260
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,745
We've had stupider!

261
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,211
I don't think so.

262
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,460
(slurps)

263
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,382
JIMBO:
Hey, Fart-tholomew.

264
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,010
You did a sweet job
watching my woman yesterday.

265
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,929
(both moaning)

266
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,888
So, what do you
want to do now?

267
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,509
What any boy would: push you in
a puddle and run away.

268
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,716
Maybe I should be
faithful to Jimbo.

269
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,517
He's bought me a lot of gum
over the past couple months.

270
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,351
Listen...

271
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,147
I could get wedgied for this,
but Jimbo's a jerk.

272
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,521
You can do better.

273
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,987
Wow. You told me
what's best for me...

274
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,988
at risk to yourself.

275
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,950
-Come with me.
-(gulps)

276
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,530
Shauna,
I forgot to grope you good-bye.

277
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,246
(both moaning)

278
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,996
At last!
This episode promises

279
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,045
to finally answer
one question.

280
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,339
Whoo-ho-ho-ho...

281
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,842
-MARGE: Homie!
-(shouts)

282
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,013
The kids are away
and Maggie's napping...

283
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,014
Ooh, that's great.

284
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,016
Can it wait another
104 hours?

285
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,518
-MARGE: Oh!
-(slams door)

286
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,930
She walked away

287
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,188
and slammed the door.
What does it mean?

288
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,690
What does it mean?!

289
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,482
MARGE:
It means I'm mad!

290
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,975
Oh, that's such
a first-take answer!

291

a wool hat to a pool?

It's not fair!
You know that's hilarious!

No horseplay
in the pool area.

312
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,686
This isn't play;
this is some serious payback.

313
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,645
Well, that's, um...

314
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,855
All right, you may
have found a loophole.

315
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,616
All right, I better check.
Hello, Abby?

316
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,949
I'm not calling about
the shift change! God!

317
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,195
But, well, since
you bring it up,

318
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,407
if there's a way to flip
Saturday with next Wednesday...

319
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,247
Simpson, prepare to...

320
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,004
Hey, no running on the deck!

321
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,416
I'm on the grass apron!

322
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,966
Huh? Ugh, everyone's
a swimming pool lawyer.

323
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,004
Oh, thank God.
Mom will pound them.

324
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,329
Why, if it isn't Jimbo,
Dorf and Ernie.

325
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,576
(all laugh)

326
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,167
Dorf.

327
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,422
Bart's not home yet,
but I'm always looking

328
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,764
to encourage non-Milhouse
play dates.

329
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,930
Stick around!

330
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:26,928
Oh...

331
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,259
Hey, Bart.

332
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,264
Oh, it's you.
(moaning)

333
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,676
Why do men always think
with their tongue?

334
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,265
I came to help you.

335
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,520
Then go back to Jimbo and show
him every boob you've got.

336
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,943
But you told me he was a jerk
and that I could do better.

337
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,572
(groans)

338
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,573
All right. Follow me
to a place where nerds,

339
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,446
dorks and dweebs can
gather in safety.

340
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:54,332
This isn't, like, some creepy
place under an off-ramp?

341
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,371
Okay,
we'll go to my second choice.

342
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,079
Now you be careful
with Bart's undies.

343
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,537
We will, Mrs. Simpson.

344
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,966
Think of this as your
personal Asgard,

345
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,298
and I, the all-seeing Heimdall,
guardian of the gate.

346
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,585
All-seeing?

347
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,138
Yeah, when's the last time
you saw your feet?

348
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,852
Oh, that's it!

349
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,732
Fellow bullies, I've got them!

350
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,229
We'll be right there.

351
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,651
You're a bully?

352
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,809
A cyber bully.

353
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,477
Anything I do,
it is important that

354
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,935
I can lie down while doing it.

355
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,395
-(phone chimes)
-Huh?

356
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,985
You just got yourself
in a flame war...

357
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,411
with a teenage girl.

358
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,330
Oh, flame on!

359
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,714
Oh! Oh!

360
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,464
You have cloven me from my
ponytail to my slipper shoe!

361
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,968
(sobs)
Get out!

362
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,339
And never return!

363
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,256
Oh, unless you want
to buy old Archie comics.

364
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,144
20 pound bricks
are a dollar.

365
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,564
Thank you all for coming
to my <i>Stranded</i> discussion group.

366
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,904
Hey, I loved that show.

367
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,939
Wasn't it awesome when
Colonel Darkwater...

368
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,403
-(horn blares)
-Spoiler alert!

369
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,192
I've only seen
up to season three,

370
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,896
episode 17:
"Coconut Cream Die."

371
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,567
So you don't know that season five
was a complete wank?

372
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,907
-(blaring)
-Spoiler!

373
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,622
Homer, calm down.

374
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,082
It's not like any of this stuff
really took place.

375
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,753
(blaring)

376
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,331
Spoiler!

377
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,956
Homer, for God sakes,

378
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,383
I'm trying to put
Maggie to sleep.

379
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,552
(baby talk)
I'm sorry, sweetie.

380
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,260
It's a Strandie
discussion group.

381
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,471
Yes, it is!

382
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,051
We discuss why airplane
go crash-crash

383
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,057
but people don't die-die.

384
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,349
You wanna know what happens
on your stupid show?

385
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,273
Firstly, the "mysterious island"

386
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,601
is 15 miles from Long Beach.

387
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,767
Also, Doorway Three led to Hell

388
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,356
despite the series creators'
repeated insistence

389
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,532
it did not lead to Hell,
and the entire Strandiverse,

390
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,872
is a piece of gravel
in a cosmic kitty litter box!

391
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,198
(gasps)
Thanks, Marge.

392
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,704
You ruined my show.

393
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,537
Now,
I'm going to give you a spoiler

394
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,503
about our marriage:
it's not great right now.

395
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,165
(gasping)

396
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,053
Well, since this
is a discussion group,

397
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,470
let's discuss.

398
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,008
I think they're having a spat.

399
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,722
I'd say it's more of a tiff.

400
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,052
Oh, so I'm a moron, am I?

401
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,056
Fellas, fellas,
I know where this is going.

402
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,178
Give me
all your weapons now.

403
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,347
(grunts)

404
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,935
Now it's time to talk about
what Carl wants.

405
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,583
Oh, man, they have every
entrance covered.

406
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,121
You'd have to be
a Navy SEAL to get in or out.

407
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,665
LISA:
Hello, lovebirds.

408
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,868
Whoa!

409
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,378
What are you doing here?

410
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,379
I've been following your storyline
from afar, Bart,

411
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,842
waiting for that inevitable point

412
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,052
where you get into trouble
you couldn't get out of.

413
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,303
Perhaps I could
broker a settlement.

414
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,295
Well, that's my boyfriend,
but he's a wad.

415
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,097
And your brother's
not a wad-- he's a dink

416
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,850
on the road to doofus.

417
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,352
Hear, hear.

418
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,523
Ow.

419
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,941
The lamb has returned
to the slaughter.

420
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,731
Whoa, you should
write that down, man.

421
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,015
I'll remember it.

422
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,862
I don't think Shauna
should choose any of you.

423
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,195
Shauna should choose Shauna.

424
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,321
Your older sister's right, Bart.

425
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,868
You don't want me?

426
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,001
I want to find out who I am.

427
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,868
And that's something only

428
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,915
an inappropriately
older man can tell me.

429
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,669
Well, that is one
lucky creepy guy.

430
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,842
MARGE: Lisa, are you
out there in your slippers?

431
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,671
Come inside!

432
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,126
Well, Bart, I guess
that's our cue to skedaddle...

433
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,087
Not so fast, Simpson...

434
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,348
Uh, what was that thing
I was gonna do to him?

435
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,890
Told you you should've
written it down.

436
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,233
If I wrote down everything
you told me to write down,

437
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,400
I'd have no time for punching.

438
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,558
Whoa, you should
write that down, man.

439
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,436
Lousy Marge...

440
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,986
ruining the delicate
relationship

441
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,070
between a man and his TV show.

442
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,076
I'd tell my best friend,
but that's Marge too.

443
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,660
MARGE:
Homie, come in the bedroom.

444
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,250
(gasps)

445
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:13,092
Care to join me in a private
last episode party?

446
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,260
Well...

447
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,589
It's okay, Dad.

448
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,553
He's just putting
the fear of God in me.

449
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,344
Okay, but if this house
starts a-rockin',

450
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,097
don't come a-knockin'.

451
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,099
Have a wonderful evening, sir.

452
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,774
(moaning, smooching)

453
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:46,247
-Purr-plexing, isn't it?
-HOMER: D'oh!

454
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,746
Shh!

455
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,968
