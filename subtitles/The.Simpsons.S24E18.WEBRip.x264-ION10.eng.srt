D'oh!

00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,240
{\an8}Our poor couch.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,950
{\an8}It sure has taken
a beating over the years.

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,952
{\an8}Might be time to get a new one.

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,954
{\an8}Really?
You want to throw something out

10
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,996
{\an8}just because it's a little old?

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,369
{\an8}Hello, everybody.

12
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,666

{\an8}(humming)

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,712
{\an8}Ow!

15
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,343
{\an8}Are there any two words

16
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,005
{\an8}more exciting than "couch shopping"?

17
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,014
{\an8}No need. I already went online

18
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,266
{\an8}and ordered a new couch
just like the old one.

19
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,638
{\an8}And, you know, Marge,
those salespeople

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,596
{\an8}weren't really our friends.

21
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,516
{\an8}But they let me take fabric samples.

22
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,436
{\an8}They charged a deposit.

23
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,244
{\an8}They had to. It came from corporate.

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,949
{\an8}That's right, sweetie,
it always comes from corporate.

25
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,001
{\an8}Hey, this one's going to Springfield.

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,869
{\an8}Chumps. Don't everyone know
that all New York furniture

27
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,036
{\an8}is full of bedbugs?

28
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,924
{\an8}Forget about it!

29
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,461
{\an8}It's forgot abouten!

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,803
{\an8}Mm-hmm!

31
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,261
{\an8}-(impressed murmuring)
-Ooh, wow.

32
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,045
{\an8}(sniffs) Mmm.

33
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,175
{\an8}New cushion smell.

34
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,772
{\an8}I'm gonna put all
my stuffed animals on it.

35
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,638
{\an8}(humming) All right, get comfy.

36
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,897
{\an8}Gentlemen, the fort is complete
and will stand forever.

37
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,736
{\an8}No way the Nazis will get in here.

38
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,583
{\an8}Oh, I thought we were the Nazis.

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,640
<i>The latest New York fashion</i>
<i>has come to Springfield: bedbugs.</i>

40
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,982
{\an8}Ew, just hearing about them makes me itch.

41
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,309
{\an8}Ooh, ooh. Funny how
the brain does that, huh?

42
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,606
{\an8}It's making me see them.

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,480
{\an8}(laughs) The brain is so stupid.

44
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,778
{\an8}(screams) Those are bedbugs!

45
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,123
{\an8}How did we get bedbugs?

46
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,778
{\an8}Probably one of Bart's dirty friends.

47
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,947
{\an8}Boy, why are your friends so dirty?

48
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,365
{\an8}Don't know.
Why are your friends such drunks?

49
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,174
{\an8}Touché.

50
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,422
{\an8}I know this seems bad,
but nothing brings out

51
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,053
{\an8}the best in Springfield like a crisis.

52
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,131

{\an8}Hold my hand.

{\an8}(groans)

59
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,954
{\an8}Ahem, people, there is no need to worry.

60
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,832
{\an8}I have developed
the perfect bedbug repellant.

00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:30,077
{\an8}You see, behold the power
of modified bear pheromones.

63
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,538
{\an8}(groaning) Ahh, no!

64
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,883
{\an8}Marge, Milhouse was clean as a whistle

65
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,756
{\an8}till he played with your boy.

66
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,013
{\an8}Now, we don't know it was the Simpsons.

67
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:45,095
{\an8}I think the most obvious
culprit is the poorest family.

68
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,943
'Tweren't us. We don't even have beds.

69
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,269
We sleep in washtubs and coffins.

70
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,855
Why won't somebody blame the children?

71
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,981
Well, the good news
is it forced us all to church.

72
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,818
You know, in the Middle Ages,

73
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,113
people took refuge in church
to escape the bubonic plague,

74
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,658
but that made the plague
spread even faster.

75
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,042
Church!

76
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,038
(indistinct arguing)

77
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,620
Everyone, please, calm down.

78
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,327
Reverend Lovejoy is here.

79
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,127
He will give us succor.

80
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,711
(clears throat)

81
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,930
The Epistle of Jeremy is often cited

82
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,388
as the most difficult book
of the Apocrypha.

83
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,890
But to me, none of the anagignoskomena

84
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,694
are more contemplative
than the book of Tobit.

85
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,018
(all shouting)

86
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,564
(shouting stops)

87
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,817
(crowd gasps)

88
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,478
Mind if I p-p-pray through?

89
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,987
It's the parson.

90
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,610
Are you gonna let
a sunny summer day be ruined

91
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,828
by a few b-b-bugs?

92
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:47,078
God's soldier in cardigan.

93
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,711
Looks like I picked a swell day
to return your six iron, Reverend.

94
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,790
Now, looky here, Tim.
This is a five-alarm brouhaha.

95
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,667
Now, for chili, that's just dandy,

96
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,974
but I brought you a little backup.

97
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,298
(clears throat)

98
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,893
(chuckles) I think I'm more
than capable of handling this.

99
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,600
Need I remind you
of the bingo riot last summer?

100
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,812
God called all their numbers that day.

101
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,103
Please meet your new associate minister,

102
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,517
the Right Reverend Elijah Hooper.

103
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,976
He was the number two man
from Shelbyville.

104
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,987
Introduced angle parking.

105
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,319
We got in six more cars.

106
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,405
Folks, isn't he something?

107
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,120
Big hand for Reverend Lovejoy.

108
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,330
Mm-hmm.

109
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,501
Everyone says great things about you, Tim,
and I can see why.

110
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,251
The posture, the haircut, the tiny feet.

111
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,004
It's amazing they hold you up.
But they do.

112
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,006
(chuckles) They do.

113
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,009
So charming.

114
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,221
It's like he's selling
silver polish at the state fair.

115
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,473
Look, here's why I'm here.

116
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,774
Church should make you happy,
like a warm mug of soup.

117
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,479
Why does it taste better from a mug?
I don't know, but it does.

118
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,401
God help me, I'm paying attention.

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,070
Okay, who here has read Leviticus?

120
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,068
Mmm!

121
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,399
Okay, now, who here
has seen <i>Meet the Parents?</i>

122
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,657
Me! Me, me. Me, me, me, me.

123
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,240
Hilarious film;
showed a whole new side of De Niro.

124
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,196
At first,
he couldn't stand his son-in-law,

125
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,036
-but then they patch things up...
-(snoring)

126
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,081
...in a comical fashion, remember?

127
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,584
The point is, at the end of the day,

128
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,206
we love each other.

129
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,173
And that's all this thing really says.

130
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,464
(murmuring)

131
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,587
So, don't waste your whole
Sunday listening to us.

132
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,474
Go home and watch one
of the <i>Die Hard</i> movies on TV.

133
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,562
They're always on,
and they're always good.

134
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,929
And, ladies, drop in
on a neighbor's open house

135
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,306
just to see what they did
with their sun room.

136
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,643
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

137
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,267
Now, go on home.

138
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,824
We're here every Sunday,
just like Snoopy in color.

139
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,939
ALL: Aw.

140
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,276
Can you believe this guy, Helen?
Hey... Helen?

141
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,743
-Tim.
-Yes, Helen?

142
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,284
My wedding ring is creating a glare.

143
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,948
Can you hold it?

144
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:56,036
This is the worst 17th Sunday
in Ordinary Time ever.

145
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,263
OTTO: One day out of rehab, and I...

146
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,390
Ooh... (laughs)

147
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,296
Whoa. (laughs)

148
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:14,058
(sniffs) Mmm,
debugged and fresh as a daisy.

149
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,152
Cool. They give you a bag
of the bedbugs they killed.

150
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,478
(laughs)

151
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,693
Homer's oatmeal, meet your raisins.

152
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,239
Homer's Pie Man costume, Lisa's red dress,

153
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,571
Lisa's red dress, Lisa's red dress,

154
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,447
Sunday Best Bart...

155
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,494
(gasps) Where is it?

156
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,578
My wedding dress!

157
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,666
Vodka? Is this Krusty's?

158
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,340
A high-voltage monkey prod?

159
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,210
(gasps) It is Krusty's.
He must have my dress.

160
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,338
-Let's go.
-What's the hurry?

161
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,715
I don't want a comedian
knowing my dress size.

162
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,513
(humming)

163
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,677
(gulps)

164
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,435
Wait a minute! This has oats in it!

165
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,058
Ooh, a nose hair trimmer.

166
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,345
(screams)

167
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,282
Yeah, I found a wedding dress
in my dry cleaning.

168
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,358
We used it in a sketch.

169
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,701
Where's my mail-order bride?

170
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,370
Ugh, how long was he in there?

171
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,833
Don't worry, we cleaned up
the crate real good.

172
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,674
What about my dress?

173
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,499
Oh, gee, I'm afraid
that dress is long gone.

174
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,375
I threw it out the window
during my post-show hissy fit.

175
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,721
{\an8}Some of us don't have dressing rooms.

176
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,220
-CARL: Wooden!
-LENNY: Plastic.

177
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,802
-Wooden.
-Plastic.

178
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,887
Why do we always argue
over coffee stirrers?

179
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,682
You know what's really stirring?

180
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,226
Live, local theater.

181
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,979
-(all laughing)
-Yeah.

182
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,651
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
before I let a Holy Joe

183
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,900
walk in this bar, I got to know

184
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,242
which of the two
true faiths you represent.

185
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,318
Well, I represent an easygoing
offshoot of Protestantism.

186
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,074
That is the wrong thing
to say to a snake handler.

187
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,577
Easy, Moe, easy.

188
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,949
Ah, this thing's
just loaded with rock salt.

189
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,616
I use it to keep the raccoons
out of my fridge.

190
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,325
And, of course, to coat the rims
of my margarita glasses.

191
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,551
Uh, Padre, can I be honest with you?

192
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,592
I've sucked every church
book ribbon there is

193
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,967
hoping to find one made of cherry.

194
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,564
But there isn't.

195
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,349
And if it's such a "good book,"

196
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,563
how come there's no blurbs on the back?

197
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,904
Not even David Sedaris.

198
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,729
And he'll flack anything.

199
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,694
Seriously, "pews"?

200
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,324
Homer, I love your passion.

201
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,241
It's terrific. It's really something.

202
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,029
Listen, I'm just thinking.

203
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,073
Would you consider being my deacon?

204
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,366
Deacon? Is that like one of those

205
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,830
weird Catholic priest things?

206
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,160
No, not at all.
It's like a sexton or a rector.

207
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,747
Oh, now we're talking. But why me?

208
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,793
Because, if I can get the man
who sleeps through church

209
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,127
to be my guy, this town will know

210
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,553
that religion can be fun.

211
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:55,392
Well, I'm not one
for taking new jobs on a whim.

212
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,809
But, as we say in the snow plow business,

213
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,678
I'm your astronaut.

214
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,560
<i>What do you think?</i>

215
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,805
<i>I didn't think Shotgun Mike's Bridal Store</i>

216
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,687
<i>had a nice dress, but you found it.</i>

217
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,025
<i>Homer, you're not supposed</i>
<i>to see the dress</i>

218
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,781
<i>before the wedding.</i>

219
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,783
<i>-Just looking for the bathroom.</i>
<i>-(woman screams)</i>

220
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,775
<i>This is not the bathroom!</i>

221
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,657
<i>Aw, but this paper towel feels so good.</i>

222
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,075
I'm sorry your dress is gone, Mom.

223
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,374
Oh, sweetie, it's not for me.

224
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,248
I wanted you to wear
that dress at your wedding.

225
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,166
Well, then, you shouldn't feel bad,

226
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,174
because I can't imagine myself
ever getting married.

227
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,257
(gasps)

228
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,012
Homer, your daughter
doesn't want to get married.

229
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,055
That would save us several hundred bucks.

230
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,429
Tell her she's wrong!

231
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,016
Right. Uh, I don't understand, Lisa.

232
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,862
We let you get up early
to watch the Royal Wedding.

233
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,818
Hey, I have a weakness for pomp.

234
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,029
Since when?

235
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,899
So, you see, what Jesus is saying

236
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,817
really can be explained

237
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,616
by an episode of <i>Californication.</i>

238
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,949
ALL: Oh.

239
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,615
Now Reverend Lovejoy will lead us in song.

240
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,714
<i>♪ God lifts you up where you be... ♪</i>

241
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,881
(sighs)

242
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,878
<i>♪ God lifts you up where... ♪</i>

243
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,761
(sighs)

244
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,628
<i>♪ God lifts you up... ♪</i>

245
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,295
Um... give me a minute.

246
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,465
Uh, but first, let me introduce
our new deacon-- Homer Simpson!

247
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,854
It's an honor, sir.

248
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,812
(applause)

249
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,982
Homer Simpson a deacon? But why?

250
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,651
You bring in the lost sheep,
and the others will follow.

251
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,820
Lost sheep. Yes! Sis boom bah!

252
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,569
(chuckling)

253
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,741
I don't think there's a place
for me here anymore.

254
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,571
Heading for the door, pushing the handle.

255
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,535
Left foot across the threshold.

256
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,159
Now the right.

257
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,077
Walking to car.

258
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,915
Stepped in hole.

259
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,880
Twisted ankle.

260
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,711
Tremendous pain.

261
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,006
Keep it elevated.

262
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,892
Church bulletin? Church bulletin?

263
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,601
Find out in whose loving memory
this week's service is.

264
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,682
The answer may shock you.

265
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,227
Dad? You always hated church.

266
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,111
Now, for the record, I hated the building,

267
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,819
the people in it
and the spirit it represented.

268
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,990
I never hated the church itself.

269
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,159
And now, finally, I believe
in something bigger than myself.

270
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,660
The only thing bigger than you
is you tomorrow.

271
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,413
Why, you little...

272
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,794
lamb.

273
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,791
Oh. Mustn't... kill own son.

274
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,044
Only God can do that.

Church bulletin? Church bulletin?

286
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,946
Church... (gasps)

287
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,408
Someone finally took one.

288
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,498
I'm mentioned in it 'cause I'm sick.

289
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,011
Sorry, Maggie.
I just don't have the touch today.

290
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,549
(burps)

291
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,013
(burps)

292
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,642
Mom, I found your wedding dress.

293
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,429
(gasps)

294
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,723
How?

295
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,976
Using something
this town has never, ever seen--

296
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,439
good, honest police work.

297
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,480
<i>I staked out the alley</i>

298
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,613
<i>and befriended the garbage man</i>
<i>who took it.</i>

299
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,690
<i>Then he gave it</i>
<i>to a local theater company,</i>

300
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,946
<i>who used it in the first</i>
<i>unsuccessful version</i>

301
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,608
<i>of</i> Mamma Mia.

302
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,196
<i>In a bankruptcy sale, it was</i>
<i>bought by a young couple.</i>

303
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,872
That couple right there.

304
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,292
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

305
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,291
Oh.

306
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,583
Thank you for finding it, sweetie.

307
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,997
And seeing someone else get married in it

308
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,046
is better than having it myself.

309
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,219
You never know, Mom. I'm only eight.

310
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,008
I might get married someday,

311
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,012
even if it's only a green card marriage

312
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,474
to keep a Chinese dissident
from being deported.

313
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,345
We can have the reception at Wong Lee's.

314

Dad, the Oogle street camera's
driving around town today.

320
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,289
Want to go moon it with me?

321
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,294
Son, I'd love to, but I'm a deacon now.

322
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,507
My butt's place is in my pants.

323
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,675
(grunting)

324
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,679
(sighs)
Church songs with clapping.

325
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,475
I don't think this is what
Martin Presbyluther had in mind

326
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,900
when he founded our religion

327
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,438
by sticking his Three Suggestions

328
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,021
under the Pope's windshield wiper.

329
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,106
Mr. Flanders,
this new reverend has thrown tar

330
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,531
in your half-pipe, too?

331
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,610
I don't understand that
on any level, but yes.

332
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,276
Well, let's get Lovejoy back.
Do you know where he is?

333
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,785
He's in a place full
of brimstone and exposed flesh.

334
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,789
You mean he's selling hot tubs?

335
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,961
Yes.

336
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,291
The 7500 is all about jets, jets, jets.

337
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,877
That's the one place
you cannot cut corners.

338
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,633
That, of course, and underwater speakers.

339
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,085
-That sounds expensive.
-I need this, Apu.

340
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,046
Sir, can you please turn up the bubbles

341
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,136
so we can argue in private here?

342
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,561
We wouldn't have to do this
if you remembered your Hindi.

343
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,931
Oh, I remember it.

344
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,807
I'm just pretending
I can't understand you.

345
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,064
Reverend, we want you to come back.

346
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,806
Well, let's face it.

347
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,398
I wasn't cut out for that job.

348
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,073
Nobody listened.

349
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,491
Look, the boy's not even listening now.

350
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,700
He's right-- these underwater
speakers are amazing.

351
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,742
(Bart hums a tune underwater)

352
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,156
Reverend, this is just
the kind of tomfoolery

353
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,115
that's been on the upswing since you left.

354
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,996
Pure, unadulterated tomfoolery!

355
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,133
We shall take the 7500.

356
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,250
And not a single jet more!

357
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,007
Sorry, Ned.

358
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,759
I finally found my calling.

359
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,340
How are you guys fixed for decking?

360
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,426
Oh, what a surprise.

361
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,432
A huge new expense
you didn't tell us about.

362
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,135
We've lost him.

363
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,095
Buddy, there's a 50 in my vest pocket.

364
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,685
-Will you buy us some beers?
-(gasps)

365
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,943
The only cool thing about my dad
was that he hated church.

366
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,606
And now he's turned into
a fat version of Flanders.

367
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,406
-No offense.
-None taken.

368
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,621
(Flanders scoffs)
God doesn't need Twitter to reach people.

369
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,252
He uses leprosy and plagues.

370
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,908
Hmm. Plagues.

371
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,883
{\an8}Ew, locusts.

372
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,210
{\an8}Darkness. Yawn.

373
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,335
{\an8}(gasps) Bingo!

374
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,592
Flanders, are you willing to get Lovejoy
back by hook or by crook?

375
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,215
Neither, and I don't like it

376
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,551
when other people rhyme.

377
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,216
Yes, but if I do something,

378
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,524
-will you look the other way?
-Hmm.

379
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,428
I'd like to turn in this boy

380
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,847
for thinking about doing
something naughty,

381
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,595
and myself for waiting 30 seconds

382
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,857
before bringing him here.

383
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,768
Whatever. Take 'em away, boys.

384
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,647
And that's why Flanders
will never, ever be

385
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,824
my partner in crime again.

386
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,151
Thanks for bailing me out.

387
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,396
Yeah, but don't push it.

388
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,157
There's only so many times

389
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,699
I can tell Nana it's my birthday.

390
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,492
Now, what's this prank?

391
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,366
First, we got every dead bedbug in town.

392
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,914
To think those exterminators were just

393
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,668
going to throw these beauties away.

394
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,050
Now, to leave a nice, clean
trail of bugs out of the swamp.

395
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,878
The frogs follow, and Hooper's
got a plague he can't handle.

396
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,097
(frogs croaking)

397
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,059
Ugh! One of these bedbugs is still alive.

398
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,430
(croaking)

399
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,056
(sighs) Much better.

400
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,604
(croaking)

401
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,790
(frogs croaking)

402
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,856
(murmuring)

403
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,362
(frogs croaking)

404
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,533
(crowd screaming and gasping)

405
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,117
Ow! He took my contact!

406
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,291
Aah! Now I got two in one eye!

407
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,120
(people yelling and screaming)

408
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,865
Remember you said,
"When hell freezes over?"

409
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,088
I think this is close enough.

410
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,588
Huh. I'm in no position to argue.

411
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,881
(moaning)

412
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,763
(electrical zapping)

413
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,353
(yelling and muttering)

414
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,020
-Help! Help!
-What should we do?

415
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,114
We need guidance.

416
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,149
I have a plan.
Save your civic leaders.

417
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,614
Calm yourselves. In times like this,

418
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,655
there's one almighty being
we can put our faith in--

419
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,319
Reverend Hooper.

420
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,078
It's okay, everyone.

421
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,500
Who here has seen <i>The Blind Side</i>
with Sandy Bullock?

422
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,329
Remember when Big Mike was overwhelmed
with scholarship offers?

423
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,535
Well, that's kind of
how we are with these frogs.

424
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,535
To hell with your references.

425
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,797
(crowd murmuring angrily)

426
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,339
We're dying here.

427
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,012
I'm more frog than Moe.

428
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,550
(grunting)

429
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,804
Ribbet. Ribbet.

430
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,716
Do something.

431
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,724
Um, video games, uh, Twitter.

432
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,386
Uh, <i>How to Train Your Dragon.</i>

433
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,354
<i>Fight Club.</i> Aah!

434
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,020
The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.

435
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,187
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

436
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,197
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

437
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,950
He restoreth my soul.

438
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,703
His words have soothed
the amphibious beasts!

439
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,208
(gasps)
His boringness saved us all.

440
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,552
(chanting)
Lovejoy! Lovejoy! Lovejoy!

441
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,802
{\an8}Where do you think you're going?

442
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,429
Let us pray.

443
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,149
All right, we collected
all the personal information

444
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,401
from Flanders comma Ned.

445
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,733
Let's move on to the next house.

446
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,067
Hmm, that's weird.

447
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:41,112
Four spheres-- two small, two gigantic.

448
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,948
Better zoom in.

449
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,373
-(yells)
-Compliments of the deacon.

450
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,373
