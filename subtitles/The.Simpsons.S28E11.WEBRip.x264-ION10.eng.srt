{\an8}Ooh, sushi!

26
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,498
{\an8}Okay, I read this whole book
while your father

00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,792
{\an8}was hospitalized for food poisoning,

28
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,546

00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,128

{\an8}En-tidy-ment?
I thought this family meeting

32
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,386
{\an8}was about reducing the carbon footprint

33
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,681
{\an8}-of my college fund.
-Done and done.

34
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,635
{\an8}Wait, wait. Why is it so easy?

35
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,635
{\an8}-Moving on.
-Oh, man!

36
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,687
{\an8}I thought your mother
was gonna tell us that Grampa died.

37
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,522
{\an8}Well, the meeting ain't over yet.

{\an8}Take every item you own and ask--

40
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,947
{\an8}does it still bring me joy?

41
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,530
{\an8}If yes, then you keep it.

42
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,325
{\an8}If not, you thank it for its service

43
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,989
{\an8}-and throw it away.

{\an8}Not anymore. (grunts)

46
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,463
{\an8}Not my "Oh, crap, I'm 50" coaster!

47
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,633
{\an8}You're not 50,
and I don't like the word "crap."

48
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,803
{\an8}And I worry you drink too much beer.

49
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,432
{\an8}But the rest of it's good, right?

50
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,968
{\an8}That's all there is to it.

51
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,351
{\an8}Marge, before you go cuckoo
with cleanliness

52
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,269
{\an8}and throw everything out,
think of the kids.

53
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,978
{\an8}The kids working in overseas factories
to make this crap.

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,560
{\an8}It's time for it to go.

55
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,185

00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,943
-(grunts)
-No one ever thanked me

57
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,275
when I was in the service.

58
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,239
All I got was a pack of cigarettes
and a college education!

59
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,162
Speaking of college education...

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,080

Let's see. Car door handles,
a telescope, and a hose.

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,079

64
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,215

66
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,729
Ha-ha-ho! Thank you, Galileo.

67
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,098
Good-bye, Businesswoman Malibu Stacy,

68
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,647
Plus-Size Malibu Stacy,

69
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,900
and Nongender-Normative Malibu Stacy.

70
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:56,532
Your attempts to enter
the 21st century brought joy to no one.

71
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,241
Are they worth anything?

72
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,531
Oh, I'm afraid not, no.

73
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,025
Take 'em.

74
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,953
Aha!

75
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,616
Oh, right, because up until now
I've been such a great guy.

76
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,876
You don't want to get rid
of this fake barf?

77
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,289
Still gives me joy.

78
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,627
This pencil sharpener shaped like a nose?

79
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,722
That's what it is?
Now I like it even more!

80
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,339
Is there anything you want to get rid of?

81
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,296
Hmm, let's see.

82
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,007
Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy...

83
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,348
Milhouse, get out of the way.

84
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,022
Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy,
and Lisa's only "B."

85
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,062
-Super joy.
-Huh! It's in phys ed!

86
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,816
I don't want to alarm you,
but grade point average--

87
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,739

(humming happily)

90
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,004
Listen, Marge, you've had me
throw a lot of things away

91
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,582
that I really loved.

92
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,167
At long last, I'm Mr. Plow!

93
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,094
I was thinking we might want to save
my 2014 Joke-A-Day calendar,

94
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,724
'cause the calendar's the same
in the year 2031,

95
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,892
and we're really gonna need
some laughs then

96
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,561
after World War China.

97
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,389
There is one thing of yours

98
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,194
that's not giving us much joy anymore.

99
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,859
(quietly) You know what's not
giving me joy is that Japanese book.

100
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,318
-What'd you say?
-Nothing.

101
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,528
What I'm talking about is... Plopper.

102
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,359

00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,001
{\an8}but I'm the only one
who takes care of him.

108
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,133
{\an8}How hard can it be
to clean up after a pig?

109
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,883
{\an8}(Marge grunts)

110
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,634
Okay, okay, I hear you, Marge.

111
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,100
Look, I'm the only one
who feeds him, cleans him,

112
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,681
and maintains his wallow.

113
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,096
I am grateful beyond words.

114
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,265
I bet you didn't even know
it was called a wallow.

115
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,114
-I certainly did!
-Then tell me what it's called.

116
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,610
-What what was called?
-The word I just said.

117
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,282
Marge, I don't know what the word is.

118
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,361
Let's not wallow in this all day.

119
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:08,116
(groans) Please, just promise
you'll find him a new place to live.

120
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,201
-(Plopper grunting)
-Aw, ha-ha-ha.

121
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,207
That's our Christmas card!

122
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,039
(grunting, squealing)

123
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,094
The music of our lives.

124
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,838
If you don't find a home for that pig,
I'm going to withhold--

125
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,382
No, whatever you're going to withhold,
anything but that!

126
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,046
I'll find him a home!

127
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,973
Boy, I really don't want
to get rid of the pig.

128
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,426
Can you talk to your mother?

129
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,636
-We have a pig?
-Oh, it's hopeless.

130
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,096
You know, I love this animal,

131
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,306
so I'm gonna be very selective
with his new owner.

132
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,822
Okay. World's best pig,

133
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,322
non-smoker only.

134
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,324
By which I mean he can't end up
in your smoker.

135
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,736
(electronic ding)

136
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,696
Wow, I've already got a taker.

137
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,246
Well, I'm sure he's a nice,
reputable guy.

138
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,751
(rock music playing)

139
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,052
Hello there.

140
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,959
Are you here for my pig?

141
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,337
I might be.

142
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,144
I have to make sure the bacon
is worth the takin'.

143
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,548
You better not eat him!

144
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,636
I have to talk to him
every night on the phone.

145
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,311
-We have a code word.
-Um, is it "oink"?

146
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,561
Damn it! I'm not giving him to you!

147
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,063
You make guys with
a windowless van look bad!

148
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,727
-Need a ride?
-Sure.

149
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,074
Hey, how you doing? (hums)

150
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,065
-(rock music playing)
-HOMER: So, what do you do?

151
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,330
Oh, my God!

152
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,120
(Plopper squeals)

153
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,123
A decluttered life is a happy life.

154
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,285
A decluttered life
is a happy life.

155
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,294
A decluttered life is a h-- (gasps)

156
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,546
Joyce Carol Oates!

157
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,588
(gasps) Oh, no!

158
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,552
I threw out my autograph book!

159
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,592
Are you nuts? You had Dean Cain!

160
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,386
I know I had Dean Cain!

161
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,641
Dad, maybe she'll sign a menu.

162
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,272
Books and checks-- that's all I sign.

163
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,153
What are you doin'?

164
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,321
You keep-a that unsliced prosciutto
outside my restaurant!

165
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,901
Wait. How come he can bring a dog in,

166
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,157
but my pig has to stay outside,
like a common snowman?

167
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,160
Because that-a dog is a therapy animal.

168
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,583
He's-a licensed to help calm
those with anxiety.

169
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,923
Don't lick my face--
the makeup's lead-based.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,710
But for calming down,
I prefer my mama's methods.

171
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,415
Shut up!

172
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,336
She don't even-a work here.
(exclaims in Italian)

173
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,255
So if I get that anxiety diagnosis,

174
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,135
Plopper could follow me anywhere.

175
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,642
He could live in my office!

176
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,103
Hey, what are the symptoms of anxiety?

177
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,154
Oh, no, don't try that, Dad.
You might get into trouble.

178
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,269
Just the thought of it
is making me sweat.

179
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,186
And my heart is palpitating.

180
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,114
Lisa, honey, Daddy will help you,

181
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,113
right after you tell me
the symptoms of anxiety.

182
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,696
(gasping) You're... looking at them!

183
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,742
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

184
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,656
-It's okay.
-It's... I know.

185
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,365
-I'm better now.
-It's gonna be okay.

186
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,325
-It's okay. I'm better now.
-All right, calm down.

187
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,285
Ooh. Heart's racing like a rabbit.

188
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,786
I have to sit down.

189
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,377
Oh, isn't that-a sweet?

190
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:10,302
All the little children
have-a the adult anxiety now.

191
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,723
Uh, yeah, I'm really anxious, Doc.

192
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,682
I'm not sleeping at night,
I'm not sleeping at work...

193
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,933
Okay, okay, I get it.

194
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,685
Here's your prescription
for medicinal marijuana.

195
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,308
I don't want weed!

196
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,475
I'd like a letter for a therapy animal

197
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,654
of the pig persuasion.

198
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,942
Oh, you fakers disgust me!

199
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,146
Get out! You're harshing my clinic.

200
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,697
How many opioids would you like?

201
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,161
I don't want any!

202
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,291
Oh, come on, you've got to be
dependent on something.

203
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,619
I just want a prescription
for a therapy pig.

204
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,576
Fine. Plus five opioids.

205
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,997
<i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco.</i>

206
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,256
And one for the doctor.

207
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,718
Ah, ha.

208
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,507
Gee, I didn't realize
you had gone this far.

209
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,176
A great musician only needs
her instrument.

210
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,975
And underwear--
'cause this dress is mighty short.

211
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,769
Time for a riff of joy.

212
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,273
(playing mournful melody)

213
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,360
Uh?

214
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,782
Holding this,
I feel only hours of tedious practice.

215
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,452
Where is the joy?

216
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,910
(playing mournful melody)

217
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,673
That was beautiful, honey!

218
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,129
No, it wasn't.

219
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,538
I finally feel about my sax...

220
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,248
the way you all do.

221
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,168
(long, deep gasp)

222
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,467
(long, squealing gasp)

223
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,011
Okay, Plopper,
I'm going to the little pigs' room.

224
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,637
Can you cover for me? Good, good.

225
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,845
Not that many mistakes at all.

226
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,685
(alarm blaring)

227
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,311
(alarm stops)

228
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,570
Okay, is that Homer
or a pig that looks just like him?

229
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,454
(snorting, squealing)

230
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,990
Sounds like Homer,
but smells like truffles.

231
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,115
Toss in a bag of chips.

232
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,790
(snorting, squealing)

233
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,422
Yep, that's Homer.

234
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,709
-Who's Homer?
-The pig behind the desk.

235
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,463
To a less secure man, being mistaken
for a pig would be a wakeup call.

236
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,586
This is great.

237
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,973
All I had to do was say I'm crazy
on my permanent record,

238
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,891
and I get to bring a pig to work.

239
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,009
-Yeah, they are pretty lax here.
-That's right.

240
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,347
I got turned down by McDonald's,

241
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,641
but here they paid me
the whole year I was in jail.

242
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,225
You said you were getting rid of him.

243
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,811
Marge, I'll take him
to work and to Moe's.

244
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,147
He'll be like me--
you'll barely see him.

245
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,403
(sighs) Fine.

246
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,740
(clinking)

247
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,492
This is so hard for me to say,

248
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,834
but my saxophone no longer gives me joy.

249
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,081
I am giving it away.

250
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,873
Aw, that is really, really sad.

251
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,708
Wow, you understand how I feel.

252
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,214
Yes, because I feel about my pig

253
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,046
the way you used to feel
about your honk-a-ma-flute.

254
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,013
Okay, back to what really matters.

255
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,433
So, I get the ball,
and I pivot to first...

256
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,682
-(grunts) Ooh! Oh...
-Oh, my God! (stammers)

257
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,524
-I'm so sorry, Dad!
-Accidents happen.

258
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,602
Wow, Homie.

259
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,477
Spilled gravy is one of your top three
strangulation triggers.

260
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,566
I could never strangle a boy...

261
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,491
in front of the pig.

262
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,910
Huh. I think he really has become
a support animal for you.

263
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,490
He's totally changed
the way I look at animals.

264
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,407
Pass the pork chops.

265
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,668
(chuckles)
Everybody's looking at us.

266
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,014
It's like bringing
Elizabeth Taylor to the Oscars.

267
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,973
{\an8}(sighs)

268
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,931
Can I pet your pig?

269
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,512
Of course! You can all pet him!

270
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,773
Kiss both ends.

271
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,811
Homie, those kids' hands
are covered in barbeque sauce.

272
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,356
I know someone who's gonna
get a sink bath tonight.

273
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,861
(children laughing)

274
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,907
(barking)

275
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,414
(growls)

276
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,423
(barking)

277
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,463
No! Get away from him! I'll spray you!

278
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,133
Dad, no!
That's a snake from the petting zoo!

279
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,763
-(hissing)
-(gasps)

280
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,669

281
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,258

282
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,764
(growling)

283
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,644
(panting) Oh, my God!

284
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,556
Oh, my God! (panting)

285
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,725
I can't breathe. Chest pounding.

286
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,734
-What's happening to me?!
-You're having an anxiety attack.

287
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,897
There really is such a thing?!

288
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,578
Oh, the dogs contused his baby back ribs.

289
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,159
Of course, there is the luau option.

290
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,996
I will not subject him to something
that has three vowels in a row.

291
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,383
Uh, sir, I'm kind of worried
about a lawsuit.

292
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,510
Our Lloyd's of London policy
excludes the hounds.

293
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,878
Ooh! Damn that Lloyd.

294
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,085
He's borne a grudge ever since
I took his girl to see Lunardi's balloon.

295
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,426
-What are you talking about?
-I'm not sure myself.

296
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,563
But don't worry,
I'll have your swine taken care of

297
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,730
right here in the finest
sanatorium money can buy.

298
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,690
HOMER: What the...

299
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,360
Maybe he should go to an animal hospital.

300
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,399
Oh, we'll take good care of Spider-Pig.

301
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,363
(gasps) You know his secret identity?

302
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,403
Mm-hmm. And your son is El Barto.

303
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,527
These things are very easy to figure out.

304
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,374
We'll take good care of him!

305
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,330
I'm worried, Marge.
His tail is all curly.

306
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,082
It's always been curly.

307
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,463
No, you're thinking of Bart
when he was a baby.

308
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,541
But this is no time to argue.

309
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,666
He'll be fine.

310
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,462
This place seems even nicer
than the Mayo Clinic.

311
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,967
Mayo Clinic, eh?

312
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,137
Should we slice him diagonally
or just cut off the crust?

313
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,600
-Who cares? It's hopeless.
-You fools.

314
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,021
I'll save him like I've saved
a million lunches!

315
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,980
(pop)

316
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,100
(screaming)

317
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,654
(exhales) It gets harder every time.

318
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,446
Mmm.

319
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,329
You were imagining a clinic
full of mayonnaise doctors, weren't you?

320
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,158
Some were just interns.

321
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,583
Whoa! What happened to your stuff?

322
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,253
Gave it all away. Nothing brings me joy.

323
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,083
Lis, for what it's worth,

324
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,418
there was a time
I thought my life was horrible, too.

325
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,423
-Really?
-Basically, it was when you were born.

326
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,926
(scoffs) Thanks. I'm all cheered up.

327
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,469
But I got over it.

328
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,012
And your older, smarter brother
is going to help you.

329
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,426
Let's put our heads together.

330
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,885
-(heads click)
-Wow.

331
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,765
This actually is making me smarter.

332
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,977
And next week, we will have the MRT,
Mandatory Required Test.

333
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:47,106
Students must bring two pencils
and a quiet lunch.
