{\an8}And then,
the handsome prince realized

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,630
{\an8}he had to go
to the bathroom really bad.

16
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,764
{\an8}But the evil ogre, Barney,
had left the men's room

17
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,552
{\an8}in the most wicked condition.

18
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,926
{\an8}So, the prince went out back
to the enchanted alley...

19
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,774
{\an8}That's not a fairy tale.
It's something

20
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,309
{\an8}that happened to you at Moe's.

21
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,192
{\an8}Shh! Anyway, the prince

22
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,019
{\an8}passed out for a hundred years

23
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,685
{\an8}until he was awakened
by the kiss of a noble raccoon.

24
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,235
{\an8}And thank you, God

25
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,778
{\an8}for the bad things adults do

26
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,201
{\an8}which distract attention
from stuff I'm doing.

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,490
{\an8}Amen.

28
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,573
{\an8}He's also thankful

29
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,908
{\an8}for your bounty, Lord.

30
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,332
{\an8}Good save, Mom. 'Night.

31
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,750
{\an8}Sweet dreams, honey.

32
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,162
{\an8}Uh, Mom?

33
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,705
{\an8}Will you help me
with my project?

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,381
{\an8}I need to make a working model

35
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,839
{\an8}of the digestive system.

36
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,249
{\an8}Of course, honey.

37
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,797
{\an8}Thanks. It's due tomorrow.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,380
{\an8}Tomorrow?!
Well, that's too bad, mister.

39
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,676
{\an8}I'm not going to bail
you out this time.

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,800
{\an8}You're right, Mom. I understand.

41
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,637
{\an8}All right.
I'll get you the materials

42
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,984
{\an8}but you're building it.

43
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,059
{\an8}OK.

44
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,983
{\an8}Oh, I'll make the whole thing.

45
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,901
{\an8}OK, paper-mache mix,
pipe cleaners,

46
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,065
{\an8}pig intestines and sparkle paint.

47
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,195
{\an8}You're a lifesaver, Apu.

48
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,032
{\an8}All the other stores are closed.

49
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,367
{\an8}(gasps) At 11:30?

50
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,372
{\an8}But this is the peak hour
for stoned teenagers

51
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,745
{\an8}buying shiny things.

52
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,832
{\an8}Whoa!

53
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,417
{\an8}It's a living mirror!

54
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,050
{\an8}Cool hat!

55
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,630
{\an8}I'm glad you're always here.

56
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,125
{\an8}But isn't it a little
rough on your marriage?

57
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,887
{\an8}You know, Manjula understands.

58
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,679
{\an8}I told her that endless toil
is the only true path

59
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,393
{\an8}out of this jerkwater burg.

60
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,103
{\an8}Well, when you have a free night,

61
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,024
{\an8}we'd love to have you two
over for dinner.

62
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,852
{\an8}Oh, please, do not be insane.

63
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,437
{\an8}You hosted our wedding!

64
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,282
{\an8}The least we can do
is have you over for dinner.

65
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,528
{\an8}It is payback time, and this time...

66
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,324
{\an8}it's personal.

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,830

69

{\an8}Some of your best work.

{\an8}Oh, it sounds so real!

{\an8}I didn't turn it on yet.

74
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,297
{\an8}Uhh, oh, I'm never eating

75
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,800
{\an8}chili again.

76
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,012
{\an8}Ooh, chili!

77
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,888
{\an8}Nelson, what are you doing?

78
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,517
{\an8}I'm solving world hunger.

{\an8}-I hope you're happy, Nelson.
-Very.

84
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,544
{\an8}But I can't help wondering
where I go from here.

85
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,748
{\an8}Stop worrying, Apu.

86
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,674
{\an8}The Kwik-E-Mart is in good hands.

87
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,673
{\an8}I'm not checking up on you, Sanjay.

88
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,165
{\an8}I am simply asking you

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,257
{\an8}how many pennies you have left.

90
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,092
{\an8}(gasps)
Seven? I'll be right there.

91
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,177
{\an8}No, he won't.

92
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,893
{\an8}Apu's entertaining tonight.

93
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,853
{\an8}If you need pennies,
take them from Jerry's jar.

-This is why I married you.

{\an8}Ooh, what an outfit!

96

{\an8}You are one hot mama!

97
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,244
{\an8}You think so?

98
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,698
{\an8}I can't let you in the store

99
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,318
{\an8}like that
because you are smoking.

100
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,405
{\an8}Oh! Apu.

101
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,081
{\an8}(doorbell ringing)

102
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,909
{\an8}Maybe we should not

{\an8}-answer it, huh?
-(door creaks)

104
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,413
{\an8}Door's unlocked.

105
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,117
{\an8}Oh, Marge, Homer,

106
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,247
{\an8}welcome!

107
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,673
{\an8}Yes, welcome.

108
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,961
{\an8}What a lovely home!

109
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,545
{\an8}Oh, you are too kind, Marge.

110
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,931
{\an8}I am sure you have noticed
the many small imperfections

111
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,390
{\an8}that fill me with shame.

112
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,679
{\an8}Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

113
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:10,523
{\an8}If anything, your home
makes me ashamed of my home.

114
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,981
{\an8}Well, let us just say
we both feel bad.

115
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,062
{\an8}Deal.

{\an8}Indian pop singer?

{\an8}Oh, don't make me choose.

133
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,525

{\an8}Eh.

139
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,119
{\an8}I don't understand, Marge.

140
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,208
{\an8}Doesn't Homer work a standard
18-hour day?

145
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,843
{\an8}Well, pretty much.

146
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,218

for a game of Ganesh-Gnop?

149
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,114
{\an8}You told me it was
an American tradition

150
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,398
{\an8}to work all the time
and never see your wife.

151
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,902
{\an8}Yes, perhaps
I stretched the truth a bit,

152
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,324
{\an8}but the Kwik-E-Mart
is a harsh mistress.

153
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,164
{\an8}I think you just
don't want to see me!

154
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,909
{\an8}Eh! Maybe we should just
close the door.

00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,242
{\an8}-Oh, dear.
-Hmm!

170
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,291
{\an8}(car honking)

171
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,749
{\an8}MARGE: Either put the book down

172
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,869
{\an8}or let me drive.

173
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,792
{\an8}HOMER: Hey, they stole our idea.

174
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,668
{\an8}-See? Look.
-MARGE: Ooh!

175
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,764
{\an8}(tires screeching)

176
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,644
{\an8}"I cherish you, my precious."
Uh... Nah.

177
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,925
{\an8}"You're a heck
of a blacksmith."

178
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,477
{\an8}Nah, I already got him one.

179
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,438
{\an8}"You're a-peeling"

180
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,149
{\an8}"Let's never split!"

181
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,269
{\an8}(laughing)

182
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,896
{\an8}That's funny
'cause they're monkeys.

183
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,235
{\an8}So long, rejects.

184
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,531
{\an8}(grunting)

185
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,874
{\an8}Stupid cards.

186
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,695
{\an8}Morning, Apu.

187
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,367
{\an8}Still in hot water
with the squaw?

188
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,076
{\an8}Worse than ever, I'm afraid.

189
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,496
{\an8}My shameful neglect

190
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,134
{\an8}has made her feel unloved.

191
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,961
{\an8}Now I fear she will leave me.

192
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,506
{\an8}Oh, she's not going to leave you
right before Valentine's Day.

193
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,341
{\an8}That would be like going
to an air show

194
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,256
{\an8}and leaving before the plane crash.

195
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,928
{\an8}Oh, you are right.

196
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,103
{\an8}There's still seven days

197
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,311
{\an8}before Valentine's.

198
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,060
{\an8}Ah! Seven chances to prove

199
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,692
{\an8}my love for sweet Manjula.

200
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,809
{\an8}(slurps)
Sweet mint julep...

201
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,107
{\an8}I'll be at Moe's.

202
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,687
{\an8}Hmm?

203
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,454
{\an8}(growling and whimpering)

204
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,782
{\an8}Come on, boy, come on.

205
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,243
{\an8}Dad, the vet says
we shouldn't make him

206
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,617
{\an8}fetch the Sunday paper.

207
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,913
{\an8}(whimpering)

208
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,996
{\an8}Good dog. Good doggie.

209
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,918
{\an8}"Tax hike approved."

210
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,751
{\an8}Bad dog. Bad, bad dog.

211
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,376
{\an8}(whimpering)

212
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,666
{\an8}Now to trim away the fat.

213
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,007
{\an8}"Outlook." Ugh!

214
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,262
{\an8}"Vista." No.

215
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,223
{\an8}"Spotlight." Ugh! "Mosaic." Nah.

216
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,217
{\an8}I'd love to look at "Scullery
Week" if you're through.

217
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,226
{\an8}Oh! Sorry, Marge.
That's in my stockpile.

218
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,768
{\an8}You can have this.

219
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,941
{\an8}This is about investment opportunities

220
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
{\an8}in Yemen.

221
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,105
{\an8}Give me that!

222
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,859
{\an8}All right, the personals.

223
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,571
{\an8}Hmm... (humming)

224
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,151
{\an8}"Successful mayor-type

225
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,606
{\an8}seeks open-minded, discreet
cheerleader-type."

226
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,157
{\an8}Oh, that's sweet.

227
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,530
{\an8}Ah, here's one.
"Desperately seeking suction--"

228
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,077
{\an8}Hey, look at this one!

229
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,660
{\an8}(gasping) It's a poem.

230
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,705
{\an8}(gasps) From Apu!

231
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,709
{\an8}Well, don't just gasp. Read it.

232
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,751
{\an8}"My darling bride, Manjula.

233
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,705
{\an8}I hereby mend my ways.

234
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,755
{\an8}I'll shower you with Valentines

235
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,169
{\an8}for seven love-filled days."

236
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,218
{\an8}Oh, how romantic!

237
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,352
{\an8}I used to take out ads like that

238
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,059
{\an8}when we were newlyweds.

239
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,139
{\an8}The only ad you took out
was to sell our lawnmower.

240
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,475
{\an8}We sold it, didn't we?

241
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,145
{\an8}(both grunting)

242
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:13,204
{\an8}Until last night, I never knew
Apu could be so romantic.

243
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,071
{\an8}I can't believe it.

244
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,406
{\an8}He covered your whole bed

245
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,410
{\an8}with wildflowers!

246
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,002
{\an8}Oh, I'm sure Homer has
done that for you.

247
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,908
{\an8}Hmm. Sometimes I find pickle
slices in the sheets.

248
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,793
{\an8}And he says I've got
six more surprises coming.

249
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,837
{\an8}I feel like the luckiest
woman in Springfield.

250
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,755
{\an8}-(squawking)
-(screams)

251
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,722
{\an8}-Oh!
-(squawks)

252
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,140
{\an8}<i>♪ He loves the nightlife ♪</i>

253
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,888
{\an8}<i>♪ He loves Manjula ♪</i>

254
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,060
{\an8}<i>♪ The man they call Apu ♪</i>

255
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,809
{\an8}<i>♪ Oh, yeah! ♪ </i>(squawks)

256
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,021
{\an8}He has trained a bird to sing to me.

257
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,981
{\an8}Limo out front. Tickets to opera.

258
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,442
{\an8}Front row loge. (squawks)

259
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,611
{\an8}(groans)

260
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,359
{\an8}Just once, I'd like a parrot

261
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,611
{\an8}to say that to me.

262
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,105
{\an8}Then the bird sang
"I Love the Nightlife"

263
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,856
{\an8}with clever new lyrics.

264
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,567
{\an8}Ugh! I hate that song.

265
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,658
{\an8}I do, too, but it was sweet.

266
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,213
{\an8}Women really like that
sort of thing, Homie.

267
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,708
{\an8}Don't worry, honey.

268
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,380
{\an8}I got something
really special planned

269
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,959
{\an8}for Valentine's Day.

270
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,634
{\an8}It's not that monkey card

271
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,382
{\an8}I found in the car, is it?

272
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,804
{\an8}Wouldn't you like to know?

273
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,842
{\an8}(groans)

274
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,345
{\an8}A chocolate husband!

275
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,774
{\an8}Oh, how darling!

276
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,063
{\an8}APU (muffled): Help! I can't breathe!

277
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,477
{\an8}Oh, Apu!

278
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,237
{\an8}Oh, you are the sweetest
filling of all.

279
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,820
{\an8}(panting)
Air... I need air.

280
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,116
{\an8}Oh, Apu!

281
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,329
{\an8}Oh! My ears are filled with nougat.

282
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,660
{\an8}Oh, dear!

283
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,204
{\an8}There's a nut in my eye.

284
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,383
{\an8}So then, the second salesman
says, "That's OK.

285
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,788
{\an8}I just ate
all the hot buttered corn."

286
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,667
{\an8}(laughing)

287
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,165
{\an8}You like that one, baby?

288
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,627
{\an8}-Hmm.
-Sarah, what's wrong?

289
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,471
{\an8}Usually after two or three
truly tasteless jokes,

290
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,684
{\an8}you're all over me.

291
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,813
{\an8}Manjula got to see

292
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,889
{\an8}<i>La bohème</i>.

293
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,641
{\an8}Sarah, please.
Sarah, it's $10 a pill.

{\an8}See? The problem's communication.

302
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,875
{\an8}Too much communication.

303
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,184
{\an8}Homer, I've gone through
seven years of receipts

304
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,089
{\an8}and you've spent less on gifts for me

305
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,598
{\an8}than you have on temporary tattoos.

306
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
{\an8}But Marge, it's worth it!

307
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,266

{\an8}Here, boy!

311
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,267

had me bumped

319
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,705
{\an8}back to 200 feet.

-That's too far.

{\an8}HOMER: And ask yourselves, people,

322
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,335
{\an8}who's to blame for all this?

323
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,175
{\an8}Well, I guess we are.

324
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,470
{\an8}I suppose I do take Maude
for granted.

325
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,894
{\an8}I've done some of that myself.

326
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,272
{\an8}Will you stop it?

327
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,519
{\an8}It's easy to blame ourselves,

328
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,151
{\an8}but it's even easier to blame Apu.

329
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,859
{\an8}He's making us look bad.

330
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,689

334
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,834
{\an8}(beeps horn)

335
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,325
{\an8}Hey, watch it!
You're all over the road.

336
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,837
{\an8}We've got to stop that traitor Apu.

337
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,420
{\an8}-ALL: Yeah!
-That's right!

338
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,875
{\an8}Right after happy hour.

339
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,465
{\an8}(all agreeing)

340
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,890
{\an8}-BARNEY: I call side seat!
-MOE: Drinking will help us plan.

341
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,104
{\an8}Come on, Apu. Make your move.

342
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,186
{\an8}Maybe he's run out
of romantic ideas.

343
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,023
{\an8}Naw, not our lover boy.

344
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,608
{\an8}If I know his M.O.,

345
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,073
{\an8}he's saved the biggest one
for today.

346
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,573
{\an8}Ah gee, the man's just trying
to show his wife he cares for her.

347
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,697
{\an8}How could we sabotage
his labor of love?

348
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,794
{\an8}I don't know. Gasoline, axes--

349
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,370
{\an8}I got some stuff in the trunk.

350
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,004
{\an8}-Hey, there he goes.
-Let's roll.

351
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,706
{\an8}Uh, Homer, you're driving.

352
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,094
{\an8}Not yet, I'm not.

353
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,590
{\an8}You'll know when I'm driving,

354
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,802
{\an8}and it'll-- (shrieks)

355
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,376
{\an8}Tiffany's, eh?

356
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,547
{\an8}Yeah, looks like

357
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,095
{\an8}Smoochy's going to seal the deal

358
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,598
{\an8}with a diamond
the size of a doll's head.

359
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,521
{\an8}Aw, man, he's making us look like

360
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,270
{\an8}a bunch of cheapskates.

361
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,021
{\an8}Whoa, whoa, my rope came loose.

362
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,571
{\an8}WIGGUM: There he is...
behind that shopping bag.

363
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,979
{\an8}A croissant? What the--

364
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,817
{\an8}Ah, that's right!
They have breakfast

365
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,033
{\an8}at Tiffany's now.

366
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,782
{\an8}Only till 11:00.

367
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,867
{\an8}So, that's it.

368
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,121
{\an8}The crazy nut!

369
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,832
{\an8}He went and bought her a sloop.

370
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,293
{\an8}Well, this is one love boat

371
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,712
{\an8}that won't delight and amuse.

372
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,042
{\an8}Wait, chief,
he's not purchasing a boat.

373
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,381
{\an8}Arr, it's kind of you

374
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,723
{\an8}to deliver these copies of <i>juggs.</i>

375
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,628
{\an8}They'll keep my men from resorting

376
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,387
{\an8}to homosexuality...

377
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,389
{\an8}for about ten minutes.

378
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,431
{\an8}(all laughing)

379
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,644
{\an8}Look who's talking.

380
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,139
{\an8}Arr.

381
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,977
{\an8}This is turning out to be

382
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,521
{\an8}a total waste of time.

383
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,864
{\an8}Not entirely.

384
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,696
{\an8}Aw, geez we've been
following him for hours.

385
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,532
{\an8}You know, with all the energy

386
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,697
{\an8}we're putting
into this sabotage thing,

387
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,996
{\an8}we could have written sonnets
for our wives

388
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,420
{\an8}or learned to tango
or lovingly restored

389
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,579
{\an8}one of those antique...

390
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,207
{\an8}(yells) Ohh!

391
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,804
{\an8}Whew! At least I got a hunk
of Moe's hair.

392
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,340
{\an8}Man, that smarts!

393
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,224
{\an8}Oh, baby, we got him now.

394
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,182
{\an8}There's no escape from the airport.

395
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,390
{\an8}Oh, nuts! We lost him.

396
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,273
{\an8}I told you we shouldn't have
gone for long-term parking.

397
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,811
{\an8}Hey, look! It's Elton John!

398
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,435
{\an8}We had to make
an emergency landing.

399
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,442
{\an8}It's that damned chandelier again.

400
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,784
{\an8}Aah!

401
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,360
{\an8}What's he doing in Springfield?

402
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,744
{\an8}I got it. I got it.

403
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,111
{\an8}Apu must have hired him

404
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,777
{\an8}to sing for Manjula.

405
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,275
{\an8}Not if I can help it.

406
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,237
{\an8}And help it I might.

407
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,288
{\an8}Mr. John, I'm your biggest fan.

408
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,462
{\an8}I've tape-recorded
all your songs off the radio.

409
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,792
{\an8}Oh, that's very sweet!

410
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,877
{\an8}-Have a Grammy.
-Uh...

411
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,801
{\an8}Sir Elton, my noble friends
and I would like

412
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,886
{\an8}to dub you...

413
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,521
{\an8}a Knight of the Grand Concourse.

414
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,564
{\an8}Yeah. It's for all
your charity work and, um...

415
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,694
{\an8}for, uh, you know,
teaching us, um, to love again.

416
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,863
{\an8}Really? I did that?

417
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,282
{\an8}How the hell should I know?
Just get in the cage.

418
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,451
{\an8}What? Oh, hazing the new guy, eh?

419
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,282
{\an8}You know, when I was dubbed
"Sir Elton,"

420
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,867
{\an8}the Queen paddled me silly.

421
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,002
{\an8}Hey, Apu's talking to a skywriter.

422
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,713
{\an8}So, that was his plan all along.

423
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,290
{\an8}If he writes a message
of love over Springfield,

424
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,786
{\an8}we're all screwed.

425
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,130
{\an8}ELTON: Hello? Lads?

426
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,924
{\an8}Don't forget your old pal, Elton.

427
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,549
{\an8}Can anyone hear me?

428
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,051
{\an8}Skycap?

429
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,006
{\an8}OK, here is the message,

430
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,517
{\an8}and please don't skimp on the...
sarin?

431
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,811
{\an8}Don't be frightened.

432
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,316
{\an8}That tank's just
Peace Corps surplus.

433
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,728
{\an8}HOMER: Not so fast, Apu!

434
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,856
{\an8}Homer!
What a delightful coincidence!

435
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,784
{\an8}We're putting an end to your
insane Valentine's rampage.

436
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,164
{\an8}Never again will good, lazy men
have to-- What the...

437
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,912
{\an8}Oh, no, you don't!

438
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,964
{\an8}(panting)

439
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,550
{\an8}Hey, you with the scarf!

440
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,880
{\an8}Stop skywriting!

441
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,764
{\an8}I have to deliver a message.

442
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,761
{\an8}It's the skywriter's code.

443
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,473
{\an8}I am so sick of that damned code!

444
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,231
{\an8}If you won't stop, then I'll stop you!

445
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,598
{\an8}(grunting)

446
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,274
{\an8}What are you doing? Don't do that!

447
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,936
{\an8}(plane whirring)

448
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,861
{\an8}Oh, isn't that sweet?

449
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,157
{\an8}(sighs)
That must be for Manjula.

450
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,529
{\an8}Just once,
I'd like a love note in the sky.

451
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,037
{\an8}(chuckles)

452
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,949
{\an8}(grunting)

453
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,287
{\an8}Lousy message!

454
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,962
{\an8}You crazy fool, you'll kill us all!

455
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,881
{\an8}Correction, kill us both!

456
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
{\an8}(Homer grunting)

457
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,223
{\an8}I love you... it's an angel!

458
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,801
{\an8}Ooh, that's Neddy's pet name for me.

459
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,432
{\an8}I love you, poppin' fresh.

460
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,517
{\an8}Oh, Clancy! (laughs)

461
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,899
{\an8}I love you, Edna K.
It's a little run together,

462
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,112
{\an8}but that's what it says.

463
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,901
{\an8}I love you... cactus?

464
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,947
{\an8}Blobby? Upsilon?

465
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,783
{\an8}Oh, who am I kidding?

466
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,077
{\an8}Homer would never
surprise me like that.

467
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,581
{\an8}(aircraft whizzing)

468
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,582
{\an8}MAN: Doggone it!
You ruined my message!

469
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,882
{\an8}What's the matter with you,
you crazy old buzzard!

470
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,459
{\an8}-Get off me!
-You're making me mad!

471
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,875
{\an8}-(both yelling)
-Oh, me!

472
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,593
{\an8}My humble love note is turning

473
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,933
{\an8}into a Valentine's Day massacre!

474
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,839
{\an8}You think you've got problems.

475
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,507
{\an8}I just chewed my way
out of a dog carrier.

476
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,557
{\an8}Oh! Elton John?

477
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,680
{\an8}That's my name.

478
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,479
{\an8}Well, not really.

479
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,190
{\an8}I hate to sound like
a screaming fan, but...

480
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,521
{\an8}(screams)

481
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,984
{\an8}That maniac nearly killed us.

482
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,526
{\an8}Shall I... take you to the pilot?

483
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,571
{\an8}Ha! You see,
because that is your song...

484
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,565
{\an8}-I heard you.
-Yes, because...

485
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,657
{\an8}someone saved your life tonight.

486
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,373
{\an8}-(laughs)
-Cut it out!

487
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,423
{\an8}Well, well, "The Bitch is Back."
(laughs)

488
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,578
{\an8}(exasperated sigh)

489
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,746
{\an8}Aah! Ow!

490
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,877
{\an8}Durn'it! Why won't you die?

491
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,046
{\an8}(yelling)

492
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,304
{\an8}Oh, prickers! (screaming)

493
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,637
{\an8}Huh? (gasps)

494
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,890
{\an8}(whimpering)

495
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,227
{\an8}(gasps)

496
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,608
{\an8}What in the world?

497
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,031
