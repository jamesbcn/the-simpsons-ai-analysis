He doesn't appreciate me.

Next we have Marge.

She's 34 and trapped in
a loveless sham of a marriage.

00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,525
Hey, turn it up.
I love hearing those wackos.

34
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,065
Tell me 'bout
your husband, Marge.

35
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,868
Well...

36
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,701
When we were dating,
he was sweeter...

37
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,537
and more romantic,
and 40 pounds thinner,

38
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,634
and he had hair,
and he ate with utensils.

39
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,505
What was that last thing
you said?

40
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,005
Hey, isn't that your wife, Homer?

I'm as sure of it as I'm
sure my voice is annoying.

50
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,372
Tonight, the second he comes
through that front door,

51
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,502
you've got to tell him
you're fed up,

52
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,079
and if he doesn't start
loving, you will be leaving.

53

- Can you be that honest?
- Yeah.

56
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,006
You'll tell him right when
he comes home from work.

72
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,452
some peanuts, a hunk
of beef jerky, pickled eggs,

73
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,523
and you're outta here.

goin' home tonight. Jar, please.

- You might say that.

- What?

79
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,834
Marge is right. You are a pig.
You can ask anyone in this bar.

80
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,159
What?
Hey, Barney, am I a pig?

81
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,916
You're no more
of a pig than I am.

82
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,804
- No!
- See? You're a pig.

83
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,509
Barney's a pig.
Larry's a pig. We're all pigs.

84
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,341
Except for one difference.

85
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,097
Once in a while,
we can crawl out of the slop,

86
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,270
hose ourselves off
and act like human beings.

87
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,810
Homer, buy your wife some
flowers and take her out

88
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,404
for a night on the town.

89
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,319
Candles, tablecloth,
the whole nine yards.

90
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,068
Gee, a romantic evening.

91
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,740
Nah, she's too smart
to fall for that.

92
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,069
I'm not done. After dinner,

93
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,775
the two of you are going to check into
the fanciest motel in town...

94
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,947
and not check out
until the next morning,

95
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,077
if you get my drift.

96
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,214
I read you loud and clear.
Heh, heh, heh, heh!

97
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,052
Wow, a quarter past 6:00.

98
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,878
What's keeping Dad?

99
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,633
Yeah, who'd possibly
be late on meatloaf night?

100
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,806
I'd like some flowers.

101
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,518
What kind of flowers?

102
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,478
You know, pretty ones, not dead.

103
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,138
We have some beautiful
long-stem roses.

104
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,478
- They're $55 a dozen.
- One, please.

105
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,328
- Hey, Mom.
- How 'bout some grub?

106
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,834
Aaah!

117
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,482

118
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,402
This'll never work.

119

- Homer.

120
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,205

121
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,248

123
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,586
- Moe's Tavern.
- Is Oliver there?

124
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,920
- Who?
- Oliver Klozoff.

125
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,256

00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,846
I think you're right,
dumplin'. Bart! Get the door!

173

Aye, aye, mambo man.

- Yes. I am Miss Botz.
- Just don't stand there, boy.

178

Help Miss Botz
with her suitcases.

179
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,582
I can handle my own luggage.

180
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,075
Thank you for coming
on such short notice, Miss Botz.

181
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,837
Here are the phone numbers of
the restaurant where we'll be dining,

182
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,300
and the motel where we'll
be spending the night.

183
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,131
You'll have to put Maggie
to bed now,

184
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,426
but Bart and Lisa can stay up
for another hour.

185
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,300
Until then, they can watch
a tape from our video library.

Look, lady, we've seen
the Crappy Little Elves

194
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,204
about 14 billion times.

195
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,077
Maybe we can watch some real TV.

196
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,504
We're gonna watch the tape.

Aw! That's merely suggested
viewing matter, lady.

I said you're gonna watch
this tape.

And you're gonna do what I say,
or I'm gonna do something to you.

201
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,852
And I don't know what that is,

202
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,469
because everybody has always
done what I say.

203
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,068
They all look so tasty,

204
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,779
but I think I'll eat
this one right there.

205
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,490
Why don't you pick one

206
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,320
- that's a little more frisky, sir.
- Why?

207
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,156
Well, when you choose one
that's floating upside down,

208
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,202
it somewhat defeats the purpose
of selecting a live lobster.

209
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:31,998
Okay. Then I'll take that
one there with the beady eyes.

210
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,594
Excellent choice, sir.
May I lead you to your table?

211
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,921
Oui, oui. After you.

212
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,627
And I'll be seeing you later.

213
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,676
Help! Help!

214
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,684
Faster, faster!
We gotta save Bubbles.

215
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,808
Man, I can't take it anymore.

216
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,186
- But I want to see what happens!
- You know what happens.

217
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,534
They find Captain Kook's
treasure.

218
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,460
All the elves dance around
like little green idiots.

Relax. This is cinema vérité.

slow-motion killing starts,

we are about all of this.

345
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,394
These things are heavy.

346
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,603
Just so there's no hard feelings,
here's double your pay.

347
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,607
- No, no, triple.
- Thank you.

348
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,649
Mr. Sampson, can I give
you a bit of advice?

349
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,783
Sure.

350
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,899
Don't turn your back
on that boy for a second.

351
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,074
Ain't that the truth?
You know, one time he...

352
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,926
This way to the scene
of the crime, men!

353
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,206
I got her tied up in the den.

354
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,540
Just a minute, young man!

355
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,126
I don't know what kind
of shenanigans

356
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,401
you've been pulling this time,

357
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,260
but I just had to untie
your baby-sitter

358
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,719
and pay her off so that...

359
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,759
Excuse me, sir,
are you saying to the world

360
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,342
that you just aided and abetted

361
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,637
the escape of the notorious
Baby-sitter Bandit?

362
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,022
- The what?
- The Baby-sitter Bandit.

363
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,400
Are you sure
this microphone works?

364
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:16,019
Well, I wouldn't say I aided her.
This is on, right?

365
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,488
Because actually
it was quite a struggle.

366
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,068
Homer!

367
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,614
Have you ever seen
a kung fu movie?

368
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,738
It was just like that.

369
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,244
But now I know her moves.

370
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,985
So, if you're listening
to me, lady,

371
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,117
you'd better think long and hard

372
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,544
before trying something like
this on Homer Simpson again!

373
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,339
Lord, help me.
I'm just not that bright.

374
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,761
Homer, don't say that.

375
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,591
The way I see it,
if you raise three children

376
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,967
who can knock out and hogtie
a perfect stranger,

377
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,604
you must be
doing something right.

378
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,811
Yeah.

379
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,563
Yeah!

380
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,613
Honey, can we make up again?

381
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,992
My goodness!

382
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,244
Shh!
