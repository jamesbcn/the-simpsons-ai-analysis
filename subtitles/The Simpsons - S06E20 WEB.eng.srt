1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,422
The Simpsons.

2
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,829
Welcome to the 6:00 news
in our brand-new studio.

3
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,664
Looking good, Springfield.

4
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,836
In today's news,
a two-ton rhino

5
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,796
escaped from
the Springfield Zoo,

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,923
but zoo officials
were quick to act,

7
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,843
and Petunia, as she is known,
is safely back in captivity.

8
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,222
In other news,
a three-ton rhino

9
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,324
that escaped
from the zoo last week

10
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,516
is still at large.

11
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,687
All right, who broke my vase?

12
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,064
Who took my test papers

13
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,899
off the refrigerator
and tore them up?

14
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,543
Who spread garbage
all over Flanders' yard

15
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,027
before I got
a chance to?

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,613
Oh, please. This is
senseless destruction

17
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,948
with none of my usual
social commentary.

18
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,244
If it wasn't you,
then who was it?

19
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,624
Well, I'm sure these things
didn't destroy themselves,

20
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:23,833
now, did they?

21
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,418
Did they?

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,299
Hmm, I guess
Bart's not to blame.

23
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,052
He's lucky, too,
because it's spanking season

24
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,971
and I got a hankering
for some spankering.

25
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,267
I don't know why you're
so energetic today, boy,

26
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,728
but prepare
to be worn out.

27
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,901
What's wrong, boy?

28
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,277
Getting tired?

29
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,896
I think there's
really something wrong

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,336
with Santa's
Little Helper.

31
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,338
He was up barking
all night

32
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,341
and dug up the back yard
worse than ever.

33
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,759
My bongo drums!

34
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,719
My strobe light!

35
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,472
My best of Ray Stevens
featuring "The Streak" Album.

36
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,433
So it was the dog
that buried all our stuff.

37
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,519
Yes. The dog.

38
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,605
Oh, my God!

39
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,150
He's got the precious cable TV
cable!

40
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,781
Always use fresh macaroni.

41
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,492
If the box rattles,
throw it away.

42
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,915
Your cable TV
is experiencing difficulties.

43
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,750
Please do not panic.

44
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,879
Resist the temptation
to read or talk to loved ones.

45
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,964
Do not attempt
sexual relations,

46
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,591
as years of TV radiation

47
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,635
have left your genitals
withered and useless.

48
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,053
Well, I'll be damned.

49
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,353
Excuse me. We're having
a problem with our dog.

50
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,064
Lady, I'll tell you what
I'm telling everyone else:

51
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,774
I'm sorry if
your dog went blind

52
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,277
but your gripe is with Hartz Mountain,
not with me.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,363
No! No, our dog
is out of control.

54
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,115
He's wild, destructive

55
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,576
and has little or no respect
for authority.

56
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,038
Hmm. Let me try
a canine-human mind meld.

57
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,290
It's an incredibly rare
psychic power

58
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,875
possessed only by me

59
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,502
and three other clerks
at this store.

60
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,586
Okay.

61
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,010
I'm bored.

62
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,929
I'm restless.

63
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,014
Need change in life.

64
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,309
Like imported leather leash...

65
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,811
Blue contact lenses...

66
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,273
200-volt shock training collar.

67
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,151
Well, problem solved.

68
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,780
Homer, hold on to the wheel!

69
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,490
You've got it.

70
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,368
Hey!

71
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,624
Don't worry. We'll catch him
or run him over trying.

72
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,747
Look, he's headed back
to the greyhound racing track

73
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,670
- where we found him.
- Don't worry,

74
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,522
As soon as they find out
he doesn't have any money,

75
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,547
they'll throw him out.

76
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,675
Believe me, I know.

77
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,183
Ooh, this place is so big.

78
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,559
Do you think
we should split up

79
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,936
and look for him, Homie?

80
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,020
Homie?

81
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,523
Two bucks to win
on number eight.

82
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,694
And have you seen
my beloved dog?

83
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,237
Give me the ticket.

84
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,030
We can't lose!

85
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,157
Look at the name
of the dog I bet on.

86
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,243
"She's The Fastest."

87
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,495
Homer, I don't think
that means necessarily...

88
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,455
And they're off!

89
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,933
She's The Fastest jumps out
to an insurmountable lead.

90
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,875
You're lucky
you got looks, Marge.

91
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,545
As they round the far turn,
it's She's The Fastest

92
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,464
followed by Always Comes in Second
and I'm Number Three.

93
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,425
Yes! Come on, you little horse.

94
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,218
And they're
in the home stretch.

95
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,512
It's... Wait!
Another dog is on the track!

96
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,306
It's Santa's Little Helper!

97
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,766
The mystery dog is gaining
fast on the outside.

98
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,327
Of course,
he could never win this race...

99
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,602
Or could he?

100
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,739
What's Santa's Little Helper
doing to that dog?

101
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,742
Looks like he's trying
to jump over her

102
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,410
but he can't
quite make it.

103
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,746
C'mon boy,
you can do it!

104
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the end...

105
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,624
This is the end of dog racing.

106
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,295
I think they're in love.

107
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,755
Aww!

108
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,472
Aw! So that's what's been wrong
with the little fella.

109
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,266
He misses casual sex.

110
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,185
Can we keep
Santa's girlfriend, Mom?

111
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,311
Please?

112
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,562
But she's not our dog.

113
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,190
She's yours now.

114
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,293
Once they fall in love,
they lose their racing spirit.

115
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,111
Won't you miss her loyalty
and companionship?

116
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,035
Lady, you're all right.

117
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,123
Okay, you can go
out and play

118
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,668
but no more you-know-what in
front of the house, all right?

119
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,421
Hey! What did I just say?

120
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,206
Take it.
It fell on the floor.

121
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,516
Hey, boy, you want
to play fetch?

122
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,438
Oh! Me and Santa's Little
Helper used to be a team,

123
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,148
but he never wants
to play anymore

124
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,649
since his bitch moved in.

125
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,484
Bart, don't ever say
that word again!

126
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,653
Well, that's what she is!
I looked it up.

127
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,156
Well, I'm going to write
the dictionary people

128
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,365
and have that checked.

129
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,409
It feels like
a mistake to me.

130
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,577
Hey, look!

131
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,787
A really small dog

132
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,289
just fell out
of Santa's girlfriend!

133
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,374
Oh, my God!
She's having babies!

134
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,668
Oh, I'm sorry, girl.

135
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,420
I thought you were
just getting fat.

136
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,882
- Look! It's twins!
- No, it's two sets of twins.

137
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,425
Two sets of twins
and a triplet.

138
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,218
Homer! Homer, find a place

139
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,928
for all these little miracles.

140
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,736
Oh, my!

141
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,071
I've never seen
anything like this.

142
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,656
How many more can there be?

143
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,159
Twenty-two...

144
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,161
Twenty-three...

145
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,205
Twenty-four...

146
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,047
Twenty-five!

147
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,102
Wow! 25 puppies!

148
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,442
An army of dogs!

149
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,945
No bully will ever
touch me again.

150
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,657
Hey, jerkface.

151
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,617
You have the face
of a jerk.

152
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,411
All right Simpson,

153
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,996
- you asked for it.
- Get him, boys.

154
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,422
Say, Jimbo,
hope I wasn't out of line

155
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,174
with that
"jerkface" crack.

156
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,447
Oh, Homie,
aren't they adorable?

157
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,116
Yes.

158
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,785
We've waited many years,
but the good Lord

159
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,330
has finally blessed us
with a real family.

160
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,095
Look at Branford II.
Isn't that cute?

161
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,389
He thinks he's one
of the Models, Inc.

162
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,186
Get that cat out of the way!

163
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,736
Ah! My socks!

164
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,997
Mom, why do I have
to wear a flea collar?

165
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,624
It's just easier
this way.

166
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,806
This time...

167
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,687
Yeesh.

168
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,397
This house stinks.

169
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,875
You're not just putting
the new newspapers

170
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,359
over the old ones, are you?

171
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,195
Do you have
a better idea?

172
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,821
Now, I know

173
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,907
we love the puppies
very much,

174
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,409
but I think they're getting
to be a problem.

175
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,411
Yeah, they ate all my socks.

176
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,080
I have to wear Lisa's
to school today.

177
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,831
How do you explain
the culottes, boy?

178
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,500
Well, I have to coordinate,
don't I?

179
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,685
Your mother and I
have been thinking

180
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,002
about giving the puppies away.

181
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,546
- No!
- Mainly your mother.

182
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,090
Is that what we do
in this family?

183
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,716
When someone becomes
an inconvenience,

184
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,843
we just get rid of them?

185
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,140
Hello?

186
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,642
Is anybody there?

187
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,941
All right, we'll give
the dogs one more chance.

188
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,777
As long as the puppies
don't do anything else wrong,

189
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,946
they stay.

190
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,739
On a completely unrelated topic

191
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,784
I'm having a very, very
important dinner party tonight.

192
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,120
Splendid. Who's coming?

193
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,956
Reverend Lovejoy,
your old Army drill sergeant,

194
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,750
and the regional director
of the I.R.S.

195
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,338
Oh, just lovely, Marge.

196
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,757
The whole town will hear
what a perfect evening this was.

197
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,968
How nothing at all
went wrong.

198
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,512
Simpson, this evening
has gone so flawlessly,

199
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,889
I'm gonna forget that

200
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,784
you were mistakenly let
out of the army a month early.

201
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,160
I'm so impressed
by this problem-free evening

202
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,437
that there's no need
for that audit.

203
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,314
A toast to the Simpsons.

204
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,400
And to the delectable turkey...

205
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,527
That's walking
around the table?!

206
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,321
Dear Lord, it's a demon bird!

207
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,833
Simpson, see you at reveille
0500 tomorrow.

208
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,960
See you at the I.R.S.

209
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,754
See you in hell.

210
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,130
From heaven.

211
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,512
Well, we sure could use

212
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,931
a pooch to guard the flock
at the Flanderosa.

213
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,975
It would be nice
to have some companionship

214
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,643
when Mother goes out
on dates.

215
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,146
We could use a new pet
over at the home,

216
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,649
seeing how we accidently
killed that smart-mouthed bird.

217
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,032
They don't like
being broken up.

218
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,242
We've got to be
realistic, kids.

219
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,827
Who's going to have
a big enough heart

220
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,288
to take care of 25 puppies?

221
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:13,250
And I know the little
fellows will love romping around

222
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,045
my many acres,
chasing my many cars,

223
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,338
drinking from
my many toilets.

224
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,923
Who wouldn't?

225
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,966
Mom, don't give
the puppies to him.

226
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,344
He'll be mean to them.

227
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,929
She's right, Homer.

228
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,598
There's something about
his face I don't trust.

229
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,772
Uh... I'm sorry, Mr. Burns,

230
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,733
but you can't have these dogs.

231
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,151
Am I fired?

232
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,487
Hmm? Oh, of course not.

233
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,697
They're your pets.
You can do as you wish.

234
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,074
Good day, everyone.

235
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,912
My, he certainly
took that well.

236
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,956
A little too well,
if you ask me.

237
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,583
I'm sure he's plotting
some brilliant scheme

238
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,960
to get those puppies.

239
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,879
There you go.

240
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,340
There you go.
You, too.

241
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,943
Honestly, sir,
you just don't put the effort

242
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,052
into your schemes
that you used to.

243
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,190
Er, uh, don't worry, folks.

244
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,608
We'll find your wallet.

245
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,110
Dogs!

246
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,462
Chief, you're
getting powdered sugar

247
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,988
all over my floor.

248
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,406
No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.

249
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,325
I'm, uh...
dusting for prints.

250
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,179
We don't have to wait
for the cops.

251
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,430
Who can track
the puppies better

252
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,956
than their own mom and dad?

253
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,791
Let's go find your babies.

254
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,004
Dinner's on, dogs!

255
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,133
I'm sorry, kids.

256
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,552
I don't think we're ever going
to find your greyhounds.

257
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,806
Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you
one of the 25 he got last night.

258
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,531
Who knows what horrible things
he's doing

259
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,366
to those innocent
little puppies?

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,793
Oh, there.

261
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,503
Now, wasn't that heavenly?

262
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,464
Don't you feel better too?

263
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,051
He's giving them a bath.

264
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,469
There you are.

265
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,596
There you go, little fella.

266
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,056
And you.

267
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,977
Smithers, look.

268
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,355
He's standing up.

269
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,981
I've never seen
anything so adorable.

270
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,108
You know who it
reminds me of?

271
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,109
- Benji?
- No.

272
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,236
- Lassie?
- No, no, no.

273
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,947
A person.
You know who I mean.

274
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,740
Snoop Doggy Dog?
Bob Barker?

275
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,367
David Brenner?

276
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,329
No. No. The person who's
always standing and walking.

277
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,413
Rory Calhoun?

278
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,457
That's it.

279
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,292
You stay with me.

280
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,586
You're the pick of the litter.

281
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,175
Maybe we were wrong
about Burns on this one.

282
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,806
Are you sure you want
to go through with this, sir?

283
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,725
You do have a very full
wardrobe as it is.

284
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,354
Yes... but not completely full.

285
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,772
For you see...

286
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,984
Some men hunt for sport.

287
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,319
Others hunt for food.

288
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:32,908
The only thing
I'm hunting for.

289
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:38,497
Is an outfit
that looks good.

290
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,295
See my... vest.

291
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,964
See my vest
made from real.

292
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,090
Gorilla chest.

293
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,175
Feel this sweater.

294
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,302
There's no better
than authentic Irish Setter.

295
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,179
See this hat,
t'was my cat.

296
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,515
My evening wear,
vampire bat.

297
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,392
These white slippers.

298
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,352
Are albino
African endangered rhino.

299
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,354
Grizzly bear underwear.

300
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,398
Turtles' necks,
I've got my share.

301
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,193
Beret of poodle,
on my noodle, it shall rest.

302
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,029
Try my red robin suit.

303
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,448
It comes one breast or two.

304
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,449
See my vest.

305
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,742
See my vest.

306
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,785
See my vest.

307
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,583
Like my...

308
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,044
Loafers, former gophers.

309
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,337
It was that or skin
my chauffeurs.

310
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,924
But a greyhound fur tuxedo
would be best.

311
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,760
So let's prepare
these dogs...

312
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,344
Kill two
for matching clogs.

313
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,013
See my vest.

314
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,890
See my vest.

315
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:44,563
Oh, please,
won't you see my vest

316
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,900
- I really like the vest.
- I gathered. Yeah.

317
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:51,195
He's going to make
a tuxedo out of our puppies.

318
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,656
Bart!

319
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,241
Sorry. You got
to admit, it's catchy.

320
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,826
Come on, Smithers.

321
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,953
Let's go finish
the little flea circuses off

322
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,956
except for "Little Monty,"
of course.

323
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,795
We got to get
the dogs out of there.

324
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,591
Hush, puppies!

325
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,176
We got to get
you out of here.

326
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,268
I know. The window.

327
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,354
No, Bart!
What are you doing?

328
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,623
Dogs always land
on their feet.

329
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,940
That's cats.

330
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,316
No. It's dogs.
I'll prove it.

331
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,239
Best two out of three.

332
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,449
Bart, look.

333
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,952
A laundry chute.

334
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,036
Okay, guys.
Let's move.

335
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,547
Come on. Come on.

336
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,630
I got an idea.

337
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,184
Sorry, Monty

338
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,395
but you're too big
for this ride.

339
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,945
- Quick!
- Let's get the...

340
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,405
Going somewhere?

341
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,656
That's impossible.

342
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,366
How did you get here first?

343
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,827
Oh, there'll be plenty of time
for explanations later.

344
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,913
Right now, I'll be taking
my puppies back.

345
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,165
But they're ours.

346
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,666
You stole them from us.

347
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,585
Here's a phone.

348
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,919
Call somebody who cares.

349
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,548
Now, if you'll excuse us,
children,

350
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:39,011
the pups have a date
with a fashion knife.

351
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,639
There. Now you don't know
which one's little Monty.

352
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,826
I guess if you don't want
him to be part of your tuxedo,

353
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,477
you have to let
the other dogs go, too.

354
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,478
Nice try.

355
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,189
Come on, Little Monty.

356
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,441
Stand up.

357
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,650
Come on. Stand up.

358
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,152
Do your trick.

359
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,653
- No. Don't.
- No.

360
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,006
- Stay down, Little Monty.
- Stay down.

361
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,310
- Don't get up.
- Stay down, boy.

362
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,534
Excellent.

363
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,251
Now, it's...

364
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,087
...simply a matter
of bending down

365
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,715
and picking up the one
and only...

366
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,677
This can't be happening.

367
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,262
They're all standing.

368
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,681
I can't tell them apart.

369
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,017
Well, all right, you win.

370
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,187
- I'll have to kill them all.
- No!

371
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,067
But they're
so wretchedly adorable.

372
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,653
25 little Rory Calhouns.

373
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,863
I can't do it...

374
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,115
But I can kill you.

375
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,536
No. I can't kill you either.

376
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,829
Look at you.

377
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,083
Standing there
on your hind legs

378
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,627
like a couple
of Rory Calhouns.

379
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,008
Well, Mr. Burns, I hope
you've realized the folly

380
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,092
of killing innocent
animals for fashion.

381
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,135
Oh, I have, I have!

382
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,428
I swear I'll never wear

383
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,930
any clothing
made from an animal...

384
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,724
...that can do an amusing trick.

385
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,311
Another victory for Montgomery
Burns's champion greyhound.

386
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,939
25 dogs, 25 world champions,

387
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,291
which, so far,
have earned their owner

388
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,693
over ten million dollars.

389
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,256
I'll bet whoever gave him those dogs
is kicking themselves now.

390
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,534
Homer!
For the love of God, no!

391
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:30,247
Marge, you know
that batting this light bulb

392
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,873
is the only thing
that cheers me up

393
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,127
after giving away those
million-dollar greyhounds.
