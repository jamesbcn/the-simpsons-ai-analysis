(DOORBELL RINGS)

347
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,888
I'm here for the (CLEARS
THROAT) yard sale.

348
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,325
But that was yesterday!

349
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,882
No. I mean the "yard sale."

350
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,405
What are you
talking about?

351
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,891
Can I buy some pills?

352
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,807
Well, maybe someone else can help
you but I am not a drug grocer!

353
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,042
(SIGHS) Oh!
(KNOCKING)

354
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,886
I'm out of drugs! See
how much money I made?

355
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,567
(GASPS)

356
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,361
Oh, Chief Wiggum. Uh, are you
still with the police department?

357
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,249
Save it, Ma Peddle.

358
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,720
Ma Peddle?

359
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,407
It's a reference to Ma Kettle, the
popular movie character from the '40s.

360
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,323
If you have to explain it,
it's not good, Chief.

361
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,084
HOMER: Well, boy,
you made the right choice.

362
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,926
I think this is the first step to a
new closer relationship between us.

363
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,527
Dad, I think you actually enjoy
seeing your own son suffer.

364
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,244
I don't enjoy it.

365
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,084
Being a father
is just a job.

366
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,924
Long hours, no pay.

367
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,846
And at the end, all you get is someone
yelling, “You screwed me up."

368
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,844
Well, maybe if you enjoyed me more,
I wouldn't be so screwed up.

369
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,527
Hey, I enjoy you plenty.
Talking time is over.

370
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,886
Mmm...

371
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,760
Don't worry,
Mr. Simpson.

372
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,366
We're gonna take his sass
and turn it into siss.

373
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,204
Thank you, Colonel.
I'm not a colonel.

374
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,931
This is a Boy Scout uniform
that I dolled up.

375
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,240
Come with me, son.

376
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,362
Now kiss your
childhood goodbye.

377
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,169
Whoo-hoo!
Vegas, here I come!

378
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,483
I miss you, Dad.
(GASPS)

379
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,246
Hey, Homer, you want
to eat my shorts?

380
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,566
(SHRIEKING)

381
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,726
(SCREAMS)

382
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,127
Don't gamble on
my love, Homer.

383
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,366
Oh.

384
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,884
Oh, I miss Bart. I can't leave
him in that awful camp.

385
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,363
I'm coming, boy!
(TIRES SCREECHING)

386
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,801
Oh, oh, great.

387
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,765
I'll get off here. Oh, no.

388
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,442
I bet this looks cool
from overhead though.

389
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,405
Oh, oh...

390
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,884
Whoo-hoo! Vegas, here I come!
Oh, right. Bart.

391
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,246
(TIRES SCREECHING)

392
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,765
(GRUNTING)

393
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,243
Nicely chopped, Simpson.

394
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,050
(GRUNTING)

395
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,926
Uh!

396
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,891
I've learned so much
in my three hours here.

397
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,167
I don't have to play
pranks to feel good.

398
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,484
I can just listen to the
gentle rhythms of nature.

399
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,125
(THUD)
HOMER: Stupid horse!

400
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,885
It's a "deer" crossing!
(TIRES SCREECHING)

401
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,928
Wipe the blood off the windshield
and get in the car, boy.

402
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,001
Dad?
Son,

403
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,051
I'm doing something I should've
done a long time ago.

404
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,804
Taking you to Vegas!

405
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,360
I'm gonna order a steak dinner
and eat it on the toilet!

406
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,044
And don't you try
to stop us!

407
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,208
Actually, we were gonna call you, Mr.
Simpson.

408
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,725
Your credit card
was declined.

409
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,928
Try this one!

410
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,244
MARGE: <i>Homer,
I hope you get this.</i>

411
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,449
<i>I'm in jail and I need
$10,000 bail.</i>

412
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,205
Hurry!
(BEEPS)

413
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,561
HOMER: <i>Ah, Marge, me
and Bart got in a fight</i>

414
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,331
<i>with this really
uncool pit boss,</i>

415
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,084
<i>and now we're in
Nevada State Prison.</i>

416
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,605
<i>Also, I don't know
where Bart is.</i>

417
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,330
<i>If you see him, say hey!</i>
(BEEPS)

418
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,126
(SIGHING)

419
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,089
Well, Maggie,
I always knew it would

420
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,640
someday boil down
to just you and me.

421
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,166
I'll look for work
in the morning.
