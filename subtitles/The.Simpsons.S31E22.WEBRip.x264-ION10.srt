1
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,635
Who wants popcorn...

2
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,705
to string
and put on the Christmas tree?

3
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,007
Ah, damn it.

4
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,080
Mom, I made an ornament
at Sunday school.

5
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,416
Oh, it's so...

6
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,385
sticky.

7
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,954
The Popsicle juice represents
Jesus's blood.

8
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:57,958
That would look so pretty
on the back of the tree.

9
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,061
Do not put on tree.

10
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,863
May occasionally do this:

11
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,998
Beep! Beep!

12
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,433
Beep!

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,036
Ooh, look! An old Santa hat.

14
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,071
You know who would love
to wear this?

15
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,272
No one.

16
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,107
The dog!

17
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,110
Quick! Lisa, take a picture.

18
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,613
I don't think he wants
to take a picture.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,682
Dogs... love...

20
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,250
people clothes.

21
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,792
Did you get a good picture?

22
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:32,960
I don't think so.

23
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,705
He's afraid of it.

24
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,940
No, he's not.

25
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,649
Darn, we wasted
three digital photos.

26
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,553
Well, suit yourself,
spoilsport.

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,355
You're out of the card!

28
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,357
Don't worry,
he's not out of the card.

29
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,892
- Can we be out of the card?
- Everyone's in the card!

30
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,395
Okay, but not like last year.

31
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,763
Ay, caramba!

32
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,832
<i>Ah, jingle bell, jingle bell</i>

33
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,567
<i>Jingle bell rock</i>

34
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,103
<i>Jingle bell rock
and jingle bell rock</i>

35
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,938
<i>A-rockin' and rockin'</i>

36
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,940
<i>And words of the song</i>

37
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,942
<i>Looks like I parked
on the lawn</i>

38
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,511
<i>Oh, giddyap, giddyap</i>

39
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,546
<i>Giddyap, let's go</i>

40
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,182
<i>There's mistletoe</i>

41
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,184
<i>There's kissin' to do</i>

42
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,054
<i>And lots to kiss.</i>

43
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:38,959
Marge, you're never
gonna guess what I got you.

44
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,066
It ate my shorts!

45
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,935
Oh, now that it's happened,
it's not so funny.

46
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,538
Homie, we have to talk
about the difference

47
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,275
between gifts
and household supplies.

48
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,479
Oh, my God!

49
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,914
What's all the fu...

50
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,416
What the...

51
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,185
That dog better have
a good explanation!

52
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,920
I did it.

53
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,422
Hit me with the newspaper.

54
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,424
You know I get my news online.

55
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,725
Guys...

56
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,561
what is
Santa's Little Helper doing?

57
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,497
I think something
is very wrong with him.

58
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:21,034
I think maybe we should take him
to a dog psychologist.

59
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,170
Dog psychologist, eh?

60
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,005
Get off the couch. Get off.

61
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,373
Get off!

62
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,843
Dad, I know
what you're thinking.

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,845
It's not that.

64
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:35,248
Elaine Wolff is giving
a free lecture tomorrow night.

65
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,917
She's a legend.

66
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,218
Oh, not tomorrow.

67
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,954
Tomorrow's UFC fight 243.

68
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,957
Why do you care so much
about one stupid fight?

69
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,359
'Cause he paid 60 bucks
to watch it.

70
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,929
60 bucks to watch a fight?

71
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,465
Actually, 70. I got it in HD.

72
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,900
We don't even have an HDTV.

73
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,969
I wanted
the pay-per-view operator

74
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,772
to think I was a big shot.

75
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,542
He's staring at that smudge...

76
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,344
smudge... smudge.

77
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,346
What's wrong with that dog...

78
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,081
dog... dog?

79
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,883
I need my pill...

80
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,418
pill... pill!

81
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,420
That's three pills!

82
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,499
I love playing Candy Crush.

83
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,202
Dad, I need to tell you
something,

84
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,204
but I've come
to the sad conclusion

85
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,241
that you have difficulty
hearing the female voice.

86
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,110
Aw, I love you too, honey.

87
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,547
Therefore, I have deputized Bart

88
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,349
to speak for me.

89
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,917
How you doin'?

90
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,953
Father, I believe
you're an honorable man.

91
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,588
Really?

92
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,190
Okay.

93
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,593
In times of peril, you...

94
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,095
even... event...

95
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,463
Eventually.

96
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,565
Eventually
do the right thing,

97
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,234
but Santa's Little Helper
is in crisis,

98
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,171
and eventually
may be too late.

99
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,039
Well said, boy.

100
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,376
And, Lisa, for writing it,
you win my highest honor,

101
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,345
a hearty Homer hug.

102
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,949
Now we party.

103
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,554
Why do you eat candy that way?

104
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,923
I already brushed my teeth.

105
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,199
Good evening.

106
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,936
The more I spend time
with dogs, the more I realize

107
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,339
that I entirely prefer them
to people.

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,008
No, no, I'm serious.

109
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,944
I really despise you.

110
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,947
Despise us? I...
Hey, as the owner of a dog,

111
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,116
a tiger and a dolphin,
I am highly offended.

112
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,551
Highly!

113
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,919
Okay, first of all,

114
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,755
I hate that you
call yourselves owners.

115
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,091
You own living beings?

116
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,960
Nice.

117
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,865
Hello?

118
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,868
Clayton, I can't talk right now.

119
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,169
I've left her.

120
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,404
I have left my wife.

121
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,906
What? Really?

122
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,042
You and I have loved each other
since primary school.

123
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,310
She knew that,

124
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,380
so I think she was relieved.

125
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,681
Oh, Clay.

126
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,251
I'd stopped allowing myself
to hope.

127
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,020
But... I think
I got to call you right back.

128
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,922
No, no! Stay on the call.

129
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,657
We're invested.

130
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,026
I have to go.
I'm giving a lecture.

131
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,227
Wait! Wait!

132
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,029
We're getting married, right?

133
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,597
Yeah, sure, sure,
yeah, whatever.

134
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,899
Wait!

135
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

136
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,869
You don't deserve dogs!

137
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,504
They sniff out your diseases

138
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,107
and comfort you
when you ride planes.

139
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:51,845
And I constantly hear,
how do I get my dog to listen?

140
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,414
- Choke him till he taps out!
- Oh, good God!

141
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,549
Always what can your dog
do for you.

142
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,119
Never once has somebody asked...

143
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:03,523
What is my dog trying to say?

144
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,725
Bad! Bad!

145
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,727
All of you, bad!

146
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,730
This was the worst extension
class I ever took. My God.

147
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,732
It was even worse
than flower arranging.

148
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,135
I mean, who can say
where baby's breath should go?

149
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,837
Not I.
Tell you that much.

150
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,838
Ma'am...

151
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,206
Down.

152
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,075
It's okay. We're friendly.

153
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,377
Ma'am, I know you were once

154
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,681
a young,
inquisitive girl like me.

155
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,915
Not like you, no.

156
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,717
I knew when to keep quiet.

157
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,520
Please.
My dog is having a breakdown.

158
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,723
So if these tears
mean nothing to you...

159
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,994
help our dog,
or let's do this!

160
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,229
Hold my pearls!

161
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,332
Look, I'm sorry,

162
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,533
I just can't d...

163
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,735
Oh, my.

164
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,372
You poor boy.

165
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,741
You've got a story to tell.

166
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,680
Could you teach us
to do what you do?

167
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,049
To see the world
through his eyes?

168
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,884
Oh, not through his eyes.

169
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,453
That's the point.

170
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,189
A dog's dominant sense is smell.

171
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,625
He sees the world with his nose,

172
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:16,696
and his nose sees so much more
than our eyes.

173
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:20,066
For instance, we see a lamppost.

174
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:25,005
Your dog sees everyone
who's ever been here.

175
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,192
He really likes you.

176
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,994
He adores me.
Knows I can help him.

177
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,662
Wants me to love him back.

178
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,064
But I can't.

179
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,134
A woman can only scoop
so much poop.

180
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,836
Stay.

181
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,338
Good stay.

182
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,050
Come on,
get to the part that helps us.

183
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,885
I'm trying.
In the acknowledgements,

184
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,355
she thanks all 101 dalmatians!

185
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,357
Well, at least
I can wash this filthy hat.

186
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,963
Bad dog! Very bad dog!

187
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,565
Crap dog!

188
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,036
Lisa, quick!
Get the first aid kit!

189
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,705
But we don't have
a first aid kit.

190
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,308
Look under the tree.

191
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,084
Well, if he's staying outside,
I'm staying outside.

192
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,052
You are not staying outside!

193
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,754
You are not the boss here!

194
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:51,057
Well, I am, and he paid me
to tell you what to do.

195
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,059
This boy is sleeping outside.

196
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,427
Yes, sir.

197
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,700
- What are we going to do?
- Aw, no problem, sweetie.

198
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,069
There are a lot of dog doctors
out there.

199
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,678
Hey. Hello.

200
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,680
Oh, look at this handsome guy.

201
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,348
What's up with you, fella?

202
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,450
He bit my mom.

203
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,052
Oh, I see.
Well, we've had a cancellation,

204
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,521
so if you like, we can
just put him down right now.

205
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,789
- What?!
- No!

206
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,125
I don't think
that's necessary.

207
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,393
Oh, no, I'm afraid
once a biter always a biter.

208
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,095
Unless you, like,
train 'em or something,

209
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,197
but that's... that's crazy hard.

210
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,099
Would you like a minute
to say goodbye?

211
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,901
No way. We're leaving.

212
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,937
And I don't even want
to look at you.

213
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,739
I feel like the Pixar logo.

214
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,376
What are we going to do
with the dog?

215
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,979
I guess he's just gonna
have to stay in the doghouse

216
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,448
I built for him.

217
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,987
Hey-a, kids. The vet reported
your dog as a biter,

218
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,223
so I'm supposed to wait
until animal control gets here

219
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,825
to take him away.

220
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,059
What?

221
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,061
So, well, while we wait,

222
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,197
you want to play Simon Says?

223
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,999
Simon says don't kill our dog.

224
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:08,034
I'm Simon.

225
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,202
You're not Simon.

226
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,739
Dad! They're coming for our dog!

227
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:17,076
I won't let you, you...
you big blue balloon.

228
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,346
Ooh, I like the image. Hey,
imagine me in a parade, huh?

229
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,915
Oh, boy.

230
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,352
Oh, darn it.

231
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,854
You call them and tell them

232
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,723
we are not letting you
take our dog.

233
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,892
I can't cancel.
They're already on the app.

234
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,028
It says they're
six minutes away. See?

235
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,431
Oh, they missed a turn.

236
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,966
Oh, now they're doing a U-ey.

237
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,570
Geez, hope this guy euthanizes
better than he drives.

238
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,071
Dad, quick, take our dog

239
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,040
and drive as far and fast
as you can.

240
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,575
Yes, sir.

241
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,778
Oh, God, it's too late.

242
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,780
Dr. Wolff?

243
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,882
Look, I need to tell you
this one thing.

244
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,717
Something I saw
in your dog's eyes.

245
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,953
He's at breaking point,
and unless he has

246
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,590
some kind of catharsis,
something terrible could happen.

247
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,991
He bit my mom.

248
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,626
It is gratifying to be right.

249
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,862
Oh, how awful.

250
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,699
Animal control is coming
to get him right now.

251
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:16,002
You can't stop them.
They got sticks with wire loops.

252
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,037
Kids, pack his things.

253
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,207
And I'll need this.
This dog is coming with me.

254
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,343
Well, I am not
leaving here empty-handed.

255
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,345
- Make me a sandwich.
- No.

256
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,713
Okay, all right.

257
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,948
Being a police chief
really sucks.

258
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,052
Here you go.

259
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,689
Listen, I packed you
some biscuits.

260
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,926
And even though I deplore
the killing of all animals,

261
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,062
when you come to the salami,
it's from me.

262
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,567
Now who will chase
squirrels with me?

263
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,540
You better get going.

264
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,143
Wait. I'm not
an emotional guy, but...

265
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,817
Get a doghouse, you two.

266
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:17,397
Here. Have some Snausage water
as you watch this video.

267
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,333
Here at the Institute,
there are no bad dogs.

268
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,335
In answer
to the age-old question...

269
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,872
Who's a good dog?
You are. You are.

270
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,374
Relax in our pile
of wet dead leaves

271
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,277
or enjoy fine dining
at The Dropped Porkchop.

272
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,947
And here's our guarantee
to you, no fireworks.

273
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,350
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.

274
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,019
Well, there's nothing
physically wrong with you,

275
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:43,356
but to establish trust,
I'll sleep in your den tonight.

276
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,963
Well, a little bit of
reading before bed?

277
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,641
Dog having nightmare,

278
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,078
perhaps about the root
of it all.

279
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,244
Oh, you poor thing.

280
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,314
Have some Lambien.
It'll help you sleep.

281
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,957
Dad, am I gonna get my dog back?

282
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,759
Of course.

283
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,095
But just in case, I know
this isn't the kind of thing

284
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:59,732
a father says to his son,
but let's pray.

285
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,469
Almighty patron saint of dogs,
Saint Bernard...

286
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:06,739
- Oh, can I join in?
- Sure.

287
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,041
I'll pray too.

288
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,511
Losing our dog,
possibly forever,

289
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,879
has really brought us together.

290
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,680
No!

291
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,482
Sorry, sorry.
Back to the prayer.

292
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,985
Okay, now I need to see
what set you off.

293
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:23,156
How do you feel about Marge?

294
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,938
She is comfort.

295
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,040
- So, what happened?
- Elaine?

296
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,075
Hello?

297
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,112
The car is here. Tuscany awaits.

298
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,114
Oh, Clay.

299
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,916
I should have called.

300
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,919
Darling, I've done
something impulsive.

301
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,055
You know how Mother always
wanted you to wear her ring,

302
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,292
but she died at a time
when we had no hope.

303
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,995
And in my heartache,
I let them bury her with it.

304
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:07,567
So I dug her up and
will you marry me?

305
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,735
I know exhumed

306
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,506
isn't usually
the most romantic word, but...

307
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:17,143
Oh, Clay. I can't marry you now.

308
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,412
But I can meet you in Tuscany
in a few weeks.

309
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,980
I might not be there.

310
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,916
I can't compete
with a wagging tail.

311
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,084
Goodbye, Clay.

312
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,855
I want you to know
I'm already over you.

313
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,891
Oh, no, no, not your fault.

314
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,227
Human nonsense.
Let's get back to work.

315
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,602
Today, I want you
to interact with the pack.

316
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,471
Mingle. Sniff a butt
you don't know.

317
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,349
Okay, interesting.

318
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,950
Let's explore that.

319
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,161
You buried this here. Why?

320
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,964
Is this the key
that unlocks your psyche?

321
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,966
Bark once for yes, bark twice

322
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,302
for that's too simplistic
a view of canine psychology.

323
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:21,674
Oh, hi. Is that our dog?

324
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,478
Or one that looks
just like it to fool the kids?

325
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,014
You're back!

326
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,016
Where did this come from?

327
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,419
I would have to say
the North Pole?

328
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,421
Wait, Dad?
That was the hat I was wearing

329
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,424
the night we got
Santa's Little Helper. Remember?

330
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,825
- Go! Go! Come on, boy!
- Go, Santa's Little Helper!

331
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,494
- Run! Run!
- Come on! Get that rabbit!

332
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,996
Dog of War coming up fast
on the outside...

333
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,933
Aw, can we keep him, Dad?
Please?

334
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,936
But he's a loser. He's pathetic.

335
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,938
He's...

336
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,006
a Simpson.

337
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,943
Santa's Little Helper
was a racing dog?

338
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,679
Not much of one.
Even I could beat him.

339
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,013
Oh, it's all clear now.

340
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,848
Your dog has PTSD.

341
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,650
And he has to confront
his abuser,

342
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,786
and he's gonna do it right now.

343
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,156
Actually, we're in the middle
of a holiday brunch, so...

344
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,024
But I'm with you.

345
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,060
Goodbye, everybody.

346
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,563
So, how many balls are
we allowed of croquembouche?

347
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,900
Let's see if they have HBO GO.

348
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,969
I've wanted to watch Euphoria,

349
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,304
but I'm embarrassed to have it
in my viewing history.

350
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,379
Les Moore? Greyhound trainer?

351
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,982
- Yeah, that's me.
- Dog abuser!

352
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,018
Can I offer you a drink
to throw in my face?

353
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,020
- Yeah, I'd like that.
- Yes, I bet you would.

354
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,989
I was being sarcastic,
naturally.

355
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,158
Not all trainers are monsters.

356
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,495
Yeah, I remember this mutt.
Santa's Little Helper.

357
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,497
Yeah! Hey,
what'd you rename him?

358
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,899
- We didn't.
- Boy, are you lazy.

359
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,902
He was born to one
of the fastest in the business,

360
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,903
She Biscuit.

361
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,905
Oh, he was her favorite.

362
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,274
And boy, did he love her.

363
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,176
That's how we learned
how fast he was.

364
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,113
So naturally, we took him
from his mother forever.

365
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,615
Did you just slap me again?

366
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,450
- That was me.
- You cut the line.

367
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,452
I want to slap.

368
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,722
Here, Maggie.

369
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,858
There. Now we've all had a turn.

370
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,393
Not quite.

371
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,728
Okay, I get it.

372
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,399
Boy, suddenly, the guy who
tortures dogs is the bad guy.

373
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,670
Now what does he want?

374
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,975
Son of a gun.

375
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,043
Where's he going?

376
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,979
To his... To his mother.

377
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,315
Oh, I love happy endings.

378
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:04,003
<i>Memories</i>

379
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,574
<i>Light the corners
of my mind...</i>

380
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,177
He'll be all right now.

381
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,179
Thank you so much.

382
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,181
Oh, you're welcome.

383
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,516
I better be getting home.

384
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,286
I've got 20 dogs to walk.

385
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,389
I could use some help.

386
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,759
Fine.

387
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:35,267
It's so great everyone in this
family worked out their issues.
