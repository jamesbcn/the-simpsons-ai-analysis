of the following atrocities:

synthesizing a laxative

63
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,865

Well, I'm sorry.

66
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,466
I'm sure Bart doesn't really
mean to be bad.

67
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,549
Now's our chance to be bad.
(chuckles)

68
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,096
TEACHER:
Mr. Simpson--

69
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,719
I just wanted
to tell you

70
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,055
that you've done
a wonderful job with Lisa.

71
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,101
You must have read to her
at a young age.

72
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,725
I did. I did read to her.

73
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980

75
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,123
Well, I've always been a firm
believer in the three R's:

76
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,159
reading <i>TV Guide,</i> um...

77
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,834
writing to <i>TV Guide,</i> and...

78
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,043

00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,792
Now, we don't usually do this

80
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,415
but we have some witnesses.

81
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,672
Come in, Arthur.

82
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:19,796
Now, where did Bart
stick the fireworks?

83
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,014
Oh!

84
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,104

97
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,423
We'd like the desk back,
Mr. Simpson.

98
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,540
Huh?

99
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,707

102
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,063
I really don't see
how this helps Bart.

103
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,274
Just do it.

104
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,613
Busted!

105
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,939
Homer, we have a problem here.

106
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,065
Are you kidding?

107
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,941
Lisa turned out perfect!

108
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,658
I won't stand here and listen
to you bad-mouthing Lisa.

109
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,159
We're talking about Bart.

110
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,870
Oh. That guy.

111
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,040
I think the problem
here is discipline.

112
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,659
If Bart does
something wrong

113
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,786
you should punish him.

114
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,752
Well, we try.

115
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,172
But he has this way
of making us think

116
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,630
we've punished him
when actually,

117
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,460
we've completely caved in.

118
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,205
He's the boy you love
to hate.

119
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,217
Well, you've got to start
being firm with him.

120
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,759
I believe,
with persistent discipline,

121
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,763
even the poorest student
can end up becoming

122
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,805
oh, say, chief justice
of the Supreme Court.

123
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,851
Chief justice
of the Supreme Court.

124
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,984
What great men he would join.

125
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,612

And what if we don't?

130
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,406

148
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,288
Eew!

149
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,708
Well, we brought some pizza.

150
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,086
(loud, rapid mumbling)

151
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,843
If you don't start
making more sense

152
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,085
we're gonna have
to put you in a home.

153
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,137
You already put me
in a home.

154
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,931
Then we'll put you
in the crooked home

155
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,604
-we saw on <i>60 Minutes.</i>
-I'll be good.

156
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,897
Look what your bad egg
of a son did to my teeth!

157
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,859
Dad, you and your stories.

158
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,319
"Bart broke my teeth.

159
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,529
"The nurses
are stealing my money.

160
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,699
This thing on my neck
is getting bigger."

161
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,238
Now this is exactly

162
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,951
what Bart's teacher
was talking about.

163
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,701
Our son did something wrong

164
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,373
and you look the other way.

165
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,832
But Marge, look at that
hangdog expression.

166
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,372
He's learned his lesson.

167
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,957
Let's get him a present.

168
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,921
Oh, please, Homer.

169
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,842
Why do I always
have to be the bad guy?

170
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,460
All right, all right.

171
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,337
Young man, since you broke
Grampa's teeth,

172
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,755
he gets to break yours.

173
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,013
Oh! This is going
to be sweet.

174
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,465
-No, no, no!
-Oh!

175
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,346
Bart, we're sending you
to bed without your supper.

176
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,644
Yeah, right, like you're
gonna let me go hungry.

177
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,768
I'll be eating that pizza
in five minutes.

178
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,315
Bart, stop being confident.

179

00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,199
I regret nothing!

354
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,329
(groans)

355
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,624
Someday you'll thank me
for this, son.

356
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,038
Not bloody likely.

357
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,536
No, it's true.

358
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,457
You know,
when I was a boy,

359
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,876
I really wanted
a catcher's mitt.

360
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,134
But my dad wouldn't get it
for me.

361
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,336
So I held my breath
until I passed out

362
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,467
and banged my head
on the coffee table.

363
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,064
The doctors thought
I might have brain damage.

364
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,180
Dad, what's the point
of this story?

365
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,687
I like stories.

366
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,649
Look, can I please go
to the movie?

367
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,979
I know my punishment
might seem a little harsh

368
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,685
but I can't go back on it.

369
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,485
You're welcome to watch
anything you want on TV.

370
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,029
TV sucks.

371
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,662
I know you're upset right now,

372
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,949
so I'll pretend
you didn't say that.

373
00:17:56,033 --> 00:18:00,003
MAN (on TV): <i>A master craftsman</i>
<i>can make three mailboxes an hour.</i>

374
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,709
I'm not licked yet.

375
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,539
I can entertain myself.
No matter how good a movie is,

376
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,085
it can't compare to
the imagination of a small boy.

377
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,018
(groaning)

378
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,020
-How was it?
-It wasn't that great.

379
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,193
-Be honest.
-It was the greatest movie

380
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,021
I've ever seen in my life!

381
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,567
And you wouldn't believe
the celebrities who did cameos--

382
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,441
Dustin Hoffman,
Michael Jackson.

383
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,318
Of course, they didn't use
their real names

384
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,074
but you could tell
it was them.

385
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,526
-Lisa...
-Sorry, Bart.

386
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,745
It's just not the same.

387
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,258
I've seen "The Itchy
& Scratchy Movie" 13 times.

388
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,628
I've seen it 17 times.

389
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,255
You guys must be getting
pretty tired

390
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,512
of that movie by now.

391
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,933
No one who saw the movie
would say that.

392
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,433
Let's get him.

393
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,715
(all yelling)

394
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,726
Homer, we'd like
to talk to you.

395
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,363
But then I won't
be watching TV.

396
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,069
You can see the bind I'm in.

397
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,440
Dad, you've got to let Bart
see that movie.

398
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,697
I've never seen him
like this.

399
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,278
He has the demented
melancholy

400
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,573
of a Tennessee Williams
heroine.

401
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,947
Don't you think
I know that?

402
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,793
Well, it's been two months.

403
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,999
You laid down the law
and I'm proud of you.

404
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,289
But I think
we've gotten through to him.

405
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,793
Sweet, soft-hearted Marge.

406
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,956
You just can't see
the big picture.

407
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,674
If I stick to my guns,
the boy could wind up

408
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,295
chief justice
of the Supreme Court.

409
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,303
If I fail,
the best he could do

410
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,465
is judge at
a Mr. Tight Buns competition.

411
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,885
I can't let that happen.

412
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,313
I won't let that happen,

413
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,981
and I can't let that happen.

414
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,976
One for <i>Itchy & Scratchy.</i>

415
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,198
We promised your dad
we wouldn't.

416
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,410
(groans)

417
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,012
I'm here at the Springfield
Aztec Theater

418
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,641
where, after eight months
and nine Academy Awards,

419
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,929
"The Itchy & Scratchy Movie"
is showing for the last time.

420
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,814
Tomorrow a new movie,

421
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,851
starring Liza Minnelli
and Mickey Rourke will open.

422
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,685
Will it be as successful?

423
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,060
Only time will tell.

424
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,566
Well, Dad, I guess you won.

425
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,689
No, son, we both won.

426
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,446
You don't know it now,
but I've started you on the road

427
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,488
to somewhere very special.

428
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,750
Well, I'll be.
"The Itchy & Scratchy Movie."

429
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,501
Come on,
what do you say?

430
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,633
All right. I think
you've learned your lesson.

431
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,221
One senior citizen

432
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,259
and one chief justice
of the Supreme Court.

433
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,393
Eh-eh-eh.
I'll get it, son.

434
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,510
That will be $650.

435
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:06,557
D'oh.

436
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,060
One soylent green.

437
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,181
Hold the butter.

438
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,938
