What the--

48
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,823
Selma, dear, I'm afraid
the children's reaction

49
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,446
is quite understandable.

50
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,333
You see, Bart here is
the shamus in short pants

51
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,490
who sent me
to prison.

52
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,908
That's right, Aunt Selma.

53
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,996
Your new boyfriend here
framed Krusty the Clown

I'd find out where he lives

58
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,296

Existence is suffering.

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,320
Two: The cause
of suffering is desire.

to do high-quality

00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,868
would be like kissing
some divine ashtray,

179
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,240
that's not what
I had in mind.

180
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,536
Selma, will you marry me?

181
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,581
(gasps)

182
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,794
Don't be a fool,
Aunt Selma.

183
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,174
That man is scum.

184
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,590
Then call me "Mrs. Scum."

Come on, Bart.

238
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,641
If Krusty can find it
in his heart to forgive him,

239
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,688
surely you can, too.

240
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,191
<i>Oh, Krusty,</i>
<i>I can't tell you</i>

241
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,193

<i>Ha-ha!</i>

243
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,901
Now, about your
wedding dress...

244
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,817
Mmm. I'm not sure
how to put this...

245
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,065
-White!
-White.

246
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,828
And what would you like
for appetizers?

247
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,409
Ooh, appetizers.

248
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,124
Well, Homer, you seem
to be a trencherman.

249
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,664
What should we serve?

250
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,958
Well, you can't go wrong
with cocktail weenies.

251
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,963
They taste as good
as they look,

252
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,295
and they come in this
delicious red sauce.

253
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,090
It looks like ketchup,
it tastes like ketchup,

254
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,715
but, brother,
it ain't ketchup!

255
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,472
Well, Selma,
he makes a good case.

256
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,684
Eh, get whatever you want.

257
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,894
It all tastes
like Styrofoam to me.

258
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,394
Selma, dear, I'm confused.

259
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,937
Well, when I was a kid,

260
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,560
we were playing
with bottle rockets,

261
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,977
and one shot
straight up my nose.

262
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,356
I permanently lost my sense
of taste and smell.

263
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:57,324
Okay, we've got cocktail weenies
and Swedish meatballs.

264
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,406
Selma, this wedding is
spinning out of control.

265
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,912
Can we really afford it?

266
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,793
I've already run through
eight of the ten dollars

267
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,330
they gave me
when I left prison.

268
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,583
Hey, relax.
I told you I got money.

269
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,626
I bought stock
in a mace company

270
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,629
just before
society crumbled.

271
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,921
Selma, that's wonderful!

272
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,295
I just hope people
don't think

273
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,342
I'm marrying you
for your money,

274
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,795
instead of your...
less tangible qualities.

275
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,257
(slurps)

276
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,057
Tomorrow we'll be
Mr. and Mrs. Bob Terwilliger.

277
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,392
Isn't it grand?

278
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,647
Hey, Bob, give some
of that honey this way.

279
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,440
Mmm...

280
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,895
Holy frijoles!

281
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,244
We've got ten minutes
till "MacGyver".

282
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,699
Driver, here's a fin.

283
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,909
Get me home,
and don't spare the whip.

284
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,068
Whatever you say, mum.

285
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,566
(belches)

286
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,658
(door slams)

287
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,742
What did I miss?

288
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,617
MacGyver was wearing
a tank top.

289
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,245
Dang.

290
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,791
Why, Selma, I thought I was
the only man in your life.

291
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,384
Sit down and shut up!

292
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,209
<i>MAN:</i>
<i>Thank you, Señor MacGyver,</i>

293
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,714
<i>you saved our village.</i>

294
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,206
<i>MACGYVER:</i>
<i>Don't thank me.</i>

295
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,757
<i>Thank the moon's</i>
<i>gravitational pull.</i>

296
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,217
That MacGyver's
a genius.

297
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,465
First of all,
he's not a genius.

298
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,978
He's an actor.

299
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,809
And second, he's
not much of an actor.

300
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,064
You're lying.
You're lying!

301
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,067
No, Selma, this is lying:

302
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,609
That was a well-plotted piece
of non-claptrap

303
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,153
that never made me
want to retch.

304
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,566
No!

305
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,864
(crying)

306
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,987
(Selma sobbing)

307
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,115
He was so cruel.

308
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,462
The things he said--

309
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,578
They're just not true.

310
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,455
There, there.

311
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,882
Oh, well, I guess
the wedding's off.

312
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,800
Fiddle-dee-dee.
Tomorrow's another day.

313
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,799
-Bart, stop that!
-No, he's right.

314
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,342
We're a package.

315
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,965
Love me, love "MacGyver".

316
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,722
I guess the wedding's off.

317
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,218
Selma, I don't know
what to say.

318
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,768
Just tell me
you like "MacGyver".

319
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,942
Very well. I...

320
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,861
I...

321
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,229
I can't do it!

322
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,106
Even that car chase
seemed tacked on.

323
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,993
(sobbing)

324
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,859
Oh, would you
two knock it off?

325
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,777
I hate all the programs
Marge likes,

326
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,116
but it's no big deal.

327
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,241
You know why?

328
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,237
-No.
-Go on.

329
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,578
Whenever Marge puts on

330
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:12,002
one of her nonviolent programs,
I take a walk.

331
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,212
I go to a bar, I pound a few,

332
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,343
then I stumble home
in the mood for love.

333
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,961
Very well, Selma.

334
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,378
Whenever you
watch "MacGyver,"

335
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,426
I'll take
a vigorous constitutional,

336
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,970
and return more in love
with you than ever.

337
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,684
Oh, Bob.

338
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,354
Bart no like.
Bad medicine.

339
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,023
(organ playing
"The Wedding March")

340
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,522
I could have been
the flower girl,

341
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,315
and I wouldn't keep
falling down either.

342
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,648
Hey, they chose Maggie,
okay?

343
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,534
Yeah, well, if you want
to go for cutesyness

344
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,701
instead of competence, fine.

345
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,910
Do you, Bob, take Selma,

346
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,370
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

347
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,952
till death
do you part?

348
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,959
(gruesome-voiced)
I do.

349
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,000
(gasps)

350
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,423
(playing generic lounge music)

351
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,882
Mmm.

352
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,842
Oh.

353
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,934
Hey, wiener boy.

354
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,888
Where do you think
you're going?

355
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,972
(munching and gobbling)

356
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm the only single girl
left in the family.

357
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,033
Well, I guess
it could be worse.

358
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,900
Oh, there's
Krusty the Clown.

359
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,527
Krusty! Krusty, say
something funny.

360
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,124
Oh, gee, a joke, huh?

361
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,119
Um... Uh... Funny...

362
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,332
Okay, this guy
walks into a bar

363
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,293
and takes out a tiny piano
and a 12-inch pianist...

364
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,464
Oh, no, wait.
I can't tell that one. Oh-ho!

365
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,464
Dear friends, 41 years ago,

366
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:46,387
God took 168 pounds of clay,
and he made me a woman,

367
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,678
and for this,
I thank him.

368
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,142
I just wanted to say,

369
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,062
on the advice
of my new husband,

370
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,232
I've decided
to give up smoking...

371
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,651
(cheering)

372
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,689
...except for after meals
and after "MacGyver".

373
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,983
Why, Selma, dear, you'll bury us all.
(chuckles)

374
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,279
Chief Wiggum,
you've been around.

375
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,322
You don't trust
sideshow Bob, do you?

376
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,276
Ah. Lighten up, son.

377
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,196
If he was going
to commit a crime,

378
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,155
would he have invited
the number-one cop in town?

379
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,116
Now, where did I put my gun?

380
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,456
Oh, yeah.

381
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,041
I set it down when I got
a piece of cake.

382
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,587
(cheering)

383
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,087
I don't know what to say.

384
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,804
Just tell me what you
know I want to hear.

385
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,095
I'm dying of jealousy.

386
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,600
Thank you.

387
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,351
(shouting farewells)

388
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,354
That's right, dear.

389
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,306
Enjoy your rest.

390
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,566
The wedding was
very tough on you,

391
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,029
and the honeymoon
is going to be...

392
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,779
murder.

393
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,701
(menacing laughter)

394
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,709
<i>Welcome to our</i>
<i>video honeymoon.</i>

395
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,587
<i>We're using the video camera</i>
<i>Cousin Doug gave us,</i>

396
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,585
<i>and the video cassette</i>
<i>Homer gave us.</i>

397
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,138
Hey, and after we watch this,
we can tape over it. (laughs)

398
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,353

399
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,725

00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,073
<i>Oh, Selma, dear.</i>

405
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,536
<i>I was just chatting with</i>

406
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,788

407
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,671

<i>I suppose so.</i>

415
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,481
MARGE:
Oh, that's sweet.

416
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,020
Why would Sideshow Bob
go so nuts over a fireplace?

417
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,225
Because he wants
his honeymoon

418
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,645
to be romantic.

419
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,904
Romantic? With Aunt Selma?

420
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,856
I guess you're just
too young to understand.

421
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,696
Hmm.

422
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,871
(Selma moaning)

423
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,912
Bob, one of my fillings
fell out.

424
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,918
Even murder
has its ugly side.

425
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,211
Bob, would you mind
rubbing my feet?

426
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,416
(shuddering groan)

427
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,046
Darling, you make it
sound like a chore.

428
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,390
Ooh... Oh...
Good... Mmm...

429
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,641
Soon I will kill you.

430
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,642
Huh?

431
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,973
<i>Son pieds sentit beau--</i>

432
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,808
French for
"Her foot smells lovely."

433
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,273
Oh.

434
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,982
Prepare to be murdered.

435
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,693
-Huh?
-(speaking Sanskrit)

436
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,324
That's... Sanskrit for
"Your toes are like perfume."

437
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,362
(laughs)

438
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,905
<i>-Voy a matar a usted.</i>
-Wha..?

439
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,159
That's Spanish for

440
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,530
"I am going to kill you."

441
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,867
Say what?

442
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,501
Why, dear,
I do believe it's time

443
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,038
for your beloved "MacGyver".

444
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,371
-(alarm beeps)
-Oh, hey, you're right.

445
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,259
(metallic squeaking)

446
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,553
-Well, time for my walk.
-Mm.

447
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,057
Don't forget to die.

448
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,769
Ding-dong.

449
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,729
I was feeling kind of
lonely without Selma.

450
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,901
Mind if I watch TV with you?

451
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,519
Oh, go ahead, Patty.

452
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,857
<i>Tonight, on "MacGyver"...</i>

453
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,203
<i>"MacGyver,"</i>
<i>"MacGyver," "MacGyver."</i>

454
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,489
Aunt Selma
has one hour to live.

455
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,743
HOMER:
Hey, down in front.

456
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,834
Goodbye.

457
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,083

458
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,337
(screaming)

459
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,626
Front desk, there's been
a terrible accident in my room!

460
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,085
(glass crunching)

461
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,023
Poor Selma.
You were having such a lovely evening

462
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,979

Sideshow Bob,

465
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,980
I'm afraid
the only victims here

466
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,436
are the good people
at Best Western hotels.

467
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,777
Bart!

468
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,743

469
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,912
Oh!

470
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,320
You tried to kill me.

471
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,078
I want a separation.

472
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,615

have room in your jail

474
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,917
for a two-time loser?

475
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,801
Well, no, frankly, but that never
stopped us before. Ha!

476
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,303
Bart, I must know,
how did you untangle my web?

477
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,763
Yeah, Bart, clue us in.

478
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,103
Well, I'd hate to tell
the number-one cop in town

479
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,599
how to do his job.

480
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,100
No, no, please, it's
the only way I'll learn.

481
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,603
All right.

482
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,944
<i>Sideshow Bob seemed</i>
