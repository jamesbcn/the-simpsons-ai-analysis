{\an8}Oh, I'd love to go
with you, honey,

30
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,225
{\an8}but I got a lot of work
to do around the bed.

31
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:44,599
{\an8}Homer, the Lord only asks
for an hour a week.

32
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,977
{\an8}In that case,

33
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,364
{\an8}he should've made
the week an hour longer.

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,610
{\an8}-Lousy God.
-(groaning)

35
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:53,072
{\an8}...and the very same
goes for Ezekiel.

36
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,664
{\an8}Which brings us back
to our starting point:

37
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,331
{\an8}The nine tenets
of constancy.

38
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,463

{\an8}MAN: Aw, for the love

43
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,301
{\an8}Our sermon today
is on constancy.

44
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,545
{\an8}In as much as the...

45
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,466
{\an8}moreover, by dint
of our application

46
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,636
{\an8}of these principles,
we can learn...

47
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,564
{\an8}...the auspices of constancy

48
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,364

-Yay!
-Oh, man!

53
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,407
Am I glad to get
out of there!

54
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,826
Hey, calm down--

55
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,714
you're wrinkling
your church clothes.

56
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,211
Who cares? This is
the best part of the week.

57
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,804
It's the longest possible time
before more church!

58
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,590
Church shouldn't be
a chore.

59
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,383
It should help you
in your daily life.

60
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,716
It should,
but it doesn't.

61
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,551
Now, who's going with Daddy
to the dump?

62
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,676
-BOTH: Me!
-The dump?

63
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,393
We're going to get rid
of the Christmas tree.

64
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,773
It's starting
to turn brown.

65
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,600
-Want to come with?
-No, no,

66
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,686
I don't feel like
going to a trash pile today.

67
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,151
It's your life.

68
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,231
We'll bring you back
something nice.

69
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,954
(humming)

70
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,237
Can you believe it?

71
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,124
They give you five Q's
and only two U's.

72
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,202
What a world.

73
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,996
It's crazy.

74
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,419
So, what's on
your mind, Marge?

75
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,708
Sermons about constancy
and prudissitude

76
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,592
are all very well and good,

77
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,089
but the church could be
doing so much more

78
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,052
to reach out to people.

79
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,012
Oh, I don't see you volunteering
to make things better.

80
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,603
Well...

81
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,678
Okay, I will volunteer.

82
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,675
I wasn't prepared for that.

83
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,019
(grunting)

84
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,935
Come on, Christmas tree...

85
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,106
(grunting)

86
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,492
(coughing)

87
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,662
Okay, who's up
for some scrounging?

88
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,996
Hey! Here's a perfectly good
basketball half!

89
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,843
I found a Malibu Stacy
with no head.

90
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,049
(screeching)

91
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,088

92
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,801
(laughing)

93
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,092

94
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,425
Oh, my God!
Help me, Lisa!

95
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,970
BART: Lisa, Dad--
come here quick!

96
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,724
There is something
that you won't believe!

97
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,978
What the heck is that?

98
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,810
{\an8}BART: Maybe it's a box
from the future.

99
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,975
{\an8}LISA:
It looks Japanese.

100
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,984
Wha-- What's going on?

101
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,317
Why-- Why am I on
a Japanese box?

102
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,914
(high-pitched whimpering)

103
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,579
Oh, my God...
what is that?

104
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,159
MARGE: All done!
I swept the aisles,

105
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,365
and put all the collection plates
in the dishwasher.

106
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,745
Oh, and you wouldn't
believe

107
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,962
how many dead pigeons
there were in the organ.

108
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,842
Marge, you are
a real time-saver.

109
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,209
Do you know,
thanks to you

110
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,876
I've rediscovered
a form of shame

111
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,884
that's gone unused
for 700 years?

112
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,216
Wow...

<i>What should I do?</i>

124
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,945
Well, maybe you should
read your Bible.

<i>Um, any particular passage?</i>

126
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,828

<i>All right.</i>
<i>Thanks anyway.</i>

128
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,924
Reverend, I hate to say this,
but it sounded

129
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,079
like that poor man
was reaching out to you.

130
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,878
I'm not sure your advice
was all that helpful.

131
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,262
(chuckling) Oh, Marge.

132
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,720
I was once idealistic
like you.

133
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,431
It was the mid '70s,

134
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,601
and I was fresh out
of seminary.

135
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,060
The '60s were long over

136
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,520
and people were
once again ready

137
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,270
to feel bad
about themselves.

I'm afraid something
terrible has happened.

Well, sit down and rap
with me, brother.

145
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,714
That's what I'm here for.

146
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,090
Well, I was talked into doing
a dance called "The Bump,"

147
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,088
but my hip slipped, and my--
my buttocks came into contact

148
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,552
with the buttocks
of another young man!

149
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,054
I... see.

150
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,886

00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,485
Really?
That's not what

176
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,662
Reverend Lovejoy's
been telling me.

177
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,700
Wow! You're good.
Thanks.

178
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,615
(ringing)

179
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,664
Hi. It's me again.
I got another problem.

180
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,707
Uh, this one's
about my cat.

181
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,631
(meowing)

182
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,040
Yeah! Shut up!!
I'm asking her.

183
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,222
Why would you volunteer
at the church?

184
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,431
I don't know. Guilt?

185
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,801
(scoffs) Volunteering
is for suckers.

186
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,678
Do you know that
so-called "volunteers"

187
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,644
don't even get paid?

188
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,595
Well, I think
volunteering is great.

189
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,435
Deep down,
it makes you feel...

190
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,360
Homer, will get that crazy box
off the dinner table?

191
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,730
It came from the dump.

192
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,686
But, Marge,
I'm obsessed with it.

193
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,276
Where did it come from?
What is it a box of?

194
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,572
How did my face get on it?

195
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,615
Hey, if they got
a picture of you,

196
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,409
that means they can see you.

197
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,333
They're probably watching us
right now.

198
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,581
That's ridiculous.

199
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,542
Nobody is watching us
right now.

200
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,465
Hai! Hai! Hai! Bye.

201
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,719
Hai!

202
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,260
Akira, can you
read this for me?

203
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,345
Ah, yes. This is a product
called "Mr. Sparkle."

204
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,521
Very popular dish detergent.

205
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,680
Hey...
he looks like you.

206
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,898
(laughs)

207
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,518
What's he saying?

208
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,775
He identifies himself as
"a magnet for foodstuffs."

209
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,738
He boasts that he will
"banish dirt

210
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,648
to the land of wind
and ghosts."

211
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,067
Wow!

212
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,655
Yes. You have very lucky dishes,
Mr. Simpson.

213
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,661
This soap is from the
sacred forest of Hokkaido,

214
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,294
renowned for its countless
soap factories.

215
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,422
Hokkaido, eh?

216
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,674
See, all along,
I been telling Carl

217
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,463
I'm married to
a beauty queen.

218
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,377
Now, he's coming
over for dinner.

219
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,675
Lenny, I'm sure
he'll like your wife

220
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,388
no matter what she looks like.

221
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,098
Oh, no, no. No.
It's worse than that.

222
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,598
I don't even have a wife.

223
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,850
I just said I did to,
you know, be a big-shot.

224
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,943
Oh. Well, it's time
to start telling the truth.

225
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,150
Now, when I have to tell
my husband the truth,

226
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,151
I cook him a big,
delicious dinner.

227
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,744
By the time
he's done eating

228
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,279
he's too full and tired
to care what I have to say.

229
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,703
Wow, that's great!

230
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,241
When Carl comes over,
I'll stuff him

231
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,244
till he don't know
what's what.

232
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,293
Seymour, I'm getting tired.

233
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,712
Tell them we're going next.

234
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,330
Well, I'm not principal
of the line, Mother.

235
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,088
And you never will be.

236
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,888
I'd like the phone book
for Hokkaido, Japan, please.

237
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,929
Okay.
Here you go.

238
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,473
The phone book
for Hokkaido, Japan.

239
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,726
Thank you.
May I please use your phone?

240
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,518
Is it a local call?

241
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,152
Y... yes.

242
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:16,532
(touch tones)

243
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,397
(phone ringing)

244
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,810
{\an8}Mooshi-mooshi?

245
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,938
Yes. This is Homer Simpson
from America.

246
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,646
Who may I say
is speaking to me?

247
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,986
{\an8}(speaking Japanese)

248
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,412
Hello, chief?
Let's talk, why not?

249
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,581
Uh, hello?
Why am I Mr. Sparkle?

250
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,161
Oh, you like Mr. Sparkle?

251
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,155
Well, I am Mr. Sparkle.

252
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,957
Oh, you have
many question, Mr. Sparkle.

253
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,501
I send you premium answer question
hundred percent.

254
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,296
The Lord will hear
your lamentations

255
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,511
and give solace to your spirit.

256
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,931
The Lord or Marge Simpson!

257
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,049
LENNY:
Amen to that.

258
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,595
(all exclaiming)

259
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,520
Um... could we please
not yell out things

260
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,349
in the church?

261
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,314
(bell ringing)

262
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,359
(overlapping dialog)

263
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,781
Wait a minute, please.
One at a time.

264
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,950
One at a time!

265
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,488
Now, who has
the most urgent problem?

266
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,782
I have a recurring dream
in which I'm falling.

267
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,657
Come right this way,
Mel, I--

268
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,584
Tim, hold my calls.

269
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,875
Mm...

270
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,091
I'm a shepherd
without a flock.

271
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,512
What have I done
to lose them?

272
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,467
<i>The real question is</i>

273
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,184
<i>"what have you done</i>
<i>to keep them?"</i>

274
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,224
(gasps)

275
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,096
St. Eleutherius of Nicomedia.

276
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,983
<i>That's my name,</i>
<i>don't wear it out.</i>

277
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,150
<i>To inspire men,</i>
<i>you must be brave.</i>

278
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,069
<i>I introduced Christianity </i>
<i>to Mongolia.</i>

279
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,069
<i>It didn't take,</i>
<i>but it was worth a try.</i>

280
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,071
<i>Tell us, good reverend,</i>

281
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,743
<i>what great deeds</i>
<i>have you done</i>

282
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,491
<i>to inspire</i>
<i>the hearts of men?</i>

283
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:25,123
Well, I had the vestibule
re-carpeted.

284
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,042
<i>I've appeared</i>
<i>in over 8,000 visions</i>

285
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,961
<i>and that's the lamest reply</i>
<i>I've ever heard.</i>

286
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,580
Oh, now, please, I--

287
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,037
I thought saints
were supposed to be friendly.

288
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,798
<i>Oh, you're just lucky</i>
<i>God isn't here.</i>

289
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,352
(phone ringing)

290
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,719
Hello. Listen Lady.

291
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,055
Marge, people say
you've got a real knack

292
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,891
for solving problems.

293
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,766
Well... this is
a little awkward

294
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,983
but, um, Tim came home
from church

295
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,773
so despondent today,

296
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,777
he's just been playing with
his trains all afternoon.

297
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,990
We all need a little time
to ourselves, Helen.

298
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,780
Just give him a day or two

299
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,744
and I'm sure he'll be back
to his old dynamic self.

300
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,325
Okay.

301
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:11,043
Attention,
H-O scale passengers:

302
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,673
The dining car is closed.

303
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,671
Root beer is still available,

304
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,673
but the cost is now $6.50.

305
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,296
If the passengers
will look to the right

306
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,303
you will see a sad man.

307
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,176
That is all.

308
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,523
Look, we got a package

309
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,849
from the Mr. Sparkle
company in Japan.

310
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,845
Ooh!

311
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,015
Ow!

312
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,857
It's a videotape.

313
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,993
Put it in! Put it in!

314
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:50,663
<i>Oh, hello,</i>

315
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,166

That didn't
explain anything.

338
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,084
All I know is
they stole my face

339
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,711
and used it
for their stupid logo.

340
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,538
There's no other explanation.

341
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,884
Wait, look.

00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,288

<i>a joint venture</i>
<i>of Matsumura Fishworks,</i>

<i>and Tamaribuchi</i>
<i>Heavy Manufacturing Concern.</i>

345
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,269
Hey, it was all
a coincidence.

346
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,559
Yep. There's your answer,
fish bulb.

347
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,103
Well, it was a good

00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,148
Come on, kids,
let's go home.

349
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,191
We are home.

350
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,944
That was fast.

00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:48,656
You've just got to accept it.
Your Gameboy is gone.

Aye, aye.

00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,794
Aye.

Hello. Listen Lady.

357
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,129
Uh... I'm in some
hot soup here, Marge.

358
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,382
Some teenagers are hanging out
in front of the store.

359
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,344
I-I think they could start
slacking at any moment.

360
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,675
Well, Ned, you don't have
to stand for that.

361

right up to those youngsters

362
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,143

00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,723
Yeah, well...

Hey, let's go over
to the one-hour photo

366
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,939

367
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,322
Uh, excuse me, fellas.

368
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,359

it might be nice

369

375

They crave it!

379
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,761

They're on their mini-bikes

Oh, all right,

Morning, Marge.

391
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,997
Um, did your husband
come home last night?

392
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,042
Of course he did.

Reverend, I gave Ned Flanders
some bad advice.

in real trouble.

What happened now?

402
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,442
Did he swallow a paper clip?

403
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,487
No. He's disappeared.

404
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,071
Oh, I'm in way over my head.

405
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,527
