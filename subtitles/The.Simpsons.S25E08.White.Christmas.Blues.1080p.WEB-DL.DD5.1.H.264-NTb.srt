00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:13,284
(listless): Hey-hey.
Due to modern sensitivity,

20
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:15,612
we've been asked to block
any violent images

21
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:17,439
that appear in this
children's cartoon.

22
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,388
Oh, my God!

23
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:21,867
I never watched
one of these sober!

24
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:25,766
I gotta get this bloodbath
off my kids' show!

25
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:26,783

00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:31,207
KRUSTY:
<i>Damn it!</i>

27
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:33,661
Aw, geez, when did
everything turn to crap?

28
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:36,862
Bart, don't use
language like that.

29
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,924
MARGE: <i>Man, things sure
have turned to crap.</i>

30
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:42,321
- (Homer humming)
- Homer,

31
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:44,746
you have to take the
Halloween decorations down

32
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:46,941
before you put the
Christmas ones up.

33
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,961
Marge, to that I
say, boo, humbug.

34
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:53,299
(hissing)

35
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:59,572
There's a new Grinch
this holiday season,

36
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,873
and its name
is "global warming."

37
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:04,701
Meteorologists warn there'll be
no snow this Christmas

38
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:07,162
anywhere in America,
not even in Alaska,

39
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:10,927
where the Eskimos now have
a hundred words for "nothing."

40
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,332
Global warming. Huh.

41
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:15,630
By pure coincidence, every
scientist was right.

42
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,562
But it's not all doom and gloom.

43
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:20,181
Illegal poachers are
having a field day.

44
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:22,604

50

(Marge sighs)

51
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,924
Sorry, kids, I guess the hats and mittens
will have to wait until next year.

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,403
- Oh!
- Oh!

53
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:56,326
(humming)

54
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:01,477
Hmm?

55
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,759
Snow?

56
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,264
(laughs)

57
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:05,679
Snow!

58
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:06,999
(both gasp)

59
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:09,760
Oh, you know what
this means, kids?

60
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:10,573
(both gasp)

61
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:13,737
I don't have to pick
up the dog poops!

62
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:16,617
(sobbing)

63
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,036
Uh, so you see, the "snow"
is a microclimate aberration

64
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:25,498
caused by radioactive steam
from the nuclear plant

65
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:28,192
and, of course, tire
fire particulate.

66
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:31,443
So, we're the only place
in America with snow,

67
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,264
if you can call it that.
I guess you can.

68
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:37,747
Don't you idiots see
what this means?!

69
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:39,996
Idiots? Why do we
reelect this guy?

70
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,676
'Cause his opponent has
a long Slavic name.

71
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,096
(crowd grumbling)

72
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:46,099
Who want bumper sticker?

73
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:51,896
People, Springfield is now the only town
in America that has snow this Christmas.

74
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:54,701
So tourists are going
to want to come here.

75
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:57,926
- Stay in our hotels!
- Slurp our spaghetti.

76
00:04:57,957 --> 00:05:00,745
Die in our hospitals.
(chuckles)

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,203
I say we welcome our winter
tourists with open arms,

78
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:05,940
then gouge the hell out of 'em!

79
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,360
Who? Who will gouge with me?

80
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,012
I, too, will gouge!

81
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:14,530
Duff Beer is proud to make a
corporate commitment to gouging!

82
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:16,106
(cheering)

83
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:24,088
Here come the tourists.

84
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,020
Man your ATMs. Yar.

85
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:30,232
(both chuckle)

86
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,391
(belches)

87
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,890
Why would a robot need mittens?

88
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:45,054
Why would a little
boy need an aspirin?

89
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:46,713
I don't know. (grunts)

90
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:49,700
The one thing Bongo
Comics are good for.

91
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:56,161
(groans)
Are you okay, Chief?

92
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:57,763
(panicky): I'll be fine,
I'll be fine.

93
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,242
God, I bent down to pick up a piece
of candy and rolled down a hill.

94
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:04,909
You always think it's the other guy
that'll turn into a giant snowball.

95
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,089
Never you.

96
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,795
- Have you seen Lou?
LOU: There's snow in my lungs!

97
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,296
Lot of attitude in that hand, Lou.
Lot of attitude.

98
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:15,015
(horns honking, Marge groans)

99
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,859
Look at all these
out-of-state license plates.

100
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:21,014
"First in Freeways,"
"The 'Yuh-Huh' State,"

101
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:24,656
"Jewel of the Fracking Belt"?
"Still a British Colony at Heart,"

102
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:26,416
"Land of Many Water Snakes"?

103
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,924
(Marge groaning)

104
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:29,985
Valet parking, five dollars.

105
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:32,423
(tires screeching, horn honks)

106
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:33,924
Oh...

107
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:37,978
(gasps)

108
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:40,616
People, I'm completely
out of milk!

109
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,549
I do have several DVDs
of the movie <i>Milk,</i>

110
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,081
an inspiring return to form
for director Gus Van Sant.

111
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,253
Uh, do you have <i>Life of Pi?</i>

112
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:53,729
No, but I have some home movies
of me on a canoe with a big dog.

113
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,841
People who have never seen
a movie say it is a good movie.

114
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:07,451
Mmm?

115
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,012
(sighs)

116
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,393
We can't afford Christmas.

117
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:16,276
And when you can't afford Christmas,
you've failed as a family.

118
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,767
(voice breaks): That's what
all the big stores say.

119
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:23,006
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm
so sorry to bother you,

120
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:25,936
but my kids are exhausted
and the town is sold out.

121
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,115
Is there any chance you'd
have a spare room for us?

122
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,420
Well, there's a rec room
off the kitchen,

123
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:34,178
but sometimes it's there
and sometimes it isn't.

124
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:36,865
Our house is very odd that way.

125
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,749
Please? Please, ma'am?
We'd pay you $300 a night.

126
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:42,789
Well, you seem like a
nice, pushy stranger.

127
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:46,284
Ma'am, because we talk this way,
people always think that we're, um...

128
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,935
- Uh, what is that word, honey?
- Passive-aggressive.

129
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,280
Right, right, but we're not.

130
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,772
Please, please take our
money and everybody wins.

131
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:59,878
(Homer humming)

132
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:05,931
Hmm? Oh, good. Marge
remarried after I died.

133
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:08,662
Wait a minute. I'm not dead.
What's going on?!

134
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:10,607
These are our new boarders.

135
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,029
Uh-uh. No way. I'm not sharing
my bed with anybody except you.

136
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,098
And maybe that guy.
Lincoln-style. But that's it.

137
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,075
This is a great thing.

138
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:22,091
We're helping people
celebrate Christmas,

139
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:24,497
and we'll be able
to afford Christmas.

140
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,083
Oh, I don't know. It won't
seem like Christmas

141
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:30,356
without opening up a giant
credit card bill in January.

142
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,114
Take a look at this.

143
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,940
HOMER:
What the...?

144
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:37,081
"The Simpson Bed and Breakfast"?
(chuckles)

145
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:39,803
I always wanted to stay
in a place like this.

146
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,895
But Christmas is a special time.

147
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:45,934
And I like to spend it in the warm
embrace of watching football.

148
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:50,166
Homer Simpson, ask
yourself, W.W.B.J.D.?

149
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,605
- Huh?
- What would Baby Jesus do?

150
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:55,905
(The Beach Boys'
"Merry Christmas, Baby" begins)

151
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:59,704
♪ My baby she told me she
don't want to hold me ♪

Well, this crazy scheme is
the kind of impulsive behavior

164
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,688
I want to encourage in you.

165
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:34,849
Mmm...

00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,657
I'm in! 100%!

167
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:38,148
Oh, thank you.

168
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,190
Now, Homie, table three
needs more bread.

169
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,083
- I'm on a break.
- D'oh!

00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,933
Welcome to our day care center.

173
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,849
All girls, please move
to cootie quarantine.

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,690
We've got a two-month-old.

175
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:26,409
Are you sure
you can handle her?

176
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:28,290
Just don't lose
this claim ticket.

177
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,391
That church doesn't
look very inspiring.

178
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,305
What a bland marquee.

179
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,472
It doesn't look very inviting.
(indistinct chatter)

180
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,217
This whole crowd's gonna
be at my sermon today.

181
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:41,190
Darling, did St. Paul
worry about the crowds?

182
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,940
Oh, he wrote letters.
Any fool can write letters.

183
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,209
(sighs)

184
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:53,328
Lord, I'm just
a small-town minister.

185
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,187
We don't have Mormon money.

186
00:10:55,194 --> 00:11:00,690
But if you could see your way to guiding
my fingers as I type this sermon...

187
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,163
Oh, yeah.

188
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:08,718
Oh, this is black-church good.

189
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,380
My friends...
(feedback drones, congregation groaning)

190
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,348
When he starts with "my
friends," it's always bad.

191
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:25,598
Friends, every year, I tell you this
holiday is about the birth of our Lord,

192
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:29,002
not singing Santas
and full stockings.

193
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:30,780
(all murmuring)

194
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:32,010
You're losing us!

195
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:37,433
Christmas is not about what happened
in a manger some 2,000 years ago.

196
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:40,394
It is about what you
do for others now.

197
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:41,748
Oh!
(all murmuring)

198
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:46,253
Get my the church bulletin.
Lovejoy's on fire.

199
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:49,683
Christmas is the Holy Spirit.

200
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,555
Ooh, I didn't know there
were doves in there.

201
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,754
Give with your hearts!
Give with your acts!

202
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:00,084
And you will know the true
meaning of Christmas.

203
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,428
(congregation gasping)

204
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:05,639
(oohing and aahing)

205
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,182
Wow, what a showman.

206
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:10,384
(cheering, whooping)

207
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:14,101
I haven't felt this inspired since
the blueberries at breakfast.

208
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:16,780
Daddy, permission
for a religious fit?

209
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:17,694
A brief one.

210
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:19,412
(speaking in tongues)

211
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,376
I said a fit, not a fervor.

212
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,812
That sermon really inspired me.

213
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:26,028
This whole Christmas
has been about money.

214
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:27,864
(bell jingling)

215
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,179
- Oh, are you with the Salvation Army?
- What makes you think that?

216
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:32,304
(clink)

217
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:33,281
Bless you.

218
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:37,163
But I'm gonna give gifts that aren't
expensive and come from the heart.

219
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,621
I don't know.

220
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,960
Christmas didn't get to be the number
one holiday by being about love.

221
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:46,961
Um, when a woman talks,
she just wants to be heard.

222
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:48,315
(groans)

223
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,279
(groans)
Where's the end?

224
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,577
(gasps, groans)

225
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:59,021
Hey, Marge, we're running
out of chestnuts over here.

226
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:02,085
- Well, they don't grow on trees.
- Uh, yeah, they do.

227
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:02,994
Oh.

228
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:06,182
What about our romantic
carriage ride through the snow?

229
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:08,244
Setting it up.

230
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:15,355
I don't think you're giving them
what they were promised, Dad.

231
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:19,122
The secret is: Don't
read the comment cards.

232
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:24,802
Where do the people sit?

233
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:26,631
I thought they were
just gonna watch me.

234
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:29,060
Excuse me. This
eggnog is terrible.

235
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:31,146
All eggnog is terrible.

236
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:34,722
Those stockings are not hung
by the chimney with care.

237
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:39,102
Why did I do this for money?
Why did I do this for money?

238
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:43,125
And the Christmas special on your
television is one of the worst.

239
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:46,947
ANNOUNCER: We now return to <i>King
Winter Feasts On His Children.</i>

240
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:50,138
By the time Princess Summer
comes to save you,

241
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:52,904
you'll all be blood in my beard.

242
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:54,278
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

243
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,137
Your own father's beard.

244
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:57,699
(King Winter cackling)

245
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,314
How long to see Santa?

246
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:06,880
How would I know?
I'm an accountant.

247
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,002
I imagine for small
business, huh?

248
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:10,744
God, I hate Christmas.

249
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:12,753
Huh?

250
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,232
Mr. Flanders,
where's your store?

251
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:18,318
Well, I'm down to a kiosk,
thanks to that place.

252
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:21,984
Actually, half a kiosk.

253
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,891
Sharing it with Nasreen here.

254
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:27,326
No cream is finer than
mall kiosk cream.

255
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:29,716
- J.Lo use it.
- No, thanks.

256
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:32,285
It is no wonder
you are not married.

257
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:33,512
Flip me back.

258
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:39,810
If I have to give presents, I'll
give presents with a purpose.

259
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,005
One for Maggie. Check.

260
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,796
All that's left is Bart.

261
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:47,875
No. No. No.

262
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:49,145
No, no, no...

263
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:51,571
Ah, perfect.

264
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,785
GUESTS:
♪ All from Satan's power

265
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:59,254
♪ As we were gone astray

266
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:01,807
♪ Oh, tidings

blessed babe was born... ♪

269
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,269
Enough. Stop.

270
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:14,964
Christmas carols
only have one verse.

271
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:16,795
Well, they may have more,
but the second verse

272
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:18,889
is where they get
all weird and religiousy.

273
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,463
Uh, more wassail, please.

274
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:22,754
And don't skimp on
the aromatic bitters.

275
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:28,102
For your information, Gloria, my wassail
is just Gatorade I put in the microwave.

276
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:28,847
(both gasp)

277
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:30,736
I drank that under
the mistletoe.

278
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:33,658
It's not mistletoe, just
cherries and lettuce.

279
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,565
BOTH: Oh!

280
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:37,121
I thought when I ate it,
it wasn't poisonous.

281
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:39,260
I've opened up my house to you

282
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:42,963
and all you do is fill this joyous
season with petty complaints.

283
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:44,876
Ho, ho, ho.

284
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:48,934
Not now. Take out that pillow
and put it in room three.

285
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,000
(sighs)

286
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:52,277
The pillow acted as a girdle.

287
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:53,847
Any more questions?

288
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:55,920
Uh, yes, will the
pudding be figgy?

289
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,488
- The pudding will be Jell-O.
- Quite so.

290
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,882
I'm going to sulk in my room.

291
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,796
The only thing good about
this place is the piano player.

292
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:06,616
(coins rattle)

293
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,741

295
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:25,551
An Angelica Button wizard robe.

296
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,748
With wand pocket.

297
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:29,728
And wand.

298

(gasps)
Professor Digglesby's wand.

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,162
Now I have every wizarding stick

300
00:16:34,185 --> 00:16:37,865
from the Spells and Potions
Department of Wagglepoofs Academy.

301
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,239
Don't make me learn about it.

302
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,863
I know this Christmas has been a
little rocky, even for the Simpsons,

303
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:45,979
but I think these gifts
born of thought and love

304
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:49,290
will restore the balance
of prajna and samsara.

305
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:52,302
I mean holly and jolly.

306
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:55,114
Now, Dad, I'd like to
give you your present.

307

- You got me weed?
- Even better.

308
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,741
They're bags of seeds.

309
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:03,554
So that you can plant a
garden and watch it grow.

310
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:05,363
That's great, sweetie.

311
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:08,543
After all that time and
hard work, I'll have...

312
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:09,777
radishes?!

313
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:13,902
It's the most hated part of salad, which
is the most hated part of dinner.

314
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,986
Radishes, nothing but radishes.

315
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:21,251
Dad, stop.

316
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,728
What? I'm saving them
from the struggle of life.

317
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:26,055
Well, at least you're
eating vegetables.

318
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,502
Vegetables?!

319
00:17:28,393 --> 00:17:30,308
Okay, Bart, open your present.

00:17:30,323 --> 00:17:32,206
It's the one I'm
most excited about.

you're smart.

Why would you give <i>me</i> a book?

324
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,942
- 'Cause it's easy to wrap?
- Nothing is easy to wrap.

us a happy Christmas.

Stop it! Stop it!

336
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,457
Why in the world would
you burn a book?

337
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,684
Actually, the idea to do
this came from a book.

338
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:19,113
<i>Fahrenheit 451</i> by Ray Bradbury?

339
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:22,091
What? No, I got it from this.

340
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,776
MILHOUSE:
See?

341
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:26,865
How could you burn the
present I gave you?

342
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:28,342
Because it's <i>my</i> present.

343
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,452
Did you give it to me because
you thought I'd like it

344
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:33,374
or because <i>you</i> wanted to
feel better about yourself?

345
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,797
Children, perhaps it's time that I
explain the true meaning of Christmas.

346
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,371
- HOMER: Shut up, Flanders.
- Okily-dokily.

00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,384
Now, did you check the room to make
sure you haven't left anything?

348
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:46,511
- All set. - Need directions
or a bottle of water?

349
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,356
No, thanks. We're fine.

350
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,538
Thank you, sir.

351
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,390
(clears throat)

352
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:54,783
Oh, right, we're
still doing that.

353
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:57,020
Come on. I'll drive
you to the airport.

354
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,062
Where are my keys?
Oh, right in here.

355
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,960
Bart, you were right.

356
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,155
If you smell your farts
in a dream, you die?

357
00:19:03,182 --> 00:19:05,420
No, about Christmas.

358
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:08,648
So I went out this morning
and I got you this.

359
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:10,747
It's a tablet with books on it,

360
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:14,250
but also apps, like
Worms With Friends.

361
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:15,876
(muffled grumbling)

362
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,772
Wow. But how'd you afford it?

363
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,155
I sold the gift you gave me.

364
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,191
- Get the twist?
- Obviously.

365
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,373
You're saying it's from Maggie,
but actually it's from you.

366
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,639
Thanks, Lis.

367
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:32,569
Now, why don't you donate that to
whatever hopeless cause you want.

368
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,244
Thanks, Bart. This will make a
lot of arctic loons very happy.

369
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:38,394
(Marge groans)

370
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:43,011
Uh, listen, I just wanted to
say I'm sorry I overreacted.

371
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:44,830
Thank you all for coming.

372
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:47,412
Yeah, well, we have something
to say to you, Marge.

373
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,164
