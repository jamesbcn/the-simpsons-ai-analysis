in this house

38
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,799
{\an8}we use a little

39
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,589
{\an8}It's the coolest
video game ever.

40

{\an8}I'm sorry, honey

41
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,304
{\an8}but those games cost
up to and including $70.

42
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,716
{\an8}And they're violent and they
distract you from your schoolwork.

43
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,345
{\an8}Those are all good points,
but the problem is

131
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,298
I'm outside.

132
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,513

your coat, please?

135
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,227

00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,962
This is Detective Don Brodka

177
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,171
from Try-N-Save security.

178
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,421
That's right, Don Brodka.

179
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,964
Your son Bart has been
caught shoplifting.

180
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,298
Uh-huh.

181
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,842
Yeah, it's a shame,
I know, but, well...

182
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,798
try and have
a merry Christmas.

183
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,428
They weren't home. Uh-huh.

184
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,975
But I left a message on
their answering machine.

185
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,099
That's right.

186
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,385
Um, okay.

187
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,188
I've really, really,
learned my lesson.

188
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,481
Can I please go now?

189
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,824
Yeah, get out
of my sight.

190
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,070
Hey, kid.

191
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,821
One more thing.

192
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,073
If you ever set foot
in this store again

193
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,865
you'll be spending Christmas
in Juvenile Hall.

194
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,870
Capice?

195
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,909
Well, do you understand?

196
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,825
Everything except capice.

197
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,303
Lousy stinking piece of crap.

198
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,092
Got to change
that answering machine tape.

199
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,585
Oh God, I got
to change that tape!

200
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,764
Got to change Maggie.

201
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,386
Dear God, we got
to change Maggie!

202
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,530
Hmm, we didn't have a message
when we left.

203
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,068
How very odd.

204
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,441
<i>♪ Hello, muddah ♪</i>

205
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,068
<i>♪ Hello, faddah ♪</i>

206
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,485
<i>♪ Here I am at</i>
<i>Camp Granada... ♪</i>

207
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,076
Marge, is Lisa
at Camp Granada?

208
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,082
(chuckling)

209
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,584
Now to put this tape

210
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,916
where no one
will ever listen to it.

211
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,962
Homer, didn't
you get any milk?

212
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,417
All I see is egg nog.

213
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,127
'Tis the season,
Marge.

214
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,757
We only get 30
sweet, noggy days

215
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,465
then the government
takes it away again.

216
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,925
(gasping)

217
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,095
I think I'm having chest pains.

218
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,153
(whistling)

219
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,188
-Bart, get your suit on.
-What for?

220
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,862
We're getting our
Christmas picture taken.

221
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,361
You lucked out,
Marge, my man

222
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,993
'cause I'm in
a smiling mood today.

223
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,990
(laughs)

224
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,701
Well good, so get ready

225
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,121
and before you know it
we'll be at the Try-N-Save.

226
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,540
Try-N-Save?

227
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,329
(loud whistle)

228
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,622
Oh, my teapots
are ready.

229
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,076
If you ever set foot
in this store again

230
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,667
you'll be spending
Christmas

231
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,002
in Juvenile Hall...

232
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,206
Juvenile Hall...
Juvenile Hall...

233
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,797
(cell door slams)

234
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,972
MAN:
Stand behind the yellow line!

235
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,091
You will now receive
your Christmas presents

236
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,308
donated by the Port Authority
lost and found office.

237
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,139
Pass your chit to Santa
to receive your gift!

238
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,145
If you do not have a chit,
you will not receive a gift.

239
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:50,858
Wow, the March 8th
newspaper.

240
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,941
Cool! A book of carpet samples.

241
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,988
Come on, new bike.

242
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,869
Oh, a soiled wig.

243
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,041
(garbled) <i>Merry Christmas</i>
<i>and a Happy New Year.</i>

244
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,995
(gulping)

245
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,632
MARGE: Bart, what's
taking so long?

246
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,588
If you're having that problem
with your zipper

247
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,999
I can send your father up.

248
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,457
Oh, no, I'm not.

249
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,764
What's the matter
with your face?

250
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,181
Is that a fake nose?

251
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,890
Are you wearing
chin putty?

252
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,140
I don't have to listen
to these wild allegations.

253
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,599
Please, Bart,
no more pranks.

254
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,018
It would mean
so much to me

255
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,856
if we could have

256
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,781
just one nice
family photo.

257
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Hey!

258
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,195
I don't remember
saying that!

259
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,115
Uh-oh, almost forgot
to lock the doors.

260
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,248
(moaning)

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,250
I hope you're going

262
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,915
to the Valley Vista
Try-N-Save, kid

263
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,673
'cause you don't want
to come to my store.

264
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,546
Cat-feesh?

265
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,142
So we're just going to do this photo
and get out, right?

266
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,305
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom.

267
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,773
I want to look
at the pets

268
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,153
and write things
on the typewriters

269
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,269
and see if the new
dictionaries are in!

270
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,305
Okay.

271
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,898
I want to price some
flip-flops

272
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,483
and smell the new tires

273
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,278
and consult the pharmacist
for some free medical advice.

274
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,611
Sure, we're going
to have a great day.

275
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,027
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom.

276
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,315
Right, Bart?

277
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,578
Bart?

278
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,579
What's wrong, honey?

279
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,370
Uh-oh!

280
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,214
Somebody's
got tired little legs.

281
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,620
(grunts)

282
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,174
Mmm, wonder where
the flip-flops are...

283
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,257
Menswear?

284
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,801
Maybe it's sporting goods?

285
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,255
Wait, no, sleepwear.

286
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,604
Oh, probably, better living.

287
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,180
(loud sigh)

288
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,175
-(alarms blaring)
-(scared shudder)

289
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,387
Oh, Homie,
look at that watch.

290
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,808
I've always wanted
a watch like that.

291
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:57,487
Well, maybe someone
will give you one for Christmas.

292
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,108
<i>Now she'll really be surprised</i>

293
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,105
<i>when she opens</i>
<i>that ironing board cover.</i>

294
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,663
{\an8}HOMER: Pfft, must have been
a pretty slow century.

295
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,333
(gasps)

296
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,587
The store detective!

297
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,378
Hey, Ansel Adams,
let's go!

298
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,762
Take the photo!

299
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,548
Wait, wait! I don't want
Maggie's face

300
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,052
hidden behind
that pacifier!

301
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,014
(whimpering)

302
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,466
Don't worry, mama.

303
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,814
I can put a smile
on baby's face.

304
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,019
Okay, sugarplum

305
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,598
it's time to meet
Mr. Funny-voice.

306
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,095
(high-pitched voice)
Hello, aluh...

307
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,687
(normal voice)
Oh, it's just air.

308
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,322
Well, come on.
Hurry up.

309
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,280
Okay, people.
One, two, three.

310
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,066
I thought I told you:

311
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,326
No returns for
busted merchandise.

312
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,988
What are you doing to my son?

313
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,077
I'm afraid your son
broke the 11th commandment.

314
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,923
Thou shalt not steal.

315
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,418
That's crazy.

316
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,420
Bart's not
a shoplifter.

317
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,961
He's just a little boy.

318
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,424
Oh, sure, now he's
just a little boy

319
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,085
stealing little toys.

320
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,433
But someday he'll
be a grown man

321
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,469
stealing stadiums
and... quarries.

322
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,104
My son may not
be perfect

323
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,720
but I know in my heart
he's not a shoplifter.

324
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,310
Fine! Play the tape.

325
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,805
Then everyone can see
you've got the wrong boy.

326
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,532
Wait!

327
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,238
Mom, I don't want
you to see this.

328
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,105
I did it.

329
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,535
LISA: Bart, I wouldn't have
expected this even from you!

330
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,330
My son's a thief.

331
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,214
Oh, Bart.

332
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,875
Stealing?! How could you?!

333
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,965
Haven't you learned
anything from that guy

334
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,430
who gives those sermons at church--
captain what's-his-name?

335
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,972
We live in a
society of laws!

336
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,346
Why do you
think I took you

337
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,103
to all those Police
Academy movies?

338
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,564
For fun?!

339
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,524
Well, I didn't hear
anybody laughing!

340
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,975
Did you?!

341
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,444
Except at that guy
who made sound effects.

342
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,645
(blubbering Doppler effect)

343
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,645
(muffled zooming)

344
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,986
(blows raspberry)

345
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,280
Honk, honk!

346
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,373
(imitates explosion)

347
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,869
(laughs)

348
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,160
Where was I?

349
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,333
Oh, yeah.
Stay out of my booze.

350
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,122
Mom, I'm really sorry.

351
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,497
I know you are.

352
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,344
Is there anything
I can do?

353
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,339
I don't know.

354
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,551
Why don't you
go to bed?

355
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,932
Okay.

356
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,233
(sighs despondently)

357
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,350
Man, I thought Mom was going
to scream me stupid.

358
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,017
She didn't even
raise her voice.

359
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,515
I admit I haven't known
Mom as long as you have

360
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,358
but I know when
she's really upset.

361
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,573
Her heart won't
just wipe clean

362
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,493
like this bathroom
counter top.

363
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,201
It absorbs everything
that touches it

364
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,371
like this bathroom rug.

365
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,371
Really? You think
this might be

366
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,873
one of those
forever-type things?

367
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,536
(muffled):
I don't know.

368
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,294
(squishing)

369
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,047
MARGE:
<i>♪ Lisa's on the sleepy train ♪</i>

370
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,379
<i>♪ To rest her weary head ♪</i>

371
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,875
<i>♪ Her ticket is a candy cane ♪</i>

372
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,468
<i>♪ Made out of gingerbread ♪</i>

373
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,473
(Lisa giggles)

374
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,564
LISA:
Good night, Mom.

375
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,389
Good night,
sweetheart.

376
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,104
(footsteps approaching)

377
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,484
Oh, great.

378
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,400
The tuck-in express
is right on time.

379
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,362
Good night.

380
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,991
I figured out
the boy's punishment.

381
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,573
First, he's grounded.

382
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,038
No leaving the house,
not even for school.

383
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,619
Second, no eggnog.

384
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,964
In fact, no nog period.

385
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,169
And third, absolutely
no stealing for three months.

386
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,841
I always thought
I understood

387
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,089
my special little guy

388
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,460
but somewhere
along the road

389
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,257
his hand slipped away

390
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,430
from mine.

391
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,428
Ah, what are you gonna do?

392
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,762
(groans softly)

393
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,517
He's not my little
baby anymore.

394
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,269
Maybe I mother him too much.

395
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,152
(yawns)

396
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,490
Hey, Mom, you
didn't wake me up.

397
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,826
Here's your
hot chocolate.

398
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,121
You didn't put
my marshmallow in.

399
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,615
I think you're old enough
to do it yourself now.

400
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,418
Okay. I can handle that.

401
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,138
Hey!

402
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,759
Give me a slice.

403
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,636
Milhouse, do you ever worry

404
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,135
that your Mom
might stop loving you?

405
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,267
What? I'm more worried
about piranhas.

406
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,234
Did you see that movie

407
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,525
where they sent a nuclear submarine
to fight the piranhas

408
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,439
and one of them swims
right down the periscope

409
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,487
and bites the guy in the eye,
and he goes:

410
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,031
(screams)

411
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,164
and that old lady
told him it would happen?!

412
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,991
Yeah. That was pretty good.

413
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,328
How come you're not
playing Bonestorm?

414
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,122
Ah, it got boring.

415
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,956
I'm really into
this cup and ball now.

416
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,841
Whoa! Wow! Whoa-ho-ho!

417
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,169
Man, you never know

418
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,303
which way this crazy
ball's going to go.

419
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,591
Yeah, right. You're just
trying to trick me

420
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,594
because you don't
want me playing

421
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,965
with your video game.

422
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,432
Here. Go ahead.

423
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,063
No. Let me try
the cup and ball.

424
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,349
Get your own!

425
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,022
Come on, don't be
a cup-and-ball hog.

426
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,521
Hey, give it!
That's my --

427
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,732
Milhouse, come on!
Give me the cup and ball.

428
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,112
Cup and ball hog!
Oink, oink!

429
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,978
Mom! Bart's smoking!

430
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,186
All right. Out, out.

431
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,395
Go, go, go, go.

432
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,815
Miss Milhouse, what are
you...

433
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,903
Okay, okay, okay.

434
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,357
I won't bug Milhouse

435
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,077
but, well...
Mrs. Van Houten

436
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,578
this is going to
sound kind of dumb

437
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,791
but can I hang out with you
while you do Mom stuff?

438
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,303
Who are Dan
and Sherry Adler?

439
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,472
Just friends of ours.

440
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,800
Oh. And who is Warren Burke?

441
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,845
Oh, he used to tune our piano

442
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,809
before we got rid of it.

443
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,679
He grew up
in Mechanicsburg.

444
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,346
-Oh, really?
-Mm.

445
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,095
Tell me I'm good.

446
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,437
(Marge laughing)

447
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,324
Oh, hey, that's Mom!

448
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,071
She's happy again.

449
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,950
You guys made a snowman family?

450
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,492
Check it out, boy.

451
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,826
It's like looking
into a living snow mirror.

452
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,582
Why didn't you
wait for me?

453
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,254
I didn't think
you'd mind.

454
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,342
I figured you were getting
a little too old for this.

455
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,339
But you can still make one.

456
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,340
There's some snow left

457
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,011
under the car.

458
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,312
(moans)

459
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,977
Stupid family.

460
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,525
Hey, Simpson.

461
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,989
Look what I swiped
from Try-N-Save.

462
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,069
It's a replacement tire
for a wheelbarrow.

463
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,156
Huh.

464
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,580
I knew you'd like it.

465
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,198
(laughs)

466
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,082
Everybody thinks
I'm the black sheep.

467
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,165
Well, I'll show them
what a black sheep can do.

468
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,625
Mom...

469
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,216
this fake snow
is making me dizzy.

470
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,722
We're almost finished.

471
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,473
There's just a
little bit of green left.

472
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,176
(humming)

473
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,596
There you are.

474
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,984
You can help me
spray the cookies.

475
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,562
Are you hiding something?

476
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,517
What do you have
under your jacket?

477
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,517
Nothing.

478
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,778
Oh, Bart. Not again!

479
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,989
Give it to me.

480
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,529
I told you,
I don't have anything.

481
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,532
You can't hide from me
in this house, Bart.

482
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,994
I spend 23 hours
a day here.

483
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,198
(laughing)

484
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,577
Get him, Ma.

485
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,174
There's no place
left to run, Bart.

486
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,290
Hand it over.

487
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,375
Oh, Bart.

488
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,092
I can't believe you did this.

489
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,635
I wanted to surprise you
for Christmas.

490
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:06,268
Oh, sweetie, this is the best
present a mother could get!

491
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,728
(loud smooching)

492
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,479
I love you so much!

493
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,311
My little bitty Barty!

494
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,284
Mom!

495
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,454
Since I got
my present early

496
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,701
I think you should get
yours early too.

497
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,293
Bart got a present early?!

498
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,538
Then I should get a present early!
I want a present!

499
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,750
Lisa, you have to wait.

500
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,160
(groans)

501
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,958
Okay. This is
the worst Christmas ever.

502
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,842
Now I know you
love video games

503
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,209
and I asked the clerk
which is the one every boy wants.

504
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,168
You got me...

505
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,759
(stifled groan)

506
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,345
Oh... yeah!

507
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,560
