of winning the lottery?

65
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,402
I don't know.

66
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,519
{\an8}Why, you are more likely

67
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,727
{\an8}to be run over by a car.

68
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,317
{\an8}Or be hit by lightning.

69
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,487
{\an8}Or murdered by an acquaintance.

70
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,454
If you understood probability,

71
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,205
you would never play the lottery.

{\an8}Guys, this science exhibit

00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,838
{\an8}told me how stupid it is
to play the lottery.

84

{\an8}No reason. Just... 22.

85
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,276
{\an8}And I'm 69.

86
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,533

99

{\an8}But we're already at a bar.

100
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,110

and hot dog water.

101

105
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,871
money.

112
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,377

with your share of the money?

115
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,098
I'm sure he just got held up in traffic.

116
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,483
Yeah, that's probably what happened.

117
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,728
I wonder what's keeping Carl.

118
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,823
I hope our friend wasn't in an accident.

119
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:19,148
I'm glad we're the kind of people
who are worried about Carl's safety

120
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,565
instead of thinking
that he ripped us off.

121
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,034
I wasn't thinking that.

122
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,655
-Carl's our good friend.
-Our good friend.

123
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,663
Yeah, good old Carl.

124
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:34,076

I don't feel at all suspicious of Carl.

128
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,675
Drive faster because
of the power of friendship.

authentic French-Canadian sugar pie.

150

151

Mmm.
Thanks for the sugar pie, Carl.

152
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,406
Hey, what's this?

153
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,624
"I've gone home.
Good-bye forever, Carl Carlson."

154

Where'd you go, Carl?

155
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,129
Had plans for that money, too.

156
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,594
I was gonna be one of those guys
who's really into hot sauce, you know?

157
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,596
Hot sauce suspenders,
hot sauce pajamas.

158
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,469
Bolo tie with a little

161
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,231
Or you. Or you.

162
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,073

It's the ultimate screw-over.

164
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,400

165
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,565
to give you the ultimate screw-over.

166
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,494
He said he went home,
and his passport is gone.

167
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,084

168
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,739
-Uh...
-Uh... I don't know.

169
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,657

We don't go digging into the past.

172
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,592
We talk about guy stuff.

173
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,379
Like baseball and trucks

174
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,013
and when guys lift too much weight
and their bungus drops out.

175
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,760
You know, guy stuff.

176
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,392
Maybe if you'd talked less
about guy stuff,

177
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,850
you'd know more about
your so-called friend.

178
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,680
Well, it don't matter no more, Midge.

179
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,435
Carl is gone, and we're already
auditioning replacements.

180
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,515
This could not be more offensive.

181
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,148
Man!

182
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,574
Oh, of course.

183
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,202
-Ugh!
-Hmm.

184
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,197
Hey, hey, get that out of here!

185
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,292
I don't ever want to see that
moolah-stealing jackpot thief again!

186
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,078
Wait a minute.

187
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,042
Something's reflected in the lenses
of Carl's sunglasses.

188
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,384
I just need to get closer.

189
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,465
He's looking at a geyser.

190
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,129
And there's a sign in front of it!

191
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,348
Oh... it's too small to read.

192
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,391
LENNY: Oh, it's backwards.

193
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,805
MOE: Try this.

194
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,403
LENNY: "Strokkur Geysir."

195
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,309
Hmm.

196
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,227
The geyser is one of the most famous

197
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,646
natural wonders in Iceland.

198
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,645
I guess that's where Carl's from.

199
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,277
Ice-land?
Is that even a real place?

200
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,575
I thought it was
Superman's Superman cave.

201
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,199
Iceland keeps the most detailed
family records

202
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,156
of any country in the world.

203
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,077
There! Carl was adopted...

204
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,551
...by a couple who lives
outside Reykjavik.

205
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,009
Well, if that's Carl's home,
then that's where our money is!

206
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,970
And that's where we're going.
We got to pack.

207
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,892
HOMER: (whistles)
50 bucks per bag?

208
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,438
I guess I'm only bringing
one guitar on this revenge trip.

209
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,283
You're going so far away.

210
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,490
I'll miss you.

211
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,280
Baby, I'm going for us.

212
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,493
That money is going to
dig us a swimming pool

213
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,164
that'll take our broken family
and make it whole.

214
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,493
We're not broken.

215
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,618
-We're broken.
-We're pretty broken.

216
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,785
(grumbles)
How am I going to sleep

217
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,423
if someone isn't pushing me
all the way to the very edge of the bed?

218
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,012
I've already taken care of that.

219
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,552
Oh... oh, that's perfect.

220
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,810
I can't wait to see the smile
on Carl's face when we surprise him.

221
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,984
I call first hug.

222
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,612
Hey, Lenny,
when are you gonna wise up?

223
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,069
Carl never wants to see us again.

224
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,150
I'm done talking to you!

225
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,607
This is funny.

226
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:19,327
It says here Iceland is green,
and Greenland is icy.

227
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,660
The Vikings switched the names
to trick everybody.

228
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,207
-(all laughing)
-Those Vikings.

229
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,751
-That's pretty good.
-Great gag!

230
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,134
Hey, Vikings,
it's still pretty damn cold!

231
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,092
I only packed shorts.

232
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,893
Excuse me, uh,
we're looking for our friend.

233
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,354
He's, uh... he's about so tall,

234
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,185
uh, wears a jacket,

235
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,690
he's, um, got no visible tattoos...

236
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,943
-Just say he's black, Moe.
-You say he's black!

237
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,196
His name is Carl Carlson.

238
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,698
Carl Carlson!

239
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,370
His family has been hated
for 1,000 years.

240
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,449
How do you know about Carl's family?

241
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,334
Our country is very small,

242
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,751
very judgmental, and very nosy.

243
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,040
Ingimar Ogmundsson,
how progresses your gonorrhea?

244
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,125
It heals, but slowly.

245
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,132
Why does everybody hate Carl's family?

246
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,924
{\an8}MAN: Here's why.

247
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,014
{\an8}This saga tells of how
Carl Carlson's family

248
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,764
were the watchmen of the coast,

249
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,465
always keeping an eye out
for invading hordes.

250
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,176
Iceland's safety depended
on their vigilance.

251
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,522
But the Carlsons failed in their duty.

252
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,154
The enemy invaded,
laying waste to our lava fields,

253
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,453
burning our sweaters,
and feasting upon our tiny horses.

254
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,859
Apparently, screwing over your friends

255
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,488
is in Carl's blood-- his adopted blood.

256
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,291
All right, this is it,
Carl's family home.

257
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,916
Twenty-two...

258
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,012
Ooh, phew, oh, that's a lot of letters.

259
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,089
22 Hjorleifsstrati.

260
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,094
So that's why 22
was Carl's lottery number.

261
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:04,517
Yeah, and that's why his sweatpants
say "Hjorleifsstrati" across the butt.

262
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,928
(grunts)
The gates are locked.

263
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,397
Well, then we'll just have to wait
for him to come out.

Oh, man, stakeouts are so boring.

I wish I had something to look at.

266
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,160
Well, I guess I'll just read
the car rental contract again.

267
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,818
Damage waiver, check.

268
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,116
Return with full tank of gas, check.

270

you had for borrowing the money.

All right, look, I admit it.
I gave you the ultimate screw-over.

But I did it to clear my family's name.

289
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,753
Everyone blames the barbarian invasion
on my ancestors.

290
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,586
But that saga had a missing page.

291
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,172
Oh, yeah... a page was torn out.

292
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,678
My family's always believed

293
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,969
that we fought bravely
against the invaders,

294
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,013
and the missing page will prove it.

295
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,467
I took the lottery money
to buy that page

296
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,178

297
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,768
Why didn't you just tell us?
We're your friends.

298

00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,945
That'll show Carl for
de-friending us in real life!

344
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,778
<i>I know Carl did you wrong,</i>

345
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,083
<i>but is destroying something</i>
<i>he cares that much about</i>

346
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,368
<i>really going to make you feel good?</i>

347
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,542
Well, we won't know that till after.

348
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,871
<i>Just read the saga</i>
<i>and see what it says.</i>

349
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,288
But how can we learn to read
ancient Icelandic?

350
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,458
With these.

351
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,166
Yeah, my doctor says
it's better for me not to sleep.

352
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,758
-Thorn?
-Yes!

353
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,184
Forvitinn.

354
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,682
I can't do this, I can't do this!

355
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,934
You can't not do it!

356
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,266
Okay, let's see what this thing says.

357
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,942
"When the barbarian invaders came,

358
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,771
<i>the Carlsons met them</i>
<i>with their weapons ready..."</i>

359
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,977
<i>LENNY:</i>
<i>Wow, Carl's family really was brave.</i>

360
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,947
<i>HOMER: "...weapons which they immediately</i>
<i>threw down in surrender.</i>

361
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,869
<i>The Carlsons then</i>
<i>let the barbarians in the back gate</i>

362
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,368
<i>and joined in the sacking, the looting,</i>

363
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,161
<i>and the volcano-ing</i>
<i>of the village elders.</i>

364
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,575
<i>The Carlsons then wrote down this saga</i>

365
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:24,544
<i>so no one would ever forget</i>
<i>their treachery and cowardice."</i>

366
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,416
Carl's family was even worse
than people thought.

367
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,585
They were the original ultimate scumbags.

368
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,344
Carl betrayed his friends,
blew the lottery money...

369
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,347
-all for nothing.
-Hey, guys...

370
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,429
I think I feel bad for Carl.

371
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,387
{\an8}(speaking Icelandic)

372
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,646
Attention, everyone in Iceland.

373
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,650
We have an important announcement.

374
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,942
Take a break from your dreary lives

375
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,526
to hear Americans lecture you.

376
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,071
(all exclaim)

377
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,414
Is this everyone?

378
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,779
No.

379
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,334
Yes.

380
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,738
I've learned something
about the people of Iceland.

381
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:02,617
You have endured barbarian invasions,
total financial collapse,

382
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,496
and a lesbian prime minister.

383
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,673
You've managed to survive
on a craphole island

384
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,673
that looks like the moon
and smells like rotten eggs.

385
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,006
And to do that,
you have to be stubborn.

386
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,433
But I ask you to put aside
your stubbornness

387
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,352
while I tell you about Carl Carlson.

388
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,141
Shame on Carl's family!

389
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,975
The blood of 1,000 tiny horses
is on their hands.

390
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,732
Doesn't matter what happened
1,000 years ago,

391
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,435
for Carl Carlson's honor
has been redeemed

392
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,566
by the deeds of Carl Carlson.

393
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,113
Carl Carlson who helped me move,

394
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,987
-even though I moved the week before.
-(crowd gasping and murmuring)

395
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,905
Yeah, and when we were
painting my house,

396
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,333
Carl Carlson brought
that blue tape,

397
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,922
you know, that makes you really look
like you know what you're doing.

398
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,578
You peel it off, and you got that
super straight line there.

399
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,548
-(crowd gasping)
-And when he brings

400
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,838
a six-pack to my house,
he doesn't take the extras home with him.

401
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,433
Carl Carlson leaves them in the fridge.

402
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,509
(crowd gasping)

403
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:00,223
Carl Carlson is our friend,
even if he doesn't believe it.

404
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,391
If we can forgive Carl
for stealing our lottery winnings,

405
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,186
maybe youse can find it
in youse's hearts

406
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,811
to forgive his ancestors.

407
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,357
The many small kindnesses
of Carl Carlson

408
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,152
have redeemed his family forever.

409
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,819
Mom, Dad,

410
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,117
our family can show our face in public

411
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,161
for the first time in 1,000 years.

412
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,627
Ai. Ai.

413
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,049
How can you say these men
are not your true friends?

414
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,132
I... I can't!

415
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,177
(sobbing) I can't!

416
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,266
CROWD: Ai.

417
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,109
Guys, thanks for teaching me

418
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,320
the true meaning of male friendship.

419
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,280
The stuff that comes from in here...

420
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,740
that is guy stuff.

421
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,950
We don't get together
to share our emotions.

422
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,991
We get together to escape them.

423
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,044
Yeah, I'd tell you guys
I love you, but, uh,

424
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,289
I don't want to say it,
and you don't want to hear it.

425
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,581
To nothing!

426
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,926
Okay, everyone,
get ready to see your brand-new...

427
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,814
-Oh, oh! (laughs)
-What is it, what is it, what is it?

428
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,941
-...keg-pools!
-Yay!

429
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,151
Hey! Aah!

430
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,903
(kids laughing)

431
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,494
(grunting)

432
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,699
Fine. I'm going home.
